<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) United States development cooperation policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world's limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">United States development cooperation policy should emphasize five principal goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alleviation of the worst physical manifestations of poverty among the world's poor majority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the promotion of conditions enabling developing countries to achieve self-sustaining economic growth with equitable distribution of benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the encouragement of development processes in which individual civil and economic rights are respected and enhanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the integration of the developing countries into an open and equitable international economic system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the promotion of good governance through combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United States foreign policy and that United States development resources be effectively and efficiently utilized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of development-related activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the policy guidance of the Secretary of State, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should have the responsibility for coordinating all United States development-related activities.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;175, Dec. 12, 2003, 117 Stat. 2482, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On June 24, 2002, President Bush stated &lsquo;Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states &lsquo;refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts&rsquo;, take &lsquo;the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts&rsquo;, and &lsquo;deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by United States law from receiving United States assistance because it has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for purposes of section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) and other relevant provisions of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides &lsquo;safe haven and support to several terrorist groups&rsquo;, fewer United States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect to any other country that is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&mdash;General Command, maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory, and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran through Syria.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for &lsquo;strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Approximately 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining its political independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have passed seven bills and resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) On March 3, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that it is the objective of the United States to &lsquo;let Lebanon be ruled by the Lebanese people without the presence of [the Syrian] occupation army&rsquo;.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:461 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United Nations Secretary General.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Even in the face of this United Nations certification that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah continues to attack Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the pretense that Shebaa Farms is territory from which Israel was required to withdraw by Security Counsel Resolution 425, and Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah and other militant organizations continue to attack civilian targets in Israel.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Syria will not allow Lebanon&mdash;a sovereign country&mdash;to fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which continues to attack Israeli positions, allows Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate freely in the area, and maintains thousands of rockets along Israel's northern border, destabilizing the entire region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) On February 12, 2003, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet stated the following with respect to the Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah: &lsquo;[A]s an organization with capability and worldwide presence [it] is [al Qaeda's] equal if not a far more capable organization *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [T]hey're a notch above in many respects, in terms of in their relationship with the Iranians and the training they receive, [which] puts them in a state-sponsored category with a potential for lethality that's quite great.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, President Bush declared that the United States will &lsquo;work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) The Government of Syria continues to develop and deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) According to the December 2001 unclassified Central Intelligence Agency report entitled &lsquo;Foreign Missile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat through 2015&rsquo;, &lsquo;Syria maintains a ballistic missile and rocket force of hundreds of FROG rockets, Scuds, and SS&ndash;21 SRBMs [and] Syria has developed [chemical weapons] warheads for its Scuds&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development and production of biological and chemical weapons and has a nuclear research and development program that is cause for concern.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's &lsquo;Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions&rsquo;, released January 7, 2003: &lsquo;[Syria] already holds a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin but apparently is trying to develop more toxic and persistent nerve agents. Syria remains dependent on foreign sources for key elements of its [chemical weapons] program, including precursor chemicals and key production equipment. It is highly probable that Syria also is developing an offensive [biological weapons] capability.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) On May 6, 2002, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, stated: &lsquo;The United States also knows that Syria has long had a chemical warfare program. It has a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin and is engaged in research and development of the more toxic and persistent nerve agent VX. Syria, which has signed but not ratified the [Biological Weapons Convention], is pursuing the development of biological weapons and is able to produce at least small amounts of biological warfare agents.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's &lsquo;Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions&rsquo;, released January 7, 2003: &lsquo;Russia and Syria have approved a draft cooperative program on cooperation on civil nuclear power. In principal, broader access to Russian expertise provides opportunities for Syria to expand its indigenous capabilities, should it decide to pursue nuclear weapons.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 UST 483), which entered force on March 5, 1970, and to which Syria is a party, Syria has undertaken not to acquire or produce nuclear weapons and has accepted full scope safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency to detect diversions of nuclear materials from peaceful activities to the production of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) Syria is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention or the Biological Weapons Convention, which entered into force on April 29, 1997, and on March 26, 1975, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised Secretary of State Powell in February 2001 to end violations of Security Council Resolution 661, which restricted the sale of oil and other commodities by Saddam Hussein's regime, except to the extent authorized by other relevant resolutions, but this pledge was never fulfilled.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(26) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil during Saddam Hussein's regime earned Syria $50,000,000 or more per month as Syria continued to sell its own Syrian oil at market prices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(27) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil earned Saddam Hussein's regime $2,000,000 per day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(28) On March 28, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld warned: &lsquo;[W]e have information that shipments of military supplies have been crossing the border from Syria into Iraq, including night-vision goggles *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* These deliveries pose a direct threat to the lives of coalition forces. We consider such trafficking as hostile acts, and will hold the Syrian government accountable for such shipments.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(29) According to Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, members of the United Nations are elected as nonpermanent members of the United Nations Security Council with &lsquo;due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to other purposes of the Organization&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(30) Despite Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, Syria was elected on October 8, 2001, to a 2-year term as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council beginning January 1, 2002, and served as President of the Security Council during June 2002 and August 2003.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(31) On March 31, 2003, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Sharra, made the Syrian regime's intentions clear when he explicitly stated that &lsquo;Syria's interest is to see the invaders defeated in Iraq&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(32) On April 13, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld charged that &lsquo;busloads&rsquo; of Syrian fighters entered Iraq with &lsquo;hundreds of thousands of dollars&rsquo; and leaflets offering rewards for dead American soldiers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(33) On September 16, 2003, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, appeared before the Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia of the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives, and underscored Syria's &lsquo;hostile actions&rsquo; toward coalition forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Under Secretary Bolton added that: &lsquo;Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria permitted volunteers to <!-- PDFPage:462 -->pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [Syria's] behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syria's WMD capabilities.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(34) During his appearance before the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives on September 25, 2003, Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, III, Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, stated that out of the 278 third-country nationals who were captured by coalition forces in Iraq, the &lsquo;single largest group are Syrians&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Government of Syria should immediately and unconditionally halt support for terrorism, permanently and openly declare its total renunciation of all forms of terrorism, and close all terrorist offices and facilities in Syria, including the offices of Hamas, Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&mdash;General Command;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Government of Syria should&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) immediately and unconditionally stop facilitating transit from Syria to Iraq of individuals, military equipment, and all lethal items, except as authorized by the Coalition Provisional Authority or a representative, internationally recognized Iraqi government;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) cease its support for &lsquo;volunteers&rsquo; and terrorists who are traveling from and through Syria into Iraq to launch attacks; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) undertake concrete, verifiable steps to deter such behavior and control the use of territory under Syrian control;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Government of Syria should immediately declare its commitment to completely withdraw its armed forces, including military, paramilitary, and security forces, from Lebanon, and set a firm timetable for such withdrawal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Government of Lebanon should deploy the Lebanese armed forces to all areas of Lebanon, including South Lebanon, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982), in order to assert the sovereignty of the Lebanese state over all of its territory, and should evict all terrorist and foreign forces from southern Lebanon, including Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Government of Syria should halt the development and deployment of medium- and long-range surface-to-surface missiles and cease the development and production of biological and chemical weapons;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Governments of Lebanon and Syria should enter into serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with the Government of Israel in order to realize a full and permanent peace;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian and educational assistance to the people of Lebanon only through appropriate private, nongovernmental organizations and appropriate international organizations, until such time as the Government of Lebanon asserts sovereignty and control over all of its territory and borders and achieves full political independence, as called for in United Nations Security Council Resolution 520; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) as a violator of several key United Nations Security Council resolutions and as a nation that pursues policies which undermine international peace and security, Syria should not have been permitted to join the United Nations Security Council or serve as the Security Council's President, and should be removed from the Security Council.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Syria should bear responsibility for attacks committed by Hizballah and other terrorist groups with offices, training camps, or other facilities in Syria, or bases in areas of Lebanon occupied by Syria;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States will work to deny Syria the ability to support acts of international terrorism and efforts to develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Secretary of State will continue to list Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism until Syria ends its support for terrorism, including its support of Hizballah and other terrorist groups in Lebanon and its hosting of terrorist groups in Damascus, and comes into full compliance with United States law relating to terrorism and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the full restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity is in the national security interest of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Syria is in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) through its continued occupation of Lebanese territory and its encroachment upon Lebanon's political independence;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Syria's obligation to withdraw from Lebanon is not conditioned upon progress in the Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-Lebanese peace process but derives from Syria's obligation under Security Council Resolution 520;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs threaten the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Syria will be held accountable for any harm to Coalition armed forces or to any United States citizen in Iraq if the government of Syria is found to be responsible due to its facilitation of terrorist activities and its shipments of military supplies to Iraq; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the United States will not provide any assistance to Syria and will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until Syria ends all support for terrorism, withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon, and halts the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and medium- and long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 5. PENALTIES AND AUTHORIZATION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Penalties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Until the President makes the determination that Syria meets all the requirements described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (d) and certifies such determination to Congress in accordance with such subsection&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">African Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;381, Oct. 19, 1994, 108 Stat. 3513, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;African Conflict Resolution Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa's future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa's children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the ex<!-- PDFPage:469 -->perience of elder statesmen. Groups such as the All African Council of Churches have assisted in defusing conflicts. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has sought to address the conflict in Liberia by deploying an African peacekeeping force. The Southern African states have been working to prevent a crisis in Lesotho. The Intergovernmental Authority on Desertification and Drought (IGADD) has been engaged in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The Organization of African Unity, under the leadership of Secretary General Salim Salim, has established a conflict resolution mechanism and has been active in mediation and conflict resolution in several African countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>United States Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress declares, therefore, that a key goal for United States foreign policy should be to help institutionalize conflict resolution capability in Africa.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151&ndash;1. Development assistance policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Principal purpose of bilateral development assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to build and maintain the social and economic institutions necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth and to provide opportunities to improve the quality of life for their people depend primarily upon successfully marshalling their own economic and human resources. The Congress recognizes that the magnitude of these efforts exceeds the resources of developing countries and therefore accepts that there will be a long-term need for wealthy countries to contribute additional resources for development purposes. The United States should take the lead in concert with other nations to mobilize such resources from public and private sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Provision of development resources must be adapted to the needs and capabilities of specific developing countries. United States assistance to countries with low per capita incomes which have limited access to private external resources should primarily be provided on concessional terms. Assistance to other developing countries should generally consist of pro<!-- PDFPage:475 -->grams which facilitate their access to private capital markets, investment, and technical skills, whether directly through guarantee or reimbursable programs by the United States Government or indirectly through callable capital provided to the international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Bilateral assistance and United States participation in multilateral institutions shall emphasize programs in support of countries which pursue development strategies designed to meet basic human needs and achieve self-sustaining growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the principal purpose of United States bilateral development assistance is to help the poor majority of people in developing countries to participate in a process of equitable growth through productive work and to influence decisions that shape their lives, with the goal of increasing their incomes and their access to public services which will enable them to satisfy their basic needs and lead lives of decency, dignity, and hope. Activities shall be emphasized that effectively involve the poor in development by expanding their access to the economy through services and institutions at the local level, increasing their participation in the making of decisions that affect their lives, increasing labor-intensive production and the use of appropriate technology, expanding productive investment and services out from major cities to small towns and rural areas, and otherwise providing opportunities for the poor to improve their lives through their own efforts. Participation of the United States in multilateral institutions shall also place appropriate emphasis on these principles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Form of assistance; principles governing assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance under this part should be used not only for the purpose of transferring financial resources to developing countries, but also to help countries solve development problems in accordance with a strategy that aims to insure wide participation of the poor in the benefits of development on a sustained basis. Moreover, assistance shall be provided in a prompt and effective manner, using appropriate United States institutions for carrying out this strategy. In order to achieve these objectives and the broad objectives set forth in section 2151 of this title and in subsection (a) of this section, bilateral development assistance authorized by this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Development is primarily the responsibility of the people of the developing countries themselves. Assistance from the United States shall be used in support of, rather than substitution for, the self-help efforts that are essential to successful development programs and shall be concentrated in those countries that take positive steps to help themselves. Maximum effort shall be made, in the administration of subchapter I of this chapter, to stimulate the involvement of the people in the development process through the encouragement of democratic participation in private and local governmental activities and institution building appropriate to the requirements of the recipient countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Development planning must be the responsibility of each sovereign country. United States assistance should be administered in a collaborative style to support the development goals chosen by each country receiving assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States bilateral development assistance should give high priority to undertakings submitted by host governments which directly improve the lives of the poorest of their people and their capacity to participate in the development of their countries, while also helping such governments enhance their planning, technical, and administrative capabilities needed to insure the success of such undertakings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development assistance provided under this part shall be concentrated in countries which will make the most effective use of such assistance to help satisfy basic human needs of poor people through equitable growth, especially in those countries having the greatest need for outside assistance. In order to make possible consistent and informed judgments in this respect, the President shall assess the commitment and progress of countries in moving toward the objectives and purposes of this part by utilizing criteria, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increase in agricultural productivity per unit of land through small-farm, labor-intensive agriculture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduction of infant mortality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) control of population growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) promotion of greater equality of income distribution, including measures such as more progressive taxation and more equitable returns to small farmers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) reduction of rates of unemployment and underemployment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increase in literacy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) progress in combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability in the public and private sector.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) United States development assistance should focus on critical problems in those functional sectors which affect the lives of the majority of the people in the developing countries; food production and nutrition; rural development and generation of gainful employment; population planning and health; environment and natural resources; education, development administration, and human resource development; and energy development and production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) United States assistance shall encourage and promote the participation of women in the national economies of developing countries and the improvement of women's status as an important means of promoting the total development effort.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) United States bilateral assistance shall recognize that the prosperity of developing countries and effective development efforts require the adoption of an overall strategy that promotes the development, production, and efficient utilization of energy and, therefore, consideration shall be given to the full implications of such assistance on the price, availability, and consumption of energy in recipient countries.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:476 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) United States cooperation in development should be carried out to the maximum extent possible through the private sector, including those institutions which already have ties in the developing areas, such as educational institutions, cooperatives, credit unions, free labor unions, and private and voluntary agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the maximum extent practicable, United States private investment should be encouraged in economic and social development programs to which the United States lends support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Assistance shall be planned and utilized to encourage regional cooperation by developing countries in the solution of common problems and the development of shared resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Assistance efforts of the United States shall be planned and furnished to the maximum extent practicable in coordination and cooperation with assistance efforts of other countries, including the planning and implementation of programs and projects on a multilateral and multidonor basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) United States bilateral development assistance should be concentrated on projects which do not involve large-scale capital transfers. However, to the extent that such assistance does involve large-scale capital transfers, it should be furnished in association with contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) United States encouragement of policy reforms is necessary if developing countries are to achieve economic growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Development assistance should, as a fundamental objective, promote private sector activity in open and competitive markets in developing countries, recognizing such activity to be a productive and efficient means of achieving equitable and long term economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) United States cooperation in development should recognize as essential the need of developing countries to have access to appropriate technology in order to improve food and water, health and housing, education and employment, and agriculture and industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) United States assistance should focus on establishing and upgrading the institutional capacities of developing countries in order to promote long term development. An important component of institution building involves training to expand the human resource potential of people in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Economic reform and development of effective institutions of democratic governance are mutually reinforcing. The successful transition of a developing country is dependent upon the quality of its economic and governance institutions. Rule of law, mechanisms of accountability and transparency, security of person, property, and investments, are but a few of the critical governance and economic reforms that underpin the sustainability of broad-based economic growth. Programs in support of such reforms strengthen the capacity of people to hold their governments accountable and to create economic opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Worldwide cooperative effort to overcome aspects of absolute poverty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, recognizing the desirability of overcoming the worst aspects of absolute poverty by the end of this century by, among other measures, substantially lowering infant mortality and birth rates, and increasing life expectancy, food production, literacy, and employment, encourages the President to explore with other countries, through all appropriate channels, the feasibility of a worldwide cooperative effort to overcome the worst aspects of absolute poverty and to assure self-reliant growth in the developing countries by the year 2000.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151a. Agricultural development in rural areas</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization to President to furnish assistance; appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In recognition of the fact that the great majority of the people of developing countries live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture and agricultural-related pursuits for their livelihood, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to alleviate starvation, hunger, and malnutrition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to expand significantly the provision of basic services to rural poor people to enhance their capacity for self-help; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to help create productive farm and off-farm employment in rural areas to provide a more viable economic base and enhance opportunities for improved incomes, living standards, and contributions by rural poor people to the economic and social development of their countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1987. Of these amounts, the President may use such amounts as he deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of section 316 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980. Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,000,000 shall be available only for the purpose of controlling and eradicating amblyomma variegatum (heartwater) in bovine animals in the Caribbean.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use of assistance primarily in aid of rural poor; multilateral infrastructure projects; forestry projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance provided under this section shall be used primarily for activities which are specifically designed to increase the productivity and income of the rural poor, through such means as creation and strengthening of local institutions linked to the regional and national levels; organization of a system of financial institutions which provide both savings and credit services to the poor; stimulation of small, labor-intensive enterprises in rural towns; improvement of marketing facilities and systems; expansion of rural infrastructure and utilities such as farm-to-market roads, water management systems, land improvement, energy, and storage facilities; establishment of more equitable and more secure land tenure arrangements; and creation and strengthening of systems to provide other services and supplies needed by farmers, such as extension, research, training, fertilizer, water, forestry, soil conservation, and improved seed, in ways which assure access to them by small farmers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In circumstances where development of major infrastructure is necessary to achieve the objectives set forth in this section, assistance for that purpose should be furnished under this part in association with significant contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework. Infrastructure projects so assisted should be complemented by other measures to ensure that the benefits of the infrastructure reach the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the accelerating loss of forests and tree cover in developing countries undermines and offsets efforts to improve agricultural production and nutrition and otherwise to meet the basic human needs of the poor. Deforestation results in increased flooding, reduction in water supply for agricultural capacity, loss of firewood and needed wood products, and loss of valuable plants and animals. In order to maintain and increase forest resources, the President is authorized to provide assistance under this section for forestry projects which are essential to fulfill the fundamental purposes of this section. Emphasis shall be given to community woodlots, agroforestry, reforestation, protection of watershed forests, and more effective forest management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increased agricultural production in least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the greatest potential for significantly expanding availability of food for people in rural areas and augmenting world food production at relatively low cost lies in increasing the productivity of small farmers who constitute a majority of the agricultural producers in developing countries. Increasing the emphasis on rural development and expanded food production in the poorest nations of the developing world is a matter of social justice and a principal element contributing to broadly based economic growth, as well as an important factor in alleviating inflation in the industrialized countries. In the allocation of funds under this section, special attention shall be given to increasing agricultural production in countries which have been designated as &ldquo;least developed&rdquo; by the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination with population planning and health programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance provided under this section shall also be used in coordination with programs carried out under section 2151b of this title to help improve nutrition of the people of developing countries through encouragement of increased production of crops with greater nutritional value; improvement of planning, research, and education with respect to nutrition, particularly with reference to improvement and expanded use of indigenously produced foodstuffs; and the undertaking of pilot or demonstration programs explicitly addressing the problem of malnutrition of poor and vulnerable people. In particular, the President is encouraged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to devise and carry out in partnership with developing countries a strategy for programs of nutrition and health improvement for mothers and children, including breast feeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide technical, financial, and material support to individuals or groups at the local level for such programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:478 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of local currency proceeds from sales of commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Local currency proceeds from sales of commodities provided under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] which are owned by foreign governments shall be used whenever practicable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National food security policies and programs; bilateral and multilateral assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to enhance their national food security deserves encouragement as a matter of United States development assistance policy. Measures complementary to assistance for expanding food production in developing countries are needed to help assure that food becomes increasingly available on a regular basis to the poor in such countries. Therefore, United States bilateral assistance under this chapter and the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.], and United States participation in multilateral institutions, shall emphasize policies and programs which assist developing countries to increase their national food security by improving their food policies and management and by strengthening national food reserves, with particular concern for the needs of the poor, through measures encouraging domestic production, building national food reserves, expanding available storage facilities, reducing postharvest food losses, and improving food distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) International Fund for Agricultural Development; participation and contributions; availability of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to carry out the purposes of this section, the President may continue United States participation in and may make contributions to the International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Of the aggregate amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out subchapter I of this chapter, up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 may be made available, by appropriation or by transfer, for United States contributions to the second replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151b. Population planning and health programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that poor health conditions and uncontrolled population growth can vitiate otherwise successful development efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Large families in developing countries are the result of complex social and economic factors which change relatively slowly among the poor majority least affected by economic progress, as well as the result of a lack of effective birth control. Therefore, effective family planning depends upon economic and social change as well as the delivery of services and is often a matter of political and religious sensitivity. While every country has the right to determine its own policies with respect to population growth, voluntary population planning programs can make a substantial contribution to economic development, higher living standards, and improved health and nutrition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Good health conditions are a principal element in improved quality of life and contribute to the individual's capacity to participate in the <!-- PDFPage:480 -->development process, while poor health and debilitating disease can limit productivity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance for voluntary population planning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to increase the opportunities and motivation for family planning and to reduce the rate of population growth, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for voluntary population planning. In addition to the provision of family planning information and services, including also information and services which relate to and support natural family planning methods, and the conduct of directly relevant demographic research, population planning programs shall emphasize motivation for small families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance for health programs; special health needs of children and mothers; Child Survival Fund; promotion of immunization and oral rehydration; control of AIDS and tuberculosis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to contribute to improvements in the health of the greatest number of poor people in developing countries, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for health programs. Assistance under this subsection shall be used primarily for basic integrated health services, safe water and sanitation, disease prevention and control, and related health planning and research. This assistance shall emphasize self-sustaining community-based health programs by means such as training of health auxiliary and other appropriate personnel, support for the establishment and evaluation of projects that can be replicated on a broader scale, measures to improve management of health programs, and other services and supplies to support health and disease prevention programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In carrying out the purposes of this subsection, the President shall promote, encourage, and undertake activities designed to deal directly with the special health needs of children and mothers. Such activities should utilize simple, available technologies which can significantly reduce childhood mortality, such as improved and expanded immunization programs, oral rehydration to combat diarrhoeal diseases, and education programs aimed at improving nutrition and sanitation and at promoting child spacing. In carrying out this paragraph, guidance shall be sought from knowledgeable health professionals from outside the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter. In addition to government-to-government programs, activities pursuant to this paragraph should include support for appropriate activities of the types described in this paragraph which are carried out by international organizations (which may include international organizations receiving funds under part III of this subchapter) and by private and voluntary organizations, and should include encouragement to other donors to support such types of activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition to amounts otherwise available for such purpose, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 for use in carrying out this paragraph. Amounts appropriated under this subparagraph are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Appropriations pursuant to subparagraph (B) may be referred to as the &ldquo;Child Survival Fund&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the promotion of primary health care is a major objective of the foreign assistance program. The Congress further recognizes that simple, relatively low cost means already exist to reduce incidence of communicable diseases among children, mothers, and infants. The promotion of vaccines for immunization, and salts for oral rehydration, therefore, is an essential feature of the health assistance program. To this end, the Congress expects the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter to set as a goal the protection of not less than 80 percent of all children, in those countries in which such agency has established development programs, from immunizable diseases by January 1, 1991. Of the aggregate amounts made available for fiscal year 1987 to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection (relating to the Child Survival Fund) and to carry out subsection (c) of this section (relating to development assistance for health), $50,000,000 shall be used to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to other laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Assistance made available under this subsection and sections 2151b&ndash;2, 2151b&ndash;3, and 2151b&ndash;4 of this title, and assistance made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter to carry out the purposes of this subsection and the provisions cited in this paragraph, may be made available notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts assistance to foreign countries, except for the provisions of this subsection, the provisions of law cited in this paragraph, subsection (f) of this section, section 2394&ndash;1 of this title, and provisions of law that limit assistance to organizations that support or participate in a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization included under the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund heading in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108&ndash;7).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administration of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance under this part shall be administered so as to give particular attention to the interrelationship between (A) population growth, and (B) development and overall improvement in living standards in developing countries, and to the impact of all programs, projects, and activities on population growth. All appropriate activities proposed for financing under this part shall be designed to build motivation for smaller families through modification of economic and social conditions supportive of the desire for large families, in programs such as education in and out of school, nutrition, disease control, maternal and child health services, improvements in the status and employment of women, agricultural production, rural development, and assistance to the urban poor, and through community-based development programs which give recognition to people motivated to limit the size of their families. Population planning programs shall be coordinated with other programs aimed at reducing the in<!-- PDFPage:481 -->fant mortality rate, providing better nutrition for pregnant women and infants, and raising the standard of living of the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Since the problems of malnutrition, disease, and rapid population growth are closely related, planning for assistance to be provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section and under section 2151a of this title shall be coordinated to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Assistance provided under this section shall emphasize low-cost integrated delivery systems for health, nutrition, and family planning for the poorest people, with particular attention to the needs of mothers and young children, using paramedical and auxiliary medical personnel, clinics and health posts, commercial distribution systems, and other modes of community outreach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Research and analysis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Health and population research and analysis carried out under this chapter shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be undertaken to the maximum extent practicable in developing countries by developing country personnel, linked as appropriate with private and governmental biomedical research facilities within the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) take account of the special needs of the poor people of developing countries in the determination of research priorities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make extensive use of field testing to adapt basic research to local conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to study the complex factors affecting population growth in developing countries and to identify factors which might motivate people to plan family size or to space their children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on use of funds for performance or research respecting abortions or involuntary sterilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilizations as a method of family planning or to coerce or provide any financial incentive to any person to undergo sterilizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for any biomedical research which relates, in whole or in part, to methods of, or the performance of, abortions or involuntary sterilization as a means of family planning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $205,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $180,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds appropriated under this subsection are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States and the Western World.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in the developing world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the World Health Organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of tuberculosis-related illnesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) one-third of the world's total population is infected with tuberculosis; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of children becoming orphans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, its international persistence and growth pose a direct public health threat to those nations that had previously largely controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the United States attributable to foreign-born persons, tuberculosis will never be controlled in the United States until it is controlled abroad.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by several barriers, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in screening, detecting, and treating the disease;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:483 --><p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the unique circumstances in each country, which requires the development and implementation of country-specific programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the risk of having a bad tuberculosis program, which is worse than having no tuberculosis program because it would significantly increase the risk of the development of more widespread drug-resistant strains of the disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by the disease.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151d. Development of indigenous energy resources</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Congress finds that energy development and production are vital elements in the development process, that energy shortages in developing countries severely limit the development process in such countries, that two-thirds of the developing countries which import oil depend on it for at least 90 percent of the energy which their economies require, and that the dramatic increase in world oil prices since 1973 has resulted in considerable economic hardship for many developing countries. The Congress is concerned that the value and purpose of much of the assistance provided to developing countries under sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title are undermined by the inability of many developing countries to satisfy their energy requirements. Unless the energy deficit of the developing countries can be narrowed by more fully exploiting indigenous sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, and coal, scarce foreign exchange will increasingly have to be diverted to oil imports, primarily to the detriment of long-term development and economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Congress recognizes that many developing countries lack access to the financial resources and technology necessary to locate, explore, and develop indigenous energy resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Congress declares that there is potential for at least a moderate increase by 1990 in the production of energy for commercial use in the developing countries which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In addition, there is a compelling need for vigorous efforts to improve the available data on the location, scale, and commercial exploitability of potential oil, natural gas, and <!-- PDFPage:489 -->coal reserves in developing countries, especially those which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Congress further declares that there are many benefits to be gained by the developing countries and by the United States and other developed countries through expanded efforts to expedite the location, exploration, and development of potential sources of energy in developing countries. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The world's energy supply would be increased and the fear of abrupt depletion would be lessened with new energy production. This could have a positive impact upon energy prices in international markets as well as a positive effect upon the balance of payments problems of many developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Diversification of the world's supplies of energy from fossil fuels would make all countries, developing and developed, less susceptible to supply interruptions and arbitrary production and pricing policies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Even a moderate increase in energy production in the developing countries would improve their ability to expand commercial trade, foreign investment, and technology transfer possibilities with the United States and other developed countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Assistance for the production of energy from indigenous resources, as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, would be of direct benefit to the poor in developing countries because of the overwhelming impact of imported energy costs upon the lives of the poor and their ability to participate in development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress also finds that energy production from renewable, decentralized sources and energy conservation are vital elements in the development process. Inadequate access by the poor to energy sources as well as the prospect of depleted fossil fuel reserves and higher energy prices require an enhanced effort to expand the energy resources of developing countries through greater emphasis on renewable sources. Renewable and decentralized energy technologies have particular applicability for the poor, especially in rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General assistance authority; cooperative programs in energy production and conservation; program goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to help developing countries alleviate their energy problems by improving their ability to use indigenous energy resources to produce the energy needed by their economies, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, to enable such countries to prepare for and undertake development of their energy resources. Such assistance may include data collection and analysis, the training of skilled personnel, research on and development of suitable energy sources, and pilot projects to test new methods of energy production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to furnish assistance under this part for cooperative programs with developing countries in energy production and conservation, through research on and development and use of small-scale, decentralized, renewable energy sources for rural areas carried out as integral parts of rural development efforts in accordance with section 2151a of this title. Such programs shall also be directed toward the earliest practicable development and use of energy technologies which are environmentally acceptable, require minimum capital investment, are most acceptable to and affordable by the people using them, are simple and inexpensive to use and maintain, and are transferable from one region of the world to another. Such programs may include research on and the development, demonstration, and application of suitable energy technologies (including use of wood); analysis of energy uses, needs, and resources; training and institutional development; and scientific interchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative coordination of planning and implementation of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter and the Department of Energy shall coordinate with one another, to the maximum extent possible, the planning and implementation of energy programs under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance for programs of technical cooperation and development, research, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for the following activities, to the extent that such activities are not authorized by sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) programs of technical cooperation and development, particularly the development efforts of United States private and voluntary agencies and regional and international development organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) programs of research into, and evaluation of, the process of economic development in less developed countries and areas, into the factors affecting the relative success and costs of development activities, and into the means, techniques, and such other aspects of development assistance as the President may determine in order to render such assistance of increasing value and benefit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) programs of reconstruction following natural or manmade disasters and programs of disaster preparedness, including the prediction of and contingency planning for natural disasters abroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) programs designed to help solve special development problems in the poorest countries and to make possible proper utilization of infrastructure and related projects funded with earlier United States assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) programs of urban development, with particular emphasis on small, labor intensive enterprises, marketing systems for small producers, and financial and other institutions which enable the urban poor to participate in the economic and social development of their country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $207,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $207,000,000 for fiscal year 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:490 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Financing cooperative projects among United States, Israel, and developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated to carry out this part, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 shall be used to finance cooperative projects among the United States, Israel, and developing countries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that if current trends in the degradation of natural resources in developing countries continue, they will severely undermine the best efforts to meet basic human needs, to achieve sustained economic growth, and to prevent international tension and conflict. The Congress also finds that the world faces enormous, urgent, and complex problems, with respect to natural resources, which require new forms of cooperation between the United States and developing countries to prevent such problems from becoming unmanageable. It is, therefore, in the economic and security interest of the United States to provide leadership both in thoroughly reassessing policies relating to natural resources and the environment, and in cooperating extensively with developing countries in order to achieve environmentally sound development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance authority and emphasis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to address the serious problems described in subsection (a) of this section, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter for developing and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to protect and manage their environment and natural resources. Special efforts shall be made to maintain and where possible to restore the land, vegetation, water, wildlife, and other resources upon which depend economic growth and human well-being, especially of the poor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation considerations applicable to programs and projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President, in implementing programs and projects under this part and part X of this subchapter, shall take fully into account the impact of such programs and projects upon the environment and natural resources of developing countries. Subject to such procedures as the President considers appropriate, the President shall require all agencies and officials responsible for programs or projects under this part and part X of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental impact statement for any program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any country, the environment of the United States, or other aspects of the environment which the President may specify; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental assessment of any proposed program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of any foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such agencies and officials should, where appropriate, use local technical resources in preparing environmental impact statements and environmental assessments pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President may establish exceptions from the requirements of this subsection for emergency conditions and for cases in which compliance with those requirements would be seriously detrimental to the foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Importance of forests and tree cover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In enacting section 2151a(b)(3) of this title the Congress recognized the importance of forests and tree cover to the developing countries. The Congress is particularly concerned about the continuing and accelerating alteration, destruction, and loss of tropical forests in developing countries, which pose a serious threat to development and the environment. Tropical forest destruction and loss&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) result in shortages of wood, especially wood for fuel; loss of biologically productive wetlands; siltation of lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation systems; floods; destruction of indigenous peoples; extinction of plant and animal species; reduced capacity for food production; and loss of genetic resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) can result in desertification and destabilization of the earth's climate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Properly managed tropical forests provide a sustained flow of resources essential to the economic growth of developing countries, as well as genetic resources of value to developed and developing countries alike.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in seeking opportunities to coordinate public and private development and investment activities which affect forests in developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance to developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing assistance to developing countries, the President shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Place a high priority on conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which stress the importance of conserving and sustainably managing forest resources for the long-term economic benefit of those countries, as well as the irreversible losses associated with forest destruction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to deforestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and activities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which offer employment and income alternatives to those who otherwise would cause destruction and loss of forests, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which help developing countries identify and implement alternatives to colonizing forested areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the fullest extent feasible, support training programs, educational efforts, and the establishment or strengthening of institutions which increase the capacity of developing countries to formulate forest policies, engage in relevant land-use planning, and otherwise improve the management of their forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To the fullest extent feasible, help end destructive slash-and-burn agriculture by supporting stable and productive farming practices in areas already cleared or degraded and on lands which inevitably will be settled, with special emphasis on demonstrating the feasibility of agroforestry and other techniques which use technologies and methods suited to the local environment and traditional agricultural techniques and feature close consultation with and involvement of local people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To the fullest extent feasible, help conserve forests which have not yet been degraded, by helping to increase production on lands already cleared or degraded through support of reforestation, fuelwood, and other sustainable forestry projects and practices, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and other activities to conserve forested watersheds and rehabilitate those which have been deforested, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:502 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To the fullest extent feasible, support training, research, and other actions which lead to sustainable and more environmentally sound practices for timber harvesting, removal, and processing, including reforestation, soil conservation, and other activities to rehabilitate degraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the fullest extent feasible, support research to expand knowledge of tropical forests and identify alternatives which will prevent forest destruction, loss, or degradation, including research in agroforestry, sustainable management of natural forests, small-scale farms and gardens, small-scale animal husbandry, wider application of adopted traditional practices, and suitable crops and crop combinations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) To the fullest extent feasible, conserve biological diversity in forest areas by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) supporting and cooperating with United States Government agencies, other donors (both bilateral and multilateral), and other appropriate governmental, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental organizations in efforts to identify, establish, and maintain a representative network of protected tropical forest ecosystems on a worldwide basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whenever appropriate, making the establishment of protected areas a condition of support for activities involving forest clearance or degradation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) helping developing countries identify tropical forest ecosystems and species in need of protection and establish and maintain appropriate protected areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in efforts to increase the awareness of United States Government agencies and other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, of the immediate and long-term value of tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) To the fullest extent feasible, utilize the resources and abilities of all relevant United States Government agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Require that any program or project under this part significantly affecting tropical forests (including projects involving the planting of exotic plant species)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be based upon careful analysis of the alternatives available to achieve the best sustainable use of the land, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take full account of the environmental impacts of the proposed activities on biological diversity,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as provided for in the environmental procedures of the Agency for International Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Deny assistance under this part for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the procurement or use of logging equipment, unless an environmental assessment indicates that all timber harvesting operations involved will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which minimizes forest destruction and that the proposed activity will produce positive economic benefits and sustainable forest management systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) actions which significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas which contain tropical forests or introduce exotic plants or animals into such areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Deny assistance under this part for the following activities unless an environmental assessment indicates that the proposed activity will contribute significantly and directly to improving the livelihood of the rural poor and will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which supports sustainable development:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Activities which would result in the conversion of forest lands to the rearing of livestock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The construction, upgrading, or maintenance of roads (including temporary haul roads for logging or other extractive industries) which pass through relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The colonization of forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The construction of dams or other water control structures which flood relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the survival of many animal and plant species is endangered by over-hunting, by the presence of toxic chemicals in water, air and soil, and by the destruction of habitats. The Congress further finds that the extinction of animal and plant species is an irreparable loss with potentially serious environmental and economic consequences for develop<!-- PDFPage:503 -->ing and developed countries alike. Accordingly, the preservation of animal and plant species through the regulation of the hunting and trade in endangered species, through limitations on the pollution of natural ecosystems, and through the protection of wildlife habitats should be an important objective of the United States development assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Remedial measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to preserve biological diversity, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter, notwithstanding section 2420 of this title, to assist countries in protecting and maintaining wildlife habitats and in developing sound wildlife management and plant conservation programs. Special efforts should be made to establish and maintain wildlife sanctuaries, reserves, and parks; to enact and enforce anti-poaching measures; and to identify, study, and catalog animal and plant species, especially in tropical environments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funding level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,500,000 of the funds available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter (excluding funds made available to carry out section 2151b(c)(2) of this title, relating to the Child Survival Fund) shall be allocated for assistance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for activities which were not funded prior to fiscal year 1987. In addition, the Agency for International Development shall, to the fullest extent possible, continue and increase assistance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for activities for which assistance was provided in fiscal years prior to fiscal year 1987.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Country analysis requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each country development strategy statement or other country plan prepared by the Agency for International Development shall include an analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the actions necessary in that country to conserve biological diversity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which the actions proposed for support by the Agency meet the needs thus identified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Local involvement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the fullest extent possible, projects supported under this section shall include close consultation with and involvement of local people at all stages of design and implementation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever feasible, the objectives of this section shall be accomplished through projects managed by appropriate private and voluntary organizations, or international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations, which are active in the region or country where the project is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Actions by AID</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cooperate with appropriate international organizations, both governmental and nongovernmental;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) look to the World Conservation Strategy as an overall guide for actions to conserve biological diversity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries which stress the importance of conserving biological diversity for the long-term economic benefit of those countries and which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to loss of biological diversity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) support training and education efforts which improve the capacity of recipient countries to prevent loss of biological diversity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whenever possible, enter into long-term agreements in which the recipient country agrees to protect ecosystems or other wildlife habitats recommended for protection by relevant governmental or nongovernmental organizations or as a result of activities undertaken pursuant to paragraph (6), and the United States agrees to provide, subject to obtaining the necessary appropriations, additional assistance necessary for the establishment and maintenance of such protected areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) support, as necessary and in cooperation with the appropriate governmental and nongovernmental organizations, efforts to identify and survey ecosystems in recipient countries worthy of protection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) cooperate with and support the relevant efforts of other agencies of the United States Government, including the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the Forest Service, and the Peace Corps;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) review the Agency's environmental regulations and revise them as necessary to ensure that ongoing and proposed actions by the Agency do not inadvertently endanger wildlife species or their critical habitats, harm protected areas, or have other adverse impacts on biological diversity (and shall report to the Congress within a year after October 24, 1986, on the actions taken pursuant to this paragraph);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) ensure that environmental profiles sponsored by the Agency include information needed for conservation of biological diversity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) deny any direct or indirect assistance under this part for actions which significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas or introduce exotic plants or animals into such areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Annual reports</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151u. Private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives in overseas development</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional finding of importance of participation by private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the participation of rural and urban poor people in their countries&rsquo; development can be assisted and accelerated in an effective manner through an increase in activities planned and carried out by private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives. Such organizations and cooperatives, embodying the American spirit of self-help and assistance to others to improve their lives and incomes, constitute an important means of mobilizing private American financial and human resources to benefit poor people in developing countries. The Congress declares that it is in the interest of the United States that such organizations and cooperatives expand their overseas development efforts without compromising their private and independent nature. The Congress further declares that the financial resources of such organizations and cooperatives should be supplemented by the contribution of public funds for the purpose of undertaking development activities in accordance with the principles set forth in section 2151&ndash;1 of this title and, if necessary and determined on a case-by-case basis, for the purpose of sharing the cost of developing programs related to such activities. The Congress urges the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, in implementing programs authorized under subchapter I of this chapter, to draw on the resource of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives to plan and carry out development activities and to establish simplified procedures for the development and approval of programs to be carried out by such private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives as have demonstrated a capacity to undertake effective development activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of transportation charges on shipments by American National Red Cross and United States voluntary agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to further the efficient use of United States voluntary contributions for development, relief, and rehabilitation of friendly peoples, the President is authorized to use funds made available for the purposes of this part and part X of this subchapter to pay transportation charges on shipments by the American National Red Cross and by United States voluntary agencies registered with the Agency for International Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reimbursement for transportation charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursement under this section may be provided for transportation charges on shipments from United States ports, or in the case of excess or surplus property supplied by the United States from foreign ports, to ports of entry abroad or to points of entry abroad in cases (1) of landlocked countries, (2) where ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disturbances, (3) where carriers to a specified country are unavailable, or (4) where a substantial savings in costs or time can be effected by the utilization of points of entry other than ports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Arrangements with receiving country for free entry of shipments and for availability of local currency to defray transportation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where practicable, the President shall make arrangements with the receiving country for free entry of such shipments and for the making available by the country of local currencies for the purpose of defraying the transportation costs of such shipments from the port or point of entry of the receiving country to the designated shipping point of the consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuation of support for programs in countries antedating prohibitions on assistance; national interest considerations; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prohibitions on assistance to countries contained in this chapter or any other Act shall not be construed to prohibit assistance by the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter in support of programs of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives already being supported prior to the date such prohibition becomes applicable. The President shall take into consideration, in any case in which statutory prohibitions on assistance would be applicable but for this subsection, whether continuation of support for such programs is in the national interest of the United States. If the President continues such support after such date, he shall prepare and transmit, not later than one year after such date, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report setting forth the reasons for such continuation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funds for private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1989, funds in an amount not less than thirteen and one half percent of the aggregate amount appropriated for that fiscal year to carry out sections 2151a(a), 2151b(b), 2151b(c), 2151c, 2151d, 2151s,<sup><a href="#2151u_1_target" name="2151u_1">1</a></sup> and 2292 of this title shall be made available for the activities of private and voluntary organizations, and the President shall seek to channel funds in an amount not less than 16 percent of such aggregate amount for the activities of private and voluntary organizations. Funds made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter for the activities of private and voluntary organizations may be considered in determining compliance with the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Promotion of democratic cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that, in addition to their role in social and economic development, cooperatives provide an opportunity for people to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Therefore, assistance under this part shall be provided to rural and urban cooperatives which offer large numbers of low- and middle-income people in developing countries an opportunity to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Such assistance shall be designed to encourage the adoption of self-help, private sector cooperative techniques and practices which have been successful in the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151v. Aid to relatively least developed countries</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Characterization of least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Relatively least developed countries (as determined on the basis of criteria comparable to those used for the United Nations General Assembly list of &ldquo;least developed countries&rdquo;) are characterized by extreme poverty, very limited infrastructure, and limited administrative capacity to implement basic human needs growth strategies. In such countries special measures may be necessary to insure the full effectiveness of assistance furnished under subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance on grant basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of promoting economic growth in these countries, the President is authorized and encouraged to make assistance under this part available on a grant basis to the maximum extent that is consistent with the attainment of United States development objectives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of principal and interest on prior liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress recognizes that the relatively least developed countries have virtually no access to private international capital markets. Insofar as possible, prior assistance terms should be consistent with present grant assistance terms for relatively least developed countries. Therefore, notwithstanding section 2370(r) of this title and section 321 of the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975 but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the President on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of the country for financial resources and the commitment of the country to the development objectives set forth in sections 2151 and 2151&ndash;1 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may permit a relatively least developed country to place amounts, which would otherwise be paid to the United States as payments on principal or interest on liability incurred by that country under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) into local currency accounts (in equivalent amounts of local currencies as determined by the official exchange rate for United States dollars) for use by the relatively least developed country, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, for activities which are consistent with section 2151&ndash;1 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may waive interest payments on liability incurred by a relatively least developed country under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) if the President determines that that country would be unable to use for development purposes the equivalent amounts of local currencies which could be made available under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The aggregate amount of interest waived and interest and principal paid into local currency accounts under this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed the amount approved for such purpose in an Act appropriating funds to carry out this part for that fiscal year, which <!-- PDFPage:509 -->amount may not exceed the amount authorized to be so approved by the annual authorizing legislation for development assistance programs. Amounts due and payable during fiscal year 1981 to the United States from relatively least developed countries on loans made under this subchapter (or any predecessor legislation) are authorized to be approved for use, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in an amount not to exceed $10,845,000.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The American people abhor torture by any government or person. The existence of torture creates a climate of fear and international insecurity that affects all people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Torture is the deliberate mental and physical damage caused by governments to individuals to destroy individual personality and terrorize society. The effects of torture are long term. Those effects <!-- PDFPage:515 -->can last a lifetime for the survivors and affect future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) By eliminating the leadership of their opposition and frightening the general public, repressive governments often use torture as a weapon against democracy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Torture survivors remain under physical and psychological threats, especially in communities where the perpetrators are not brought to justice. In many nations, even those who treat torture survivors are threatened with reprisals, including torture, for carrying out their ethical duty to provide care. Both the survivors of torture and their treatment providers should be accorded protection from further repression.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering the United States have been victims of torture. Those claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of their applications for political asylum to minimize their insecurity and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now live in the United States. They should be provided with the rehabilitation services which would enable them to become productive members of our communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and other acts of torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers, together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect their families, the United States can help to heal the effects of torture and prevent its use around the world.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. DEFINITION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;As used in this Act, the term &lsquo;torture&rsquo; has the meaning given the term in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, and includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence by a person acting under the color of law upon another person under his custody or physical control.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Widespread corruption endangers the stability and security of societies, undermines democracy, and jeopardizes the social, political, and economic development of a society.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Corruption facilitates criminal activities, such as money laundering, hinders economic development, inflates the costs of doing business, and undermines the legitimacy of the government and public trust.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In January 1997 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution urging member states to carefully consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States was the first country to criminalize international bribery through the enactment of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 [Pub. L. 95&ndash;213, title I, see Tables for classification] and United States leadership was instrumental in the passage of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Vice President, at the Global Forum on Fighting Corruption in 1999, declared corruption to be a direct threat to the rule of law and the Secretary of State declared corruption to be a matter of profound political and social consequence for our efforts to strengthen democratic governments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Secretary of State, at the Inter-American Development Bank's annual meeting in March 2000, declared that despite certain economic achievements, democracy is being threatened as citizens grow weary of the corruption and favoritism of their official institutions and that efforts must be made to improve governance if respect for democratic institutions is to be regained.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In May 1996 the Organization of American States (OAS) adopted the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption requiring countries to provide various forms of international cooperation and assistance to facilitate the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of acts of corruption.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Independent media, committed to fighting corruption and trained in investigative journalism techniques, can both educate the public on the costs of corruption and act as a deterrent against corrupt officials.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Competent and independent judiciary, founded on a merit-based selection process and trained to enforce contracts and protect property rights, is critical for creating a predictable and consistent environment for transparency in legal procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Independent and accountable legislatures, responsive political parties, and transparent electoral processes, in conjunction with professional, accountable, and transparent financial management and procurement policies and procedures, are essential to the promotion of good governance and to the combat of corruption.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Transparent business frameworks, including modern commercial codes and intellectual property <!-- PDFPage:518 -->rights, are vital to enhancing economic growth and decreasing corruption at all levels of society.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The United States should attempt to improve accountability in foreign countries, including by&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title] is to ensure that United States assistance programs promote good governance by assisting other countries to combat corruption throughout society and to improve transparency and accountability at all levels of government and throughout the private sector.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There are more than 143,000,000 orphans living&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2152f_1_target" name="2152f_1">1</a></sup> sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children have lost both parents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. The pandemic is deepening poverty in entire communities, and is jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected countries. It is estimated that 14,000,000 children have lost one or both parents to AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for human welfare, development, and political stability that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Extended families and local communities are struggling to meet the basic needs of orphans and vulnerable children by providing food, health care including treatment of children living with HIV/AIDS, education expenses, and clothing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Famines, natural disasters, chronic poverty, ongoing conflicts, and civil wars in developing countries are adversely affecting children in these countries, the vast majority of whom currently do not receive humanitarian assistance or other support from the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The United States Government administers various assistance programs for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. In order to improve targeting and programming of resources, the United States Agency for International Development should develop methods to adequately track the overall number of orphans and other vulnerable children receiving assistance, the kinds of programs for such children by sector and location, and any other such related data and analysis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The United States Agency for International Development should improve its capabilities to deliver assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries through partnerships with private volunteer organizations, including community and faith-based organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The United States Agency for International Development should be the primary United States Government agency responsible for identifying and assisting orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Providing assistance to such children is an important expression of the humanitarian concern and tradition of the people of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;95, &sect;2, Nov. 8, 2005, 119 Stat. 2111, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) As of July 2004, there were more than 143,000,000 children living in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean who were identified as orphans, having lost one or both of their parents. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children were identified as double orphans, having lost both parents&mdash;the vast majority of whom died of AIDS. These children often are disadvantaged in numerous and devastating ways and most households with orphans cannot meet the basic needs of health care, food, clothing, and educational expenses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) It is estimated that 121,000,000 children worldwide do not attend school and that the majority of such children are young girls. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), orphans are less likely to be in school and more likely to be working full time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) School food programs, including take-home rations, in developing countries provide strong incentives for children to remain in school and continue their education. School food programs can reduce short-term hunger, improve cognitive functions, and enhance learning, behavior, and achievement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Financial barriers, such as school fees and other costs of education, prevent many orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries from attending school. Providing children with free primary school education, while simultaneously ensuring that adequate resources exist for teacher training and infrastructure, would help more orphans and other vulnerable children obtain a quality education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The trauma that results from the loss of a parent can trigger behavior problems of aggression or emotional withdrawal and negatively affect a child's performance in school and the child's social relations. Children living in families affected by HIV/AIDS or who have been orphaned by AIDS often face stigmatization and discrimination. Providing culturally appropriate psychosocial support to such children can assist them in successfully accepting and adjusting to their circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries routinely are denied their inheritance or encounter difficulties in claiming the land and other property which they have inherited. Even when the inheritance rights of women and children are spelled out in law, such rights are difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many countries it is difficult or impossible for a widow, even if she has young children, to claim property after the death of her husband.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating affect on children and is deepening poverty in entire communities and jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased the number of orphans worldwide and has exacerbated the poor living conditions of the world's poorest and most vulnerable children. AIDS has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. An estimated 14,000,000 orphans have lost 1 or both parents to AIDS. By 2010, it is estimated that over 25,000,000 children will have been orphaned by AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Approximately 2,500,000 children under the age of 15 worldwide have HIV/AIDS. Every day another 2,000 children under the age of 15 are infected with HIV. Without treatment, most children born with HIV can expect to die by age two, but with sustained drug treatment through childhood, the chances of long-term survival and a productive adulthood improve dramatically.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Few international development programs specifically target the treatment of children with HIV/AIDS in developing countries. Reasons for this include the perceived low priority of pediatric treatment, a lack of pediatric health care professionals, lack of expertise and experience in pediatric drug dosing and monitoring, the perceived complexity of pediatric treatment, and mistaken beliefs regarding the risks and benefits of pediatric treatment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Although a number of organizations seek to meet the needs of orphans or other vulnerable children, extended families and local communities continue to be the primary providers of support for such children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The HIV/AIDS pandemic is placing huge burdens on communities and is leaving many orphans with little support. Alternatives to traditional orphanages, such as community-based resource centers, continue to evolve in response to the massive number of orphans that has resulted from the pandemic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for political stability, human welfare, and development that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide, and this crisis requires an accelerated response from the international community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Although section 403(b) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(b)) establishes the requirement that not less than 10 percent of amounts appropriated for HIV/AIDS assistance for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2008 shall be expended for assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS, there is an urgent need to provide assistance to such children prior to 2006.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) Numerous United States and indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. Many of these organizations have submitted applications for grants to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to provide increased levels of assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Increasing the amount of assistance that is provided by the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development through United States and indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, will <!-- PDFPage:522 -->provide greater protection for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) It is essential that the United States Government adopt a comprehensive approach for the provision of assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. A comprehensive approach would ensure that important services, such as basic care, psychosocial support, school food programs, increased educational opportunities and employment training and related services, the protection and promotion of inheritance rights for such children, and the treatment of orphans and other vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS, are made more accessible.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children can best be provided by a comprehensive approach of the United States Government that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) ensures that Federal agencies and the private sector coordinate efforts to prevent and eliminate duplication of efforts and waste in the provision of such assistance; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to the maximum extent possible, focuses on community-based programs that allow orphans and other vulnerable children to remain connected to the traditions and rituals of their families and communities.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;121, Dec. 1, 2005, 119 Stat. 2533, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Water-related diseases are a human tragedy, killing up to five million people annually, preventing millions of people from leading healthy lives, and undermining development efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A child dies an average of every 15 seconds because of lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the poorest countries in the world, one out of five children dies from a preventable, water-related disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices are directly responsible for the vast majority of diarrheal diseases which kill over two million children each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) At any given time, half of all people in the developing world are suffering from one or more of the main diseases associated with inadequate provision of water supply and sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Over 1.1 billion people, one in every six people in the world, lack access to safe drinking water.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Nearly 2.6 billion people, two in every five people in the world, lack access to basic sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Half of all schools in the world do not have access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Over the past 20 years, two billion people have gained access to safe drinking water and 600 million people have gained access to basic sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Access to safe water and sanitation and improved hygiene are significant factors in controlling the spread of disease in the developing world and positively affecting worker productivity and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Increasing access to safe water and sanitation advances efforts toward other development objectives, such as fighting poverty and hunger, promoting primary education and gender equality, reducing child mortality, promoting environmental stability, improving the lives of slum dwellers, and strengthening national security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Providing safe supplies of water and sanitation and hygiene improvements would save millions of lives by reducing the prevalence of water-borne diseases, water-based diseases, water-privation diseases, and water-related vector diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Because women and girls in developing countries are often the carriers of water, lack of access to safe water and sanitation disproportionately affects <!-- PDFPage:524 -->women and limits women's opportunities at education, livelihood, and financial independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Between 20 percent and 50 percent of existing water systems in developing countries are not operating or are operating poorly.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) In developing world water delivery systems, an average of 50 percent of all water is lost before it gets to the end-user.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Every $1 invested in safe water and sanitation would yield an economic return of between $3 and $34, depending on the region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Developing sustainable financing mechanisms, such as pooling mechanisms and revolving funds, is necessary for the long-term viability of improved water and sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) The annual level of investment needed to meet the water and sanitation needs of developing countries far exceeds the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and spending by governments of developing countries, so facilitating and attracting greater public and private investment is essential.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) Meeting the water and sanitation needs of the lowest-income developing countries will require an increase in the resources available as grants from donor countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) The long-term sustainability of improved water and sanitation services can be advanced by promoting community level action and engagement with civil society.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) Target 10 of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals is to reduce by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) The participants in the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, including the United States, agreed to the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development which included an agreement to work to reduce by one-half &lsquo;the proportion of people who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation&rsquo; by 2015.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the United States announced the Water for the Poor Initiative, committing $970 million for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 to improve sustainable management of fresh water resources and accelerate and expand international efforts to achieve the goal of cutting in half by 2015 the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/217 (February 9, 2004) proclaimed &lsquo;the period from 2005 to 2015 the International Decade for Action, &ldquo;Water for Life&rdquo;, to commence on World Water Day, 22 March 2005&rsquo; for the purpose of increasing the focus of the international community on water-related issues at all levels and on the implementation of water-related programs and projects.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Around the world, 263 river basins are shared by two or more countries, and many more basins and watersheds cross political or ethnic boundaries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(26) Water scarcity can contribute to insecurity and conflict on subnational, national, and international levels, thus endangering the national security of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(27) Opportunities to manage water problems can be leveraged in ways to build confidence, trust, and peace between parties in conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(28) Cooperative water management can help resolve conflicts caused by other problems and is often a crucial component in resolving such conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(29) Cooperative water management can help countries recover from conflict and, by promoting dialogue and cooperation among former parties in conflict, can help prevent the reemergence of conflict.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to increase the percentage of water and sanitation assistance targeted toward countries designated as high priority countries under section 6(f) of this Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to ensure that water and sanitation assistance reflect an appropriate balance of grants, loans, contracts, investment insurance, loan guarantees, and other assistance to further ensure affordability and equity in the provision of access to safe water and sanitation for the very poor;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to ensure that the targeting of water and sanitation assistance reflect an appropriate balance between urban, periurban, and rural areas to meet the purposes of assistance described in section 135 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [this section], as added by section 5(a) of this Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure that forms of water and sanitation assistance provided reflect the level of existing resources and markets for investment in water and sanitation within recipient countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to ensure that water and sanitation assistance, to the extent possible, supports the poverty reduction strategies of recipient countries and, when appropriate, encourages the inclusion of water and sanitation within such poverty reduction strategies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to promote country and local ownership of safe water and sanitation programs, to the extent appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to promote community-based approaches in the provision of affordable and equitable access to safe water and sanitation, including the involvement of civil society;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to mobilize and leverage the financial and technical capacity of businesses, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society in the form of public-private alliances;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to encourage reforms and increase the capacity of foreign governments to formulate and implement policies that expand access to safe water and sanitation in an affordable, equitable, and sustainable manner, including integrated strategic planning; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that the planning and administration of development assistance by, or under the sponsorship of the United Nations, multilateral lending institutions, and other multilateral organizations may contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of that assistance through participation of other donors in the development effort, improved coordination of policies and programs, pooling of knowledge, avoidance of duplication of facilities and manpower, and greater encouragement of self-help performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regional programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further the sense of the Congress (1) that where problems or opportunities are common to two or more countries in a region, in such fields as agriculture, education, transportation, communications, power, watershed development, disease control, and establishment of development banks, these countries often can more effectively resolve such problems and exploit such opportunities by joining together in regional organizations or working together on regional programs, (2) that assistance often can be utilized more efficiently in regional programs than in separate country programs, and (3) that to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this chapter assistance under this chapter should be furnished so as to encourage less developed countries to cooperate with each other in regional development programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federal funds to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations for loans to foreign countries; increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should increase, to the extent practicable, the funds provided by the United States to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations in which the United States participates for use by such institutions and organizations in making loans to foreign countries.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 93&ndash;559, &sect;55(a), Dec. 30, 1974, 88 Stat. 1819, provided that: &ldquo;The United Nations has designated thirty-two countries as &lsquo;Most Seriously Affected&rsquo; by the current economic crisis. These are countries without the internal food production capability or the foreign exchange availability to secure food to meet their immediate food requirements. The Congress calls upon the President and Secretary of State to take the following actions designed to mobilize appropriate resources to meet the food emergency:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Review and make appropriate adjustments in the level of programming of our food and fertilizer assistance programs with the aim of increasing to the maximum extent feasible the volume of food and fertilizer available to those countries most seriously affected by current food shortages.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Call upon all traditional and potential new donors of food, fertilizer, or the means of financing these commodities to immediately increase their participation in efforts to address the emergency food needs of the developing world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Make available to these most seriously affected countries the maximum feasible volume of food commodities, with appropriate regard to the current domestic price and supply situations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Maintain regular and full consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress and report to the Congress and the Nation on steps which are being taken to help meet this food emergency. In accordance with this provision, the President shall report to the Congress on a global assessment of food needs for fiscal year 1975, specifying expected food grain deficits and currently planned programming of food assistance, and steps which are being taken to encourage other countries to increase their participation in food assistance or the financing of food assistance. Such report should reach the Congress promptly and should be supplemented quarterly for the remainder of fiscal year 1975.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Congress directs that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, not more than 30 percent of concessional food aid should be allocated to countries other than those which are most seriously affected by current food shortages, unless the President demonstrates to the appropriate Committees of the Congress that the use of such food assistance is solely for humanitarian food purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Congress calls upon the President to proceed with the implementation of resolutions and recommendations adopted by the World Food Conference. The Congress believes that it is incumbent upon the United States to take a leading role in assisting in the development of a viable and coherent world food policy which would begin the task of alleviating widespread hunger and suffering prevalent in famine-stricken nations. The President shall report to the Congress within 120 days of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 1974] on the implementation of the resolutions and the extent to which the United States is participating in the implementation of resolutions adopted at the World Food Conference.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2181. Policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that shelter, including essential urban development services, is among the most fundamental of human needs. Shelter for most people in the developing countries consists largely of domestic materials assembled by local labor. While recognizing that most financing for such shelter must come from domestic resources, the Congress finds that carefully designed programs involving United States capital and expertise can increase the availability of domestic financing for improved shelter and related services for low-income people by demonstrating to local entrepreneurs and institutions that providing low-cost shelter can be financially viable. The Congress reaffirms, therefore, that the United States should continue to assist developing countries in marshalling resources for low-cost shelter. Particular attention should be given to programs which will support pilot projects for low-cost shelter or which will have a maximum demonstration impact on local institutions and national policy. The Congress declares that the long run goal of all such programs should be to develop domestic construction capabilities and to stimulate local credit institutions to make available domestic capital and other management and technological resources required for effective low-cost shelter programs and policies.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Fees; determination by President; reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fee shall be charged for each guaranty issued under section 2182 or 2182a of this title in an amount to be determined by the President.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Accumulated and existing fees; expenditure of fees; revolving fund account; investments; use of investment income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of $50,000,000 of fees accumulated under prior investment guaranty provisions repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, together with all fees collected in connection with guaranties issued under section 2182 of this title or under prior housing guaranty authorities, shall be available for meeting necessary administrative and operating expenses of carrying out the provisions of section 2182 of this title and administering housing guaranties heretofore authorized under this subpart and under prior housing guaranty provisions repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 (including, but not limited to expenses pertaining to personnel, supplies, and printing), subject to such limitations as may be imposed in annual appropriation Acts; for meeting management and custodial costs incurred with respect to currencies or other assets acquired under guaranties made pursuant to section 2182 of this title or heretofore pursuant to this subpart or prior Latin American and other housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969; and to pay the cost of investigating and adjusting (including costs of arbitration) claims under such guaranties; and shall be available for expenditure in discharge of liabilities under such guaranties until such time as all such property has been disposed of and all such liabilities have been discharged or have expired, or until all such fees have been expended in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Fees collected in connection with guaranties issued under section 2182a of this title shall likewise be available to meet similar expenses, costs, or liabilities incurred in connection with the programs authorized by that section. All of the foregoing fees referred to in this section together with earnings thereon and other income arising from guaranty operations under this subpart shall be held in a revolving fund account maintained in the Treasury of the United States. All funds in such account may be in<!-- PDFPage:535 -->vested in obligations of the United States. Any interest or other receipts derived from such investments shall be credited to such account and may be used for the purposes cited in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priorities of funds for guaranty payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under section 2182 of this title or heretofore under this subpart or under prior Latin American or other housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, shall be paid first out of fees referred to in subsection (b) of this section (excluding amounts required for purposes other than the discharge of liabilities under guaranties) as long as such fees are available, and thereafter shall be paid out of funds, if any, realized from the sale of currencies or other assets acquired in connection with any payment made to discharge liabilities under such guaranties as long as funds are available, and finally out of funds hereafter made available pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guaranties as obligations backed by full faith and credit of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All guaranties issued under section 2182 or 2182a, or previously under section 2200 of this title or heretofore under this subpart or under prior Latin American or other housing guaranty authority repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 shall constitute obligations, in accordance with the terms of such guaranties, of the United States of America and the full faith and credit of the United States of America is hereby pledged for the full payment and performance of such obligations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations; borrowing authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the President such amounts, to remain available until expended, as may be necessary from time to time to carry out the purposes of this subpart.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to meet obligations incurred for the payment of claims pursuant to loan guaranties described in subsection (d) of this section, the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter may, to the extent that reserves are not sufficient, borrow from time to time from the Treasury, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Administrator may exercise the authority to borrow under this paragraph only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount borrowed under this paragraph which is outstanding at any one time may not exceed $100,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any such borrowing shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into account the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make loans under this paragraph and for such purpose may borrow on the credit of the United States in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 31 of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agency determination of maximum rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any loan investment guaranteed under section 2182 of this title, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall prescribe the maximum rate of interest allowable to the eligible investor, which maximum rate shall not exceed by more than 1 per centum the then current rate of interest applicable to housing mortgages insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The maximum allowable rate of interest under this subsection shall be prescribed by the agency as of the date the project covered by the investment is officially authorized and, prior to the execution of the contract, the agency may amend such rate at its discretion, consistent with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guaranties under prior acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Housing guaranties committed, authorized, or outstanding heretofore under this subpart or under prior housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 shall continue subject to provisions of law originally applicable thereto and fees collected hereafter with respect to such guaranties shall be available for the purposes specified in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fraud or misrepresentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment may be made under any guaranty issued pursuant to this subpart for any loss arising out of fraud or misrepresentation for which the party seeking payment is responsible.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Guaranties shall be issued under section 2182 of this title only for housing projects which are coordinated with and complementary to any development assistance being furnished under part I of this subchapter and which are specifically designed to demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of particular kinds of housing or of financial or other institutional arrangements. Of the aggregate face value of housing guaranties hereafter issued under this subpart, not less than 90 per centum shall be issued for housing suitable for families with income below the median income (below the median urban income for housing in urban areas) in the country in which the housing is located.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2186. Loan guarantees to Israel program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, during the period beginning October 1, 1992, and ending September 30, 1997, the President is authorized to issue guarantees against losses incurred in connection with loans to Israel made as a result of Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries. In the event that less than the full amount authorized to be issued under subsection (b) of this section is issued in such period, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall be available in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fiscal year levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to issue guarantees in furtherance of the purposes of this section. Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the total principal amount of guarantees which may be issued by the President under this section shall be up to $10,000,000,000 which may be issued as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in fiscal year 1993, up to $2,000,000,000 may be issued on October 1, 1992 or thereafter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subject to subsection (d) of this section, in fiscal years 1994 through 1997, up to $2,000,000,000 in each fiscal year may be issued on October 1 or thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If less than the full amount of guarantees authorized to be made available in a fiscal year pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection is issued to Israel during that fiscal year, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall extend to any subsequent fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Not later than September 1 of each year during the period in which the President is authorized to issue loan guarantees under subsection (a) of this section, beginning in fiscal year 1993, the President shall notify the appropriate congressional committees in writing of his intentions regarding the exercise of that authority for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of that year, including a statement of the total principal amount of guarantees, if any, that the President proposes to issue for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;appropriate congressional committees&rdquo; means the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:540 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Guarantees may be issued under this section only to support activities in the geographic areas which were subject to the administration of the Government of Israel before June 5, 1967.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on guarantee amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of authorized but unissued guarantees that the President is authorized to issue as specified in subsection (b) of this section shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount extended or estimated to have been extended by the Government of Israel during the previous year for activities which the President determines are inconsistent with the objectives of this section or understandings reached between the United States Government and the Government of Israel regarding the implementation of the loan program. The President shall submit a report to Congress no later than September 30 of each fiscal year during the pendency of the program specifying the amount calculated under this subsection and that will be deducted from the amount of guarantees authorized to be issued in the next fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Fees charged for the loan guarantee program under this section each year shall be an aggregate annual origination fee equal to the estimated subsidy cost of the guarantees issued under this section for that year, calculated by the Office of Management and Budget for the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]. This shall also include an amount for the administrative expenses of the Agency for International Development in administering the program under this section. All such fees shall be paid by the Government of Israel to the Government of the United States. Funds made available for Israel under part 4 of subchapter II of this chapter, may be utilized by the Government of Israel to pay such fees to the United States Government. No further appropriations of subsidy cost are needed for the loan guarantee authorized hereunder for fiscal year 1993 and the four succeeding fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The origination fee shall be payable to the United States Government on a pro rata basis as each guarantee for each loan or increment is issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authority to suspend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (<em>l</em>) and (m) of this section, the President shall determine the terms and conditions for issuing guarantees. If the President determines that these terms and conditions have been breached, the President may suspend or terminate the provision of all or part of the additional loan guarantees not yet issued under this section. Upon making such a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Procedures for suspension or termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any suspension or termination pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon making a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such a suspension or termination shall cease to be effective if Congress enacts, within 30 days of submission, a joint resolution authorizing the assistance notwithstanding the suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any such joint resolution shall be considered in the Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions under this subsection, a motion to proceed to the consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In the event that the President suspends the provision of additional loan guarantees under subsection (f) of this section and Congress does not enact a joint resolution pursuant to this subsection, the provision of additional loan guarantees under the program established by this section may be resumed only if the President determines and so reports to Congress that the reasons for the suspension have been resolved or that the resumption is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Economic context</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The effective absorption of immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia within the private sector requires large investment and economic restructuring to promote market efficiency and thereby contribute to productive employment and sustainable growth. Congress recognizes that the Government of Israel is developing an economic strategy designed to achieve these goals, and that the Government of Israel intends to adopt a comprehensive, multi-year economic strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Congress also recognizes that these policies are being designed to reduce direct involvement of the government in the economic system and to promote private enterprise, important prerequisites for economic stability and sustainable growth.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that, as agreed between the two Governments and in order to further the policies specified in subsection (h) of this section, Israel and the United States should continue to engage in consultations concerning economic and financial measures, including structural and other reforms, that Israel should undertake during the pendency of this program to enable its economy to absorb and resettle immigrants and to accommodate the increased debt burden that will result from loans guaranteed pursuant to this section. It is the sense of the Congress that these consultations on economic measures should address progress and plans in the areas of budget policies, privatiza<!-- PDFPage:541 -->tion, trade liberalization, financial and capital markets, labor markets, competition policy, and deregulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Goods and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the pendency of the loan program authorized under this section, it is anticipated that, in the context of the economic reforms undertaken pursuant to subsections (h) and (i) of this section, Israel's increased population due to its absorption of immigrants, and the liberalization by the Government of Israel of its trade policy with the United States, the amount of United States investment goods and services purchased for use in or with respect to the country of Israel will substantially increase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall report to Congress by December 31 of each fiscal year until December 31, 1999, regarding the implementation of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Applicability of certain sections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 2183 of this title shall apply to guarantees issued under subsection (a) of this section in the same manner as such section applies to guarantees issued under section 2182 of this title, except that subsections (a), (e)(1), (g), and (j) of section 2183 of this title shall not apply to such guarantees and except that, to the extent section 2183 of this title is inconsistent with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], that Act shall apply. Loans shall be guaranteed under this section without regard to sections 2181, 2182, and 2198(c) of this title. Notwithstanding section 2183(f) of this title, the interest rate for loans guaranteed under this section may include a reasonable fee to cover the costs and fees incurred by the borrower in connection with this program or financing under this section in the event the borrower elects not to finance such costs or fees out of loan principal. Guarantees once issued hereunder shall be unconditional and fully and freely transferable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each loan guarantee issued under this section shall guarantee 100 percent of the principal and interest payable on such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standard terms of any loan or increment guaranteed under this section shall be 30 years with semiannual payments of interest only over the first 10 years, and with semiannual payments of principal and interest on a level payment basis, over the last 20 years thereof, except that the guaranteed loan or any increments issued in a single transaction may include obligations having different maturities, interest rates, and payment terms if the aggregate scheduled debt service for all obligations issued in a single transaction equals the debt service for a single loan or increment of like amount having the standard terms described in this sentence. The guarantor shall not have the right to accelerate any guaranteed loan or increment or to pay any amounts in respect of the guarantees issued other than in accordance with the original payment terms of the loan. For purposes of determining the maximum principal amount of any loan or increment to be guaranteed under this section, the principal amount of each such loan or increment shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of any loan issued on a discount basis, the original issue price (excluding any transaction costs) thereof; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any loan issue&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2186_1_target" name="2186_1">1</a></sup> on an interest-bearing basis, the stated principal amount thereof.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Recognizing that major private investments in less developed friendly countries or <!-- PDFPage:547 -->areas are often made by enterprises in which there is multinational participation, including significant United States private participation, the Corporation may make arrangements with foreign governments (including agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions thereof) or with multilateral organizations and institutions for sharing liabilities assumed under investment insurance for such investments and may in connection therewith issue insurance to investors not otherwise eligible hereunder, except that liabilities assumed by the Corporation under the authority of this subsection shall be consistent with the purposes of this subpart and that the maximum share of liabilities so assumed shall not exceed the proportionate participation by eligible investors in the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not more than 10 per centum of the maximum contingent liability of investment insurance which the Corporation is permitted to have outstanding under section 2195(a)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2194_1_target" name="2194_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall be issued to a single investor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before issuing insurance for the first time for loss due to business interruption, and in each subsequent instance in which a significant expansion is proposed in the type of risk to be insured under the definition of &ldquo;civil strife&rdquo; or &ldquo;business interruption&rdquo;, the Corporation shall, at least sixty days before such insurance is issued, submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report with respect to such insurance, including a thorough analysis of the risks to be covered, anticipated losses, and proposed rates and reserves and, in the case of insurance for loss due to business interruption, an explanation of the underwriting basis upon which the insurance is to be offered. Any such report with respect to insurance for loss due to business interruption shall be considered in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications pursuant to section 2394&ndash;1 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">There shall be established in the Treasury of the United States a noncredit account revolving fund, which shall be available for discharge of liabilities, as provided in subsection (d) of this section, until such time as all such liabilities have been discharged or have expired or until all of the fund has been expended in accordance with the provisions of this section. Such fund shall be funded by: (1) the funds heretofore available to discharge liabilities under predecessor guaranty authority (including housing guaranty authorities), less both the amount made available for housing guaranty programs pursuant to section 2183(b) of this title and the amount made available to the Corporation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; and (2) such sums as shall be appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section for such purpose. Additional amounts may thereafter be transferred to such fund pursuant to section 2196 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority of funds used to discharge liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payments made to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance issued under section 2194 of this title, under similar predecessor guaranty authority, or under section 2194b of this title shall be paid first out of the noncredit account revolving fund, as long as such fund remains available, and thereafter out of funds made available pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under section 2194(b) of this title or 2194(c) of this title shall be paid in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reserves from predecessor guaranty authority</h4>

However, no appropriations shall be made to augment the noncredit account revolving fund until the amount of funds in the noncredit account revolving fund is less than $25,000,000. Any appropriations to augment the noncredit account revolving fund shall then only be made either pursuant to specific authorization enacted after August 27, 1974, or to satisfy the full faith and credit provision of section 2197(c) of this title. In order to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance, the Corporation is authorized to issue from time to time for purchase by the Secretary of the Treasury its notes, debentures, bonds, or other obligations; but the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000. Any such obligation shall be repaid to the Treasury within one year after the date of issue of such obligation. Any such obligation shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of any obligation authorized by this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligation of the Corporation issued under this subsection, and for such purchase he may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 after August 27, 1974. The purpose for which securities may be issued under such chapter shall include any such purchase.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Access to financial services and the development of microenterprise are vital factors in the stable growth of developing countries and in the development of free, open, and equitable international economic systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is therefore in the best interest of the United States to facilitate access to financial services and assist the development of microenterprise in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Access to financial services and the development of microenterprises can be supported by programs providing credit, savings, training, technical assistance, business development services, and other financial services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Given the relatively high percentage of populations living in rural areas of developing countries, and the combined high incidence of poverty in rural areas and growing income inequality between rural and urban markets, microenterprise programs should target both rural and urban poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Microenterprise programs have been successful and should continue to empower vulnerable women in the developing world. The Agency should work to ensure that recipients of microenterprise and microfinance development assistance under this subpart communicate and work with nongovernmental organizations and government organizations to identify and assist victims of trafficking as provided for in section 7104(a)(1) of this title and women who are victims of or susceptible to other forms of exploitation and violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Given that microenterprise programs have been successful in empowering disenfranchised groups such as women, microenterprise programs should also target populations disenfranchised due to race or ethnicity in countries where a strong relationship between poverty and race or ethnicity has been demonstrated, such as countries in Latin America.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:564 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Congress has demonstrated its support for microenterprise development assistance programs through the enactment of two comprehensive microenterprise laws:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) The Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 (title I of Public Law 106&ndash;309; 114 Stat. 1082) [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title].</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The report on the effectiveness of the United States Agency for International Development's microfinance program, prepared by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, rated the Agency in the top tier of the 17 donors in this field.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Comptroller General, in a report dated November 2003, found that the United States Agency for International Development has met some, but not all, of the key objectives of such microenterprise development assistance programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Comptroller General's report found, among other things, the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Microenterprise development assistance generally can help alleviate some impacts of poverty, improve income levels and quality of life for borrowers and provide poor individuals, workers, and their families with an important coping mechanism.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Microenterprise development assistance programs of the United States Agency for International Development have encouraged women's participation in microfinance projects and, according to data of the Agency, women have comprised two-thirds or more of the micro-loan clients in Agency-funded microenterprise projects since 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The Comptroller General's report recommends that the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development review the Agency's &lsquo;microenterprise results reporting&rsquo; system with the goal of ensuring that its annual reporting is complete and accurate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Specifically, the Administrator should review and reconsider the methodologies used for the collection, analysis, and reporting of data on annual spending targets, outreach to the very poor, sustainability of microfinance institutions, and the contribution of Agency's funding to the institutions it supports.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) should ensure that recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title do not expend an unreasonably large percentage of such assistance on administrative costs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) should not use recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title to carry out critical management functions of the Agency, including functions such as strategy development or overall management of programs in a country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) should consult with the appropriate congressional committees with respect to the implementation of title VI of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 23, 2004].&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Declarations of Policy of 2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;309, title I, &sect;102, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1079, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings and declarations:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) According to the World Bank, more than 1,200,000,000 people in the developing world, or one-fifth of the world's population, subsist on less than $1 a day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Over 32,000 of their children die each day from largely preventable malnutrition and disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads and less access to educational and economic opportunities than their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health and education, as women in particular reinvest income in their families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly women, generally lack stable employment and social safety nets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial portion of their livelihood. In Africa, over 80 percent of employment is generated in the informal sector of the self-employed poor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-employment activities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:568 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their businesses dramatically when they can access loans at reasonable interest rates.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Through the development of self-sustaining microfinance programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against hunger and poverty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6)(A) On February 2&ndash;4, 1997, a global Microcredit Summit was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a plan to expand access to credit for self-employment and other financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's poorest families, especially the women of those families, by 2005. While this scale of outreach may not be achievable in this short time-period, the realization of this goal could dramatically alter the face of global poverty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) With an average family size of five, achieving this goal will mean that the benefits of microfinance will thereby reach nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 absolute poor people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7)(A) Nongovernmental organizations, such as those that comprise the Microenterprise Coalition (such as the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh), K&ndash;REP (Kenya), and networks such as Accion International, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), and the credit union movement) are successful in lending directly to the very poor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Microfinance institutions such as BRAC (Bangladesh), BancoSol (Bolivia), SEWA Bank (India), and ACEP (Senegal) are regulated financial institutions that can raise funds directly from the local and international capital markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) Microenterprise institutions not only reduce poverty, but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Interest income on the credit portfolio is used to pay recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term sustainability of development assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Microfinance institutions leverage foreign assistance resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits to program participants.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) The development of sustainable microfinance institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize domestic savings, is a critical component to a global strategy of poverty reduction and broad-based economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) In the efforts of the United States to lead the development of a new global financial architecture, microenterprise should play a vital role. The recent shocks to international financial markets demonstrate how the financial sector can shape the destiny of nations. Microfinance can serve as a powerful tool for building a more inclusive financial sector which serves the broad majority of the world's population including the very poor and women and thus generate more social stability and prosperity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) Over the last two decades, the United States has been a global leader in promoting the global microenterprise sector, primarily through its development assistance programs at the United States Agency for International Development. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State have used their authority to promote microenterprise in the development programs of international financial institutions and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International Development launched the &lsquo;Microenterprise Initiative&rsquo; in partnership with the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, by the end of fiscal year 1996, one-half of all microenterprise resources would support programs and institutions that provide credit to the poorest, with loans under $300.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, increased investment in microfinance institutions serving the poorest will be critical.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit will require only a small increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microfinance institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) These institutions need assistance in developing their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap commercial sources of capital.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated competence in developing networks of local microfinance institutions and other assistance delivery mechanisms so that they reach large numbers of the very poor, and achieve financial sustainability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) Recognizing that the United States Agency for International Development has developed very effective partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the Agency will have fewer missions overseas to carry out its work, the Agency should place priority on investing in those nongovernmental network institutions that meet performance criteria through the central funding mechanisms of the Agency.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) By expanding and replicating successful microfinance institutions, it should be possible to create a global infrastructure to provide financial services to the world's poorest families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17)(A) The United States can provide leadership to other bilateral and multilateral development agencies as such agencies expand their support to the microenterprise sector.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The United States should seek to improve coordination among G&ndash;7 countries in the support of the microenterprise sector in order to leverage the investment of the United States with that of other donor nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Through increased support for microenterprise, especially credit for the poorest, the United States can continue to play a leadership role in the global effort to expand financial services and opportunity to 100,000,000 of the poorest families on the planet.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional objectives and findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that, in order to achieve the mutual goals among nations of ensuring food security, human health, agricultural growth, trade expansion, and the wise and sustainable use of natural resources, the United States should mobilize the capacities of the United States land-grant universities, other eligible universities, and public and private partners of universities in the United States and other countries, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a&ndash;1 of this title, for: (1) global research on problems affecting food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; (2) improved human capacity and institutional resource development for the global application of agricultural and related environmental sciences; (3) agricultural development and trade research and extension services in the United States and other countries to support the entry of rural industries into world markets; and (4) providing for the application of agricultural sciences to solving food, health, nutrition, rural income, and environmental problems, especially such problems in low-income, food deficit countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress so declares because it finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress with and through the private sector in this country and to understanding processes of economic development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with international agencies, educational and research institutions in other countries, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations worldwide, in expanding global agricultural production, processing, business and trade, to the benefit of aid recipient countries and of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that, in a world of growing populations with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger and ensure human health and child survival, but to build the basis for economic growth and trade, and the social security in which democracy and a market economy can thrive, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies and incomes to purchase food is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current incomes are lowest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that, with expanding global markets and increasing imports into many countries, including the United States, food safety and quality, as well as secure supply, have emerged as mutual concerns of all countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional and policy development therefore are prime factors in improving agricultural production, food distribution, processing, storage, and marketing abroad (as well as in the United States);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture and the broader economy of the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) that there is a need to responsibly manage the world's agricultural and natural resources for sustained productivity, health and resilience to climate variability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) that universities and public and private partners of universities need a dependable source of funding in order to increase the impact of their own investments and those of their State governments and constituencies, in order to continue and expand their efforts to advance agricultural development in cooperating countries, to translate development into economic growth and trade for the United States and cooperating countries, and to prepare future teachers, researchers, extension specialists, entrepreneurs, managers, and decisionmakers for the world economy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration for collation of components to increase world food production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the following components must be brought together in a coordinated program to increase world food and fiber production, agricultural trade, and responsible management of natural resources, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) continued efforts by the international agricultural research centers and other international research entities to provide a global network, including United States universities, for international scientific collaboration on <!-- PDFPage:574 -->crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems of worldwide importance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contract research and the implementation of collaborative research support programs and other research collaboration led by United States universities, and involving research systems in other countries focused on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems, with benefits to the United States and partner countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) broadly disseminating the benefits of global agricultural research and development including increased benefits for United States agriculturally related industries through establishment of development and trade information and service centers, for rural as well as urban communities, through extension, cooperatively with, and supportive of, existing public and private trade and development related organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilitation of participation by universities and public and private partners of universities in programs of multilateral banks and agencies which receive United States funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) expanding learning opportunities about global agriculture for students, teachers, community leaders, entrepreneurs, and the general public through international internships and exchanges, graduate assistantships, faculty positions, and other means of education and extension through long-term recurring Federal funds matched by State funds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) competitive grants through universities to United States agriculturalists and public and private partners of universities from other countries for research, institution and policy development, extension, training, and other programs for global agricultural development, trade, and responsible management of natural resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) University involvement, participation, and cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each of the program components described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide mechanisms for the universities and public and private partners of universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assist such universities and public and private partners of universities in cooperative joint efforts with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) agricultural institutions in developing nations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) regional and international agricultural research centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) multilateral banks and agencies receiving United States funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) development agencies of other countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) United States Government foreign assistance and economic cooperation programs;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) generally engage the United States university community more extensively in the agricultural research, trade, and development initiatives undertaken outside the United States, with the objectives of strengthening its capacity to carry out research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, processing, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally developing nations, and for transforming progress in global agricultural research and development into economic growth, trade, and trade benefits for aid recipient countries and United States communities and industries, and for the wise use of natural resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure that all federally funded support to universities and public and private partners of universities relating to the goals of this subpart is periodically reviewed for its performance.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) half a billion people suffer regularly from malnutrition or undernutrition;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) even very modest shortfalls in crop production can result in greatly increased human suffering, and undercut the benefits of bilateral and multilateral assistance programs, in poor developing countries with chronic food deficits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) increasing variability in world food production and trade presents a serious threat not only to consumers but also to producers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the World Food Conference recognized the urgent need for an international undertaking to achieve a system of world food security based largely upon strategic food reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Congress through legislation has repeatedly urged the President to negotiate with other nations to establish such a system of reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) although the nations of the world have agreed to begin discussions on a system of grain reserves to regulate food availability, agreement on a global network of nationally held reserves still eludes the international community;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Education that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global strategy to eliminate terrorism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Education in the Middle East about the world outside that region is weak.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The United Nations has rightly equated literacy with freedom.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The international community is moving toward setting a concrete goal of reducing by half the illiteracy rate in the Middle East by 2010, through the implementation of education programs targeting women and girls and programs for adult literacy, and by other means.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:587 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To be effective, efforts to improve education in the Middle East must also include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) support for the provision of basic education tools, such as textbooks that translate more of the world's knowledge into local languages and local libraries to house such materials; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more vocational education in trades and business skills.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Middle East can benefit from some of the same programs to bridge the digital divide that already have been developed for other regions of the world.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) International Youth Opportunity Fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of State is authorized to establish through an existing international organization, such as the United Nations Educational, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) or other similar body, an International Youth Opportunity Fund to provide financial assistance for the improvement of public education in the Middle East and other countries of strategic interest with predominantly Muslim populations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) International participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary should seek the cooperation of the international community in establishing and generously supporting the Fund.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the building of democracy, the restoration of peace, the improvement of living conditions, and the application of equal justice under law in Central America are important to the interests of the United States and the community of American States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the interrelated issues of social and human progress, economic growth, political reform, and regional security must be effectively dealt with to assure a democratic and economically and politically secure Central America.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The achievement of democracy, respect for human rights, peace, and equitable economic growth depends primarily on the cooperation and the human and economic resources of the people and governments of Central America. The Congress recognizes that the United States can make a significant contribution to such peaceful and democratic development through a consistent and coherent policy which includes a long-term commitment of assistance. This policy should be designed to support actively&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) democracy and political reform, including opening the political process to all members of society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) full observance of internationally recognized human rights, including free elections, freedom of the press, freedom of association, and the elimination of all human rights abuses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) leadership development, including training and educational programs to improve public administration and the administration of justice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) land reform, reform in tax systems, encouragement of private enterprise and individual initiative, creation of favorable investment climates, curbing corruption where it exists, and spurring balanced trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the establishment of the rule of law and an effective judicial system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the termination of extremist violence by both the left and the right as well as vigorous action to prosecute those guilty of crimes and the prosecution to the extent possible of past offenders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The policy described in paragraph (1) should also promote equitable economic growth and development, including controlling the flight of capital and the effective use of foreign assistance and adhering to approved programs for economic stabilization and fiscal responsibility. Finally, this policy should foster dialog and negotiations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to achieve peace based upon the objectives of democratization, reduction of armament, an end to subversion, and the withdrawal of foreign military forces and advisers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to provide a security shield against violence and intimidation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that participation by Central American countries in an effective forum for dialog on, and the continuous review and advancement of, Central America's political, economic, and social development would foster cooperation between the United States and Central American countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress; Central American Development Organization; establishment, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the President should enter into negotiations with the countries of Central America to establish a Central American Development Organization (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Organization&rdquo;) to help provide a continuous and coherent approach to the development of the Central American region; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the establishment of the Organization should be based upon the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Participation in the Organization should be open to the United States, other donors, and those Central American countries that commit themselves to, among other things, respecting internationally recognized human rights, building democracy, and encouraging equitable economic growth through policy reforms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Organization should be structured to include representatives from both the public and private sectors, including representatives from the labor, agriculture, and business communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Organization should meet periodically to carry out the functions described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph and should be supported by a limited professional secretariat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Organization should make recommendations affecting Central American countries on such matters as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) political, economic, and social development objectives, including the strengthening of democratic pluralism and the safeguarding of internationally recognized human rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) mobilization of resources and external assistance needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) reform of economic policies and structures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The Organization should have the capacity for monitoring country performance on recommendations issued in accordance with subparagraph (D) of this paragraph and for evaluating progress toward meeting such country objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) To the maximum extent practicable, the United States should follow the recommendations of the Organization in disbursing bilateral economic assistance for any Central American country. No more than 75 percent of such United States assistance in any fiscal year should be disbursed until the recommendations of the Organization for that fiscal year have been made final and communicated to the donor countries. The limitation on disbursements contained in the preceding sentence should apply only to recommendations made final and communicated to donor countries prior to the fourth quarter of such fiscal year. The United States representative to the Organization should urge other donor countries to similarly implement the recommendations of the Organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, or his designee, should represent the United States Government in the Organization and should carry out his functions in that capacity under the continuous supervision and general direction of the Secretary of State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Participation of President in Organization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (d)(2) of this section, the President is authorized to participate in the Organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preparation and transmission of proposal for implementation of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, under the supervision and direction of the Secretary of State, shall prepare a detailed proposal to carry out this section and shall keep the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate fully and currently informed concerning the development of this proposal.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multilateral assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to vote, on and after March 1 of each year, against any loan or other utilization of the funds of their respective institution to or for any major illicit drug producing country or major drug-transit country (as determined under subsection (h) of this section), except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) What must be certified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the assistance withheld from a country pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may be obligated and expended, and the requirement of subsection (a)(2) of this section to vote against multilateral development bank assistance to a country shall not apply, if the President determines and certifies to the Congress, at the time of the submission of the report required by section 2291h(a) of this title, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during the previous year the country has cooperated fully with the United States, or has taken adequate steps on its own, to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives established by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a country that would not otherwise qualify for certification under subparagraph (A), the vital national interests of the United States require that the assistance withheld pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section be provided and that the United States not vote against multilateral development bank assistance for that country pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations regarding cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determination described in paragraph (1)(A), the President shall consider the extent to which the country has&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:614 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information to be included in national interest certification</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The President may make a certification under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section with respect to a major illicit drug producing country, or major drug-transit country, that is a producer of licit opium only if the President determines that such country maintains licit production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand, and has taken adequate steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit cultivation and production into the illicit markets and to prevent illicit cultivation and production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Congressional review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (e) of this section shall apply if, within 30 calendar days after receipt of a certification submitted under subsection (b) of this section at the time of submission of the report required by section 2291h(a) of this title, the Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the determination of the President contained in such certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Denial of assistance for countries decertified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President does not make a certification under subsection (b) of this section with respect to a country or the Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving such certification, then until such time as the conditions specified in subsection (f) of this section are satisfied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds may not be obligated for United States assistance for that country, and funds previously obligated for United States assistance for that country may not be expended for the purpose of providing assistance for that country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement to vote against multilateral development bank assistance pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section shall apply with respect to that country, without regard to the date specified in that subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (e) of this section shall apply to a country described in that subsection until&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the President, at any other time, makes the certification described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section with respect to that country, except that this paragraph applies only if either&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2006</h4>
<p class="note-body">Determination of President of the United States, No. 2005&ndash;36, Sept. 14, 2005, 70 F.R. 56807, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of State</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107&ndash;228) (FRAA) [22 U.S.C. 2291j&ndash;1(1)], I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p class="note-body">A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug-transit or drug-producing country set fourth [sic] in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA) [22 U.S.C. 2291(e)(2), (5)], one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA [22 U.S.C. 2291j&ndash;1(2)(A)], I hereby designated [sic] Burma and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably dur<!-- PDFPage:617 -->ing the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set fourth [sic] in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA [22 U.S.C. 2291h(a)(1)]. Attached to this report (Tab A) are justifications for the determinations on Burma and Venezuela [not set out in the Code], as required by section 706(2)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA [22 U.S.C. 2291j&ndash;1(3)(A)], that support for program [sic] to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions, establish selected community development projects, and strengthen Venezuela's political party system is vital to the national interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have removed China and Vietnam from the list of major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries because there is insufficient evidence to suggest that China is a major source zone or transit country for illicit narcotics that significantly affects the United States. There is insufficient evidence to refute claims by the Government of Vietnam that they have virtually eliminated opium poppy production. Additionally, although cooperation with United States law enforcement is limited, there are no indications of a significant Vietnam-based drug threat to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Despite the Government of Afghanistan's counternarcotics efforts, we remain concerned about the disturbing magnitude of the drug trade and the prospect that opium poppy cultivation will likely increase in 2006. We are also concerned about government corruption, especially at the regional and local levels, impending [sic] counternarcotics efforts. For these efforts to be effective, government corruption with respect to the opium economy must be seriously addressed-by both local and central government authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Government of Canada has made real progress in curbing the diversion into the United States of pseudoephedrine, which fuels the production of methamphetamine. There are indications, however, that Canadian-based criminal groups are increasingly involved in the production of MDMA (Ecstasy) destined for the United States. Large scale cross-border trafficking of Canadian-grown marijuana remains a serious concern. The United States appreciates the excellent law enforcement cooperation with Canada in combating these shared threats.</p>
<p class="note-body">While Haiti made efforts this year to improve its performance, we reiterate our concerns from last year about the Interim Government of Haiti's inability to effectively organize Haitian law enforcement resources to permit sustained counternarcotics efforts. Further, the national criminal justice system must be significantly strengthened in order to be effective and gain public confidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Government of The Netherlands has achieved considerable success in countering the production and flow of MDMA (Ecstasy) to the United States, and The Netherlands is commended for its enhanced efforts. In the coming year, the United States would like to build upon our law enforcement cooperation with the Dutch government through advancements in mutual legal assistance and direct engagement between our respective police agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Drug trafficking, money laundering, and other organized criminal activity in Nigeria remain major sources of concern to the United States. Progress over the past year on anti-money laundering controls is welcome, but much remains to be done to make such controls effective. Implementing anti-corruption policies must advance more quickly, as corruption at all levels of government continues to hamper effective narcotics law enforcement. In addition, measures similar to those taken to improve drug law enforcement at Nigeria's main airport need to be expanded to, and replicated at, Nigeria's seaports, where drug trafficking is a growing concern. Finally, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and other counternarcotics institutions should work towards developing the mindset and capacity to pursue investigations, and prosecutions of major drug traffickers based in the country.</p>
<p class="note-body">We remain concerned with the continued involvement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in criminal activity, including drug production and drug trafficking. Given the close relationship between Japanese and Chinese criminal elements and DPRK drug traffickers in past smuggling incidents, there is a real possibility of continuing DPRK involvement in drug trafficking, even when a given incident appears only to involve ethnic Chinese or other organized Asian criminal groups.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) drought and famine have caused countless deaths and untold suffering among the people of sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) drought and famine in combination with other factors such as desertification, government neglect of the agricultural sector, and inappropriate economic policies have severely affected long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the most cost-effective and efficient way of overcoming Africa's vulnerability to drought and famine is to address Africa's long-term development needs through a process that builds upon the needs and capabilities of the African people, promotes sustained and equitable economic growth, preserves the environment, and protects the rights of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority to furnish assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to furnish project and program assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine in accordance with the policies contained in this section, for long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;385, &sect;2, Nov. 13, 1998, 112 Stat. 3460, provided that:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:627 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The economic, security, and humanitarian interests of the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa would be enhanced by sustainable, broad-based agricultural and rural development in each of the African nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of undernourished people in Africa has more than doubled, from approximately 100,000,000 in the late 1960s to 215,000,000 in 1998, and is projected to increase to 265,000,000 by the year 2010. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the term &lsquo;under nutrition&rsquo; means inadequate consumption of nutrients, often adversely affecting children's physical and mental development, undermining their future as productive and creative members of their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Currently, agricultural production in Africa employs about two-thirds of the workforce but produces less than one-fourth of the gross domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank Group.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) African women produce up to 80 percent of the total food supply in Africa according to the International Food Policy Research Institute.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) An effective way to improve conditions of the poor is to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. Productivity increases can be fostered by increasing research and education in agriculture and rural development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In November 1996, the World Food Summit set a goal of reducing hunger worldwide by 50 percent by the year 2015 and encouraged national governments to develop domestic food plans and to support international aid efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Although the World Bank Group recently has launched a major initiative to support agricultural and rural development, only 10 percent, or $1,200,000,000, of its total lending to sub-Saharan Africa for fiscal years 1993 to 1997 was devoted to agriculture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) United States food processing and agricultural sectors benefit greatly from the liberalization of global trade and increased exports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Africa represents a growing market for United States food and agricultural products. Africa's food imports are projected to rise from less than 8,000,000 metric tons in 1990 to more than 25,000,000 metric tons by the [sic] 2020.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9)(A) Increased private sector investment in African countries and expanded trade between the United States and Africa can greatly help African countries achieve food self-sufficiency and graduate from dependency on international assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Development assistance, technical assistance, and training can facilitate and encourage commercial development in Africa, such as improving rural roads, agricultural research and extension, and providing access to credit and other resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) Several United States private voluntary organizations have demonstrated success in empowering Africans through direct business ownership and helping African agricultural producers more efficiently and directly market their products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Rural business associations, owned and controlled by farmer shareholders, also greatly help agricultural producers to increase their household incomes.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Declaration of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States, consistent with title XII of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [probably means title XII of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. 2220a et seq.], to support governments of sub-Saharan African countries, United States and African nongovernmental organizations, universities, businesses, and international agencies, to help ensure the availability of basic nutrition and economic opportunities for individuals in sub-Saharan Africa, through sustainable agriculture and rural development.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) shall ensure that programs are designed and conducted in cooperation with African and United States organizations and institutions, such as private and voluntary organizations, cooperatives, land-grant and other appropriate universities, and local producer-owned cooperative marketing and buying associations, that have expertise in addressing the needs of the poor, small-scale farmers, entrepreneurs, and rural workers, including women.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of the Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of the Congress that, if there is an increase in funding for sub-Saharan programs, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should proportionately increase resources to the Africa Food Security Initiative, or any comparable or successor program, for fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years in order to meet the needs of the countries participating in such Initiative.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;246, &sect;2, Oct. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 1511, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the leadership of the Russian Federation has publicly committed itself to building&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a society with democratic political institutions and practices, the observance of universally recognized standards of human rights, and religious and press freedom; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) a market economy based on internationally accepted principles of transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In order to facilitate this transition, the international community has provided multilateral and bilateral technical assistance, and the United States&rsquo; contribution to these efforts has played an important role in developing new institutions built on democratic and liberal economic foundations and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3)(A) Since 1992, United States Government democratic reform programs and public diplomacy programs, including training, and small grants have provided access to and training in the use of the Internet, brought nearly 40,000 Russian citizens to the United States, and have led to the establishment of more than 65,000 nongovernmental organizations, thousands of independent local media outlets, despite governmental opposition, and numerous political parties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) These efforts contributed to the substantially free and fair Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1999.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States has assisted Russian efforts to replace its centrally planned, state-controlled economy with a market economy and helped create institutions and infrastructure for a market economy. Approximately two-thirds of the Russian Federation's gross domestic product is now generated by the private sector, and the United States recognized Russia as a market economy on June 7, 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The United States has fostered grassroots entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation by focusing United States economic assistance on small- and medium-sized businesses and by providing training, consulting services, and small loans to more than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) There are now more than 900,000 small businesses in the Russian Federation, producing 12 to 15 percent, depending on the estimate, of the gross domestic product of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) United States-funded programs have contributed to fighting corruption and financial crime, such as money laundering, by helping to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(i) establish a commercial legal infrastructure;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) develop an independent judiciary;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(iii) support the drafting of a new criminal code, civil code, and bankruptcy law;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(iv) develop a legal and regulatory framework for the Russian Federation's equivalent of the <!-- PDFPage:631 -->United States Securities and Exchange Commission;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(v) support Russian law schools;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(vi) create legal aid clinics; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(vii) bolster law-related activities of nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Because the capability of Russian democratic forces and the civil society to organize and defend democratic gains without international support is uncertain, and because the gradual integration of the Russian Federation into the global order of free-market, democratic nations would enhance Russian cooperation with the United States on a wide range of political, economic, and security issues, the success of democracy in Russia is in the national security interest of the United States, and the United States Government should develop a far-reaching and flexible strategy aimed at strengthening Russian society's support for democracy and a market economy, particularly by enhancing Russian democratic institutions and education, promoting the rule of law, and supporting Russia's independent media.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Russian Federation has stood with the United States and the rest of the civilized world in the struggle against terrorism and has cooperated in the war in Afghanistan by sharing intelligence and through other means.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) United States-Russia relations have improved, leading to a successful summit between President Bush and President Putin in May 2002, resulting in a &lsquo;Foundation for Cooperation&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to strengthen and advance institutions of democratic government and of free and independent media, and to sustain the development of an independent civil society in the Russian Federation based on religious and ethnic tolerance, internationally recognized human rights, and an internationally recognized rule of law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to focus United States foreign assistance programs on using local expertise and to give local organizations a greater role in designing and implementing such programs, while maintaining appropriate oversight and monitoring.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to incorporate democratic reforms, the promotion of independent media, and economic reforms in a broader United States dialogue with the Government of the Russian Federation;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to persuade the Government of the Russian Federation to honor its commitments made to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the November 1999 Istanbul Conference, and to conduct a genuine good neighbor policy toward the other independent states of the former Soviet Union in the spirit of internationally accepted principles of regional cooperation; and</p>
