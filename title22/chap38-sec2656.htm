<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Congressional Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has &lsquo;been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism. At the level of high policy, Saudi Arabia's leaders cooperated with American diplomatic initiatives aimed at the Taliban or Pakistan before 9/11. At the same time, Saudi Arabia's society was a place where al Qaeda raised money directly from individuals and through charities. It was the society that produced 15 of the 19 hijackers.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Saudi Arabia has an uneven record in the fight against terrorism, especially with respect to terrorist financing, support for radical madrassas, a lack of political outlets for its citizens, and restrictions on religious pluralism, that poses a threat to the security of the United States, the international community, and Saudi Arabia itself.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States concluded that the &lsquo;problems in the U.S.-Saudi relationship must be confronted, openly&rsquo;. It recommended that the two countries build a relationship that includes a &lsquo;shared commitment to political and economic reform .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a shared interest in greater tolerance and cultural respect, translating into a commitment to fight the violent extremists who foment hatred&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States has a national security interest in working with the Government of Saudi Arabia to combat international terrorists that operate within that country or that operate outside Saudi Arabia with the support of citizens of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The United States and Saudi Arabia established a Strategic Dialogue in 2005, which provides a framework for the two countries to discuss a range of bilateral issues at high levels, including counterterrorism policy and political and economic reforms.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) It is in the national security interest of the United States to support the Government of Saudi Arabia in undertaking a number of political and economic reforms, including increasing anti-terrorism operations conducted by law enforcement agencies, providing more political and religious rights to its citizens, increasing the rights of women, engaging in comprehensive educational reform, enhancing monitoring of charitable organizations, and promulgating and enforcing domestic laws and regulation on terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to engage with the Government of Saudi Arabia to openly confront the issue of terrorism, as well <!-- PDFPage:881 -->as other problematic issues such as the lack of political freedoms;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to enhance counterterrorism cooperation with the Government of Saudi Arabia; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;458, title VII, &sect;7101, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3775, provided that: &ldquo;Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Long-term success in the war on terrorism demands the use of all elements of national power, including diplomacy, military action, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland defense.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To win the war on terrorism, the United States must assign to economic and diplomatic capabilities the same strategic priority that is assigned to military capabilities.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Almost every aspect of the counterterrorism strategy of the United States relies on international cooperation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Since September 11, 2001, the number and scope of United States Government contacts with foreign governments concerning counterterrorism have expanded significantly, but such contacts have often been ad hoc and not integrated as a comprehensive and unified approach to counterterrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of State is authorized in consultation with relevant United States Government agencies, to negotiate on a bilateral or multilateral basis, as appropriate, international agreements under which parties to an agreement work in partnership to address and interdict acts of international terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>International Contact Group on Counterterrorism.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Sense of congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) should seek to engage the leaders of the governments of other countries in a process of advancing beyond separate and uncoordinated national counterterrorism strategies to develop with those other governments a comprehensive multilateral strategy to fight terrorism; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to that end, should seek to establish an international counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of governments providing leadership in global counterterrorism efforts and governments of countries with sizable Muslim populations, to be used as a ready and flexible international means for discussing and coordinating the development of important counterterrorism policies by the participating governments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President is authorized to establish an international counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of governments referred to in paragraph (1) for the following purposes:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) To meet annually, or more frequently as the President determines appropriate, to develop in common with such other governments important policies and a strategy that address the various components of international prosecution of the war on terrorism, including policies and a strategy that address military issues, law enforcement, the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence, issues relating to interdiction of travel by terrorists, counterterrorism-related customs issues, financial issues, and issues relating to terrorist sanctuaries.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) To address, to the extent (if any) that the President and leaders of other participating governments determine appropriate, long-term issues that can contribute to strengthening stability and security in the Middle East.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Many of the international terrorists who planned and carried out large-scale attacks against foreign targets, including the attack in Bali, Indonesia, on October 11, 2002, and the attack in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, 2004, traveled across international borders to plan and carry out these attacks.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were carrying passports that had been manipulated in a fraudulent manner.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, (commonly referred to as the 9/11 Commission), stated that &lsquo;Targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money.&rsquo;.</p>
