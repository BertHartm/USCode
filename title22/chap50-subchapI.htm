<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3682. Cash relief to certain former employees</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Continuation of cash relief payments to employees under Act of July 8, 1937</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, under the regulations prescribed by the President pursuant to the Act en<!-- PDFPage:952 -->titled &ldquo;An Act authorizing cash relief for certain employees of the Panama Canal not coming within the provisions of the Canal Zone Retirement Act&rdquo;, approved July 8, 1937, as amended (50 Stat. 478; 68 Stat. 17), may continue the payments of cash relief to those individual former employees of the Canal Zone Government or Panama Canal Company or their predecessor agencies not coming within the scope of the former Canal Zone Retirement Act whose services were terminated prior to October 5, 1958, because of unfitness for further useful service by reason of mental or physical disability resulting from age or disease. Subject to subsection (b) of this section, that cash relief may not exceed $1.50 per month for each year of service of the employees so furnished relief, with a maximum of $45 per month, plus the amount of any cost-of-living increases in such cash relief granted before October 1, 1979, pursuant to section 181 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code (as in effect on September 30, 1979), nor be paid to any employee who, at the time of termination for disability prior to October 5, 1958, had less than 10 years&rsquo; service with the Canal Zone Government, the Panama Canal Company, or their predecessor agencies on the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional amounts for relief under subsection (a)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An additional amount of $20 per month shall be paid to each person who receives payment of cash relief under subsection (a) of this section and shall be allowed without regard to the limitations contained therein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increases in cash relief payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cash relief payment made pursuant to this section shall be increased on the same effective date and by the same percent, adjusted to the nearest dollar, as civil service retirement annuities are increased under the cost-of-living adjustment provisions of section 8340(b) of title 5. Such increase shall apply only to cash relief payments made after October 1, 1979, as increased by annuity increases made after that date under such section 8340(b) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cash relief payments to widows</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may pay cash relief to the widow of any former employee of the Canal Zone Government or the Panama Canal Company who, until the time of his death, receives or has received cash relief under subsection (a) of this section, under section 181 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code (as in effect on September 30, 1979), or under the Act of July 8, 1937, referred to in such subsection (a) of this section. The term &ldquo;widow&rdquo; as used in this subsection includes only the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a woman legally married to such employee at the time of his termination for disability and at his death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a woman who, although not legally married to such former employee at the time of his termination, had resided continuously with him for at least five years immediately preceding the employee's termination under such circumstances as would at common law make the relationship a valid marriage and who continued to reside with him until his death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a woman who has not remarried or assumed a common-law relationship with any other person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Cash relief granted to such a widow shall not at any time exceed 50 percent of the rate at which cash relief, inclusive of any additional payment under subsection (b) of this section, would be payable to the former employee were he then alive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Applicability of subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 applies with respect to those individuals who were in the service of the Canal Zone Government or the Panama Canal Company on October 5, 1958, and who, except for the operation of section 13(a)(1) of the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to implement item 1 of a Memorandum of Understanding attached to the treaty of January 25, 1955, entered into by the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Panama with respect to wage and employment practices of the Government of the United States of America in the Canal Zone&rdquo;, approved July 25, 1958 (72 Stat. 405), would have been within the classes of individuals subject to the Act of July 8, 1937, referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) No funds may be authorized for the use of the Commission, or obligated or expended by the Commission in any fiscal year in excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund and the Panama Canal Dissolution Fund during such fiscal year, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund before such fiscal year and remaining unexpended at the beginning of such fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall report to the Congress the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund during such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority of Commission to make deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commission may deposit amounts in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund in any Federal Reserve bank, any depository for public funds, or in such other places and in such manner as the Commission and the Secretary may agree.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review of annual budget</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Committee on Appropriations of each House of Congress shall review the annual budget of the Commission, including operations and capital expenditures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Costs of implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is the sense of the Congress that the additional costs resulting from implementation of <!-- PDFPage:955 -->the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements should be kept to the absolute minimum level. To this end, the Congress declares that the direct appropriated costs of implementation to be borne by the taxpayers over the life of such Treaty should be kept to a level no greater than the March 1979 estimate of those costs ($870,700,000) presented to the Congress by the executive branch during consideration of this chapter by the Congress, less personnel retirement costs of $205,000,000, which were subtracted and charged to tolls, therefore resulting in the net taxpayer cost of approximately $665,700,000, plus appropriate adjustment for inflation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is further the sense of the Congress that the actual costs of implementation be consistent with the obligations of the United States to operate the Panama Canal safely and efficiently and keep it secure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall promptly adjust and pay damages for injuries to vessels, or to the cargo, crew, or passengers of vessels, which may arise by reason of their passage through the locks of the Panama Canal when the injury was proximately caused by negligence or fault on the part of an officer or employee of the United States acting within the scope of his employment and in the line of his duties in connection with the operation of the Canal. If the negligence or fault of the vessel, master, crew, or passengers proximately contributed to the injury, the award of damages shall be diminished in proportion to the negligence or fault attributable to the vessel, master, crew, or passengers. Damages may not be allowed and paid for injuries to any protrusion beyond any portion of the hull of a vessel, whether it is permanent or temporary in character. A vessel is considered to be passing through the locks of the Canal, under the control of officers or employees of the United States, from the time the first towing line is made fast on board before entrance into the locks and until the towing lines are cast off upon, or immediately prior to, departure from the lock chamber. No payment for damages on a claim may be made under this section unless the claim is filed with the Commission within 2 years after the date of the injury, or within 1 year after December 23, 1985, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) With respect to a claim under subsection (a) of this section for damages for injuries to a vessel or its cargo, if, at the time the injuries were incurred, the navigation or movement of the vessel was not under the control of a Panama Canal pilot, the Commission may pay not more than $50,000 on the claim, unless the injuries were caused by another vessel under the control of a Panama Canal pilot.</p>
