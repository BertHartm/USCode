<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), in any case of serious injury, loss of life, or significant destruction of property at, or related to, a United States Government mission abroad, and in any case of a serious breach of security involving intelligence activities of a foreign government directed at a United States Government mission abroad, which is covered by the provisions of this chapter (other than a facility or installation subject to the control of a United States area military commander), the Secretary of State shall convene an Accountability Review Board (in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;). The Secretary shall not convene a Board where the Secretary determines that a case clearly involves only causes unrelated to security.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Department of Defense facilities and personnel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of State is not required to convene a Board in the case of an incident described in paragraph (1) that involves any facility, installation, or personnel of the Department of Defense with respect to which the Secretary has delegated operational control of overseas security functions to the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 4805 of this title. In any such case, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct an appropriate inquiry. The Secretary of Defense shall report the findings and recommendations of such inquiry, and the action taken with respect to such recommendations, to the Secretary of State and Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deadlines for convening Boards</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Delay in cases involving intelligence activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to breaches of security involving intelligence activities, the Secretary of State may delay the establishment of a Board if, after consultation with the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, the Secretary determines that the establishment of a Board would compromise intelligence sources or methods. The Secretary shall promptly advise the chairmen of such committees of each determination pursuant to this paragraph to delay the establishment of a Board.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notification to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary of State convenes a Board, the Secretary shall promptly inform the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that a Board has been convened;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) of the membership of the Board; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) of other appropriate information about the Board.</p>
