<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8001. Sense of Congress</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1671 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, the means to produce them, and the means to deliver them are critical objectives for United States foreign policy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) sustaining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and strengthening its implementation, particularly its verification and compliance, is the keystone of United States nonproliferation policy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the NPT has been a significant success in preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities and maintaining a stable international security situation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) countries that have never become a party to the NPT and remain outside that treaty's legal regime pose a potential challenge to the achievement of the overall goals of global nonproliferation, because those countries have not undertaken the NPT obligation to prohibit the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) it is in the interest of the United States to the fullest extent possible to ensure that those countries that are not States Party to the NPT are responsible in the disposition of any nuclear technology they develop;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) it is in the interest of the United States to enter into an agreement for nuclear cooperation arranged pursuant to section 2153 of title 42 with a country that has never been a State Party to the NPT if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the country has demonstrated responsible behavior with respect to the nonproliferation of technology related to nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the country has a functioning and uninterrupted democratic system of government, has a foreign policy that is congruent to that of the United States, and is working with the United States on key foreign policy initiatives related to nonproliferation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such cooperation induces the country to promulgate and implement substantially improved protections against the proliferation of technology related to nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, and to refrain from actions that would further the development of its nuclear weapons program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such cooperation will induce the country to give greater political and material support to the achievement of United States global and regional nonproliferation objectives, especially with respect to dissuading, isolating, and, if necessary, sanctioning and containing states that sponsor terrorism and terrorist groups that are seeking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability or other weapons of mass destruction capability and the means to deliver such weapons;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the United States should continue its policy of engagement, collaboration, and exchanges with and between India and Pakistan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) strong bilateral relations with India are in the national interest of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the United States and India share common democratic values and the potential for increasing and sustained economic engagement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) commerce in civil nuclear energy with India by the United States and other countries has the potential to benefit the people of all countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) such commerce also represents a significant change in United States policy regarding commerce with countries that are not States Party to the NPT, which remains the foundation of the international nonproliferation regime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) any commerce in civil nuclear energy with India by the United States and other countries must be achieved in a manner that minimizes the risk of nuclear proliferation or regional arms races and maximizes India's adherence to international nonproliferation regimes, including, in particular, the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the United States should not seek to facilitate or encourage the continuation of nuclear exports to India by any other party if such exports are terminated under United States law.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following shall be the policies of the United States:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Oppose the development of a capability to produce nuclear weapons by any non-nuclear weapon state, within or outside of the NPT.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Encourage States Party to the NPT to interpret the right to &ldquo;develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes&rdquo;, as set forth in Article IV of the NPT, as being a right that applies only to the extent that it is consistent with the object and purpose of the NPT to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons capabilities, including by refraining from all nuclear cooperation with any State Party that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) determines is not in full compliance with its NPT obligations, including its safeguards obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Act in a manner fully consistent with the Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers and the Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment, Materials, Software and Related Technology developed by the NSG, and decisions related to the those&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8002_1_target" name="8002_1">1</a></sup> guidelines, and the rules and practices regarding NSG decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Strengthen the NSG guidelines and decisions concerning consultation by members regarding violations of supplier and recipient understandings by instituting the practice of a timely and coordinated response by NSG members to all such violations, including termination of nuclear transfers to an involved recipient, that discourages individual NSG members from continuing cooperation with such recipient until such time as a consensus regarding a coordinated response has been achieved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Given the special sensitivity of equipment and technologies related to the enrichment of uranium, the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, and the production of heavy water, work with members of the NSG, individually and collectively, to further restrict the transfers of such equipment and technologies, including to India.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Seek to prevent the transfer to a country of nuclear equipment, materials, or technology from other participating governments in the NSG or from any other source if nuclear transfers to that country are suspended or terminated pursuant to this chapter, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), or any other United States law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) With respect to South Asia</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) demonstration of satisfactory progress toward implementing the decision described in subparagraph (C); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) ratification of or accession to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Secure India's full and active participation in United States efforts to dissuade, isolate, and, if necessary, sanction and contain Iran for its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear weapons capability and the capability to enrich uranium or reprocess nuclear fuel, and the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Seek to halt the increase of nuclear weapon arsenals in South Asia and to promote their reduction and eventual elimination.</p>
