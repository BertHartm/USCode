<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department of State is dependent not only on the contribution of Foreign Service employees but equally on the contribution of the 42 percent of the Department's employees who are employed under the Civil Service personnel system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the contribution of these Civil Service employees has been overlooked in the management of the Department and greater equality of promotion, training, and career enhancement opportunities should be accorded to the Civil Service employees of the Department; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a goal of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [22 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.] was to strengthen the contribution made by Civil Service employees of the Department of State by creating a cadre of experienced specialists and managers in the Department to provide essential continuity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Equitable reduction of budget</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State shall take all appropriate steps to assure that the burden of cuts in the budget for the Department is not imposed disproportionately or inequitably upon its Civil Service employees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of Office of the Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established in the Office of the Secretary of State the position of Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees. The position of Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees shall be a career reserved position within the Senior Executive Service. The Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees shall report directly to the Secretary of State and shall have the right to participate in all Management Council meetings to assure that the ability of the Civil Service employees to contribute to the achievement of the Department's mandated responsibilities and the career interests of those employees are adequately represented. The position of Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees shall be designated from one of the Senior Executive Service positions (as defined in section 3132(a)(2) of title 5) in existence on December 22, 1987.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Civil Service employees&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Civil Service employees&rdquo; means employees of the Federal Government except for members of the Foreign Service (as defined in section 103 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [22 U.S.C. 3903]).</p>

Except as provided under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall suspend or terminate services to a Federal agency which has not made full payment for services under this section 180 days after the date of notification. Any costs associated with a suspension or termination of services shall be the responsibility of, and shall be billed to, the Federal agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of State may waive the requirement for suspension or termination under paragraph (2) with respect to such services as the Secretary determines are necessary to ensure the protection of life and the safety of United States Government property.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Removal of actions; remand or dismissal; suspension of limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon a certification by the Attorney General that the defendant was acting within the scope of his or her employment in or for the Department of State or any other Federal department, agency, or instrumentality at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose, any such civil action or proceeding commenced in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States of the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending and the proceeding deemed a tort action brought against the United States under the provisions of title 28, and all references thereto. Should a United States district court determine on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merits that the case so removed is one in which a remedy by suit within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section is not available against the United States, the case shall be remanded to the State court except that where such remedy is precluded because of the availability of a remedy through proceedings for compensation or other benefits from the United States as provided by any other law, the case shall be dismissed, but in that event, the running of any limitation of time for commencing, or filing an application or claim in, such proceedings for compensation or other benefits shall be deemed to have been suspended during <!-- PDFPage:817 -->the pendency of the civil action or proceeding under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State may authorize and assist in the establishment, maintenance, and operation by civilian officers and employees of the Government of non-Government-operated services and facilities at posts abroad, including the furnishing of space, utilities, and properties owned or leased by the Government for use by its diplomatic, consular, and other missions and posts abroad. The provisions of the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 292&ndash;300) and section 2684 of this title may be utilized by the Secretary in providing such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Emergency commissary and mess services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may establish and maintain emergency commissary or mess services in places abroad where, in the judgment of the Secretary, such services are necessary temporarily to insure the effective and efficient performance of official duties and responsibilities. Reimbursements incident to the maintenance and operation of commissary or mess service under this subsection shall be at not less than cost as determined by the Secretary and shall be used as working funds, except that an amount equal to the amount expended for such services shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Availability; duplication of facilities and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Services and facilities established under this section shall be made available, insofar as practicable, to officers and employees of all agencies and their dependents who are stationed in the locality abroad, and, where determined by the Secretary to be appropriate due to exceptional circumstances, to United States citizens hired outside of the host country to serve as teaching staff for such dependents abroad. Such services and facilities shall not be established in localities where another agency operates similar services or facilities unless the Secretary determines that additional services or facilities are necessary. Other agencies shall to the extent practicable avoid duplicating the facilities and services provided or assisted by the Secretary under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Charges at any post abroad for a service or facility provided, authorized or assisted under this section shall be at the same rate for all civilian personnel of the Government serviced thereby, and all charges for supplies furnished to such a service or facility abroad by any agency shall be at the same rate as that charged by the furnishing agency to its comparable civilian services and facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Child care facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State may make grants to child care facilities, to offset in part the cost of such care, in Moscow and at no more than five other posts abroad where the Secretary determines that due to extraordinary circumstances such facilities are necessary to the efficient operation of the post.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Each case involving an alien described in subparagraph (A) in which an appropriate authority of a State, a political subdivision of a State, or the United States reported to the Department of State that the authority had reasonable cause to believe the alien committed a serious criminal offense within the United States, and any additional information provided to the Secretary relating to other serious criminal offenses that any such authority had reasonable cause to believe the alien committed before the period covered by the report. The Secretary may omit from such report any matter the provision of which the Secretary reasonably believes would compromise a criminal investigation or prosecution or which would directly compromise law enforcement or intelligence sources or methods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Each case described in subparagraph (B) in which the Secretary of State has certified that a person enjoys full immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the United States under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The number of United States citizens who are residing in a receiving state and who enjoy full immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of such state under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Each case involving a United States citizen under subparagraph (D) in which the United States has been requested by the government of a receiving state to waive the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the United States citizen.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide that where there is probable cause to believe that an individual who is entitled to immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities committed a serious crime, the sending state will waive such immunity or the sending state will prosecute such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notification of diplomatic corps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary should periodically notify each foreign mission of United States policies relating to criminal offenses committed by individuals with immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the United States under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities.</p>
