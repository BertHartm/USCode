<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department of State is dependent not only on <!-- PDFPage:877 -->the contribution of Foreign Service employees but equally on the contribution of the 42 percent of the Department's employees who are employed under the Civil Service personnel system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the contribution of these Civil Service employees has been overlooked in the management of the Department and greater equality of promotion, training, and career enhancement opportunities should be accorded to the Civil Service employees of the Department; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a goal of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [22 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.] was to strengthen the contribution made by Civil Service employees of the Department of State by creating a cadre of experienced specialists and managers in the Department to provide essential continuity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Equitable reduction of budget</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State shall take all appropriate steps to assure that the burden of cuts in the budget for the Department is not imposed disproportionately or inequitably upon its Civil Service employees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of Office of the Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established in the Office of the Secretary of State the position of Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees. The position of Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees shall be a career reserved position within the Senior Executive Service. The Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees shall report directly to the Secretary of State and shall have the right to participate in all Management Council meetings to assure that the ability of the Civil Service employees to contribute to the achievement of the Department's mandated responsibilities and the career interests of those employees are adequately represented. The position of Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees shall be designated from one of the Senior Executive Service positions (as defined in section 3132(a)(2) of title 5) in existence on December 22, 1987.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Civil Service employees&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Civil Service employees&rdquo; means employees of the Federal Government except for members of the Foreign Service (as defined in section 103 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [22 U.S.C. 3903]).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established a working capital fund for the Department of State, which shall be available without fiscal year limitation, for expenses (including those authorized by the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [22 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.]) and equipment, necessary for maintenance and operation in the city of Washington and elsewhere of (1) central reproduction, editorial, data processing, audiovisual, library and administrative support services; (2) central services for supplies and equipment (including repairs); (3) such other administrative services as the Secretary, with the approval of the Office of Management and Budget, determines may be performed more advantageously and more economically as central services; and (4) medical and health care services. Such fund shall also be available without fiscal year limitation to carry out the purposes of title II of this Act [22 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.]&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2684_1_target" name="2684_1">1</a></sup> The capital of the fund shall consist of the amount of the fair and reasonable value of such supply inventories, equipment, and other assets and inventories on order, pertaining to the services to be carried on by the fund, as the Secretary may transfer to the fund, less the related liabilities and unpaid obligations, together with any appropriations made for the purpose of providing capital. The fund shall be reimbursed, or credited with advance payments, from applicable appropriations and funds of the Department of State, other Federal agencies, and other sources authorized by law, for supplies and services at rates which will approximate the expense of operations, including accrual of annual leave and depreciation of plant and equipment of the fund. The fund shall also be credited with other receipts from sale or exchange of property or in payment for loss or damage to property held by the fund. There shall be transferred into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, as of the close of each fiscal year, earnings which the Secretary determines to be excess to the needs of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charges to fund; credit to appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The current value of supplies returned to the working capital fund by a post, activity, or agency may be charged to the fund. The proceeds thereof shall, if otherwise authorized, be credited to current applicable appropriations and shall remain available for expenditures for the same purposes for which those appropriations are available. Credits may not be made to appropriations under this subsection as the result of capitalization of inventories.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the head of any Federal agency performing any foreign affairs functions (including, but not limited to, the Department of State, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the Agency for International Development) determines that administrative services performed in common by the Department of State and one or more other such agencies may be performed more advantageously and more economically on a consolidated basis, the Secretary of State and the heads of the other agencies concerned may, subject to the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, conclude an agreement which provides for the transfer to and consolidation within the Department or within one of the other agencies concerned of so much of the functions, personnel, property, records, and funds of the Department and of the other agencies concerned as may be necessary to enable the performance of those administrative services on a consolidated basis for the benefit of all agencies concerned. Agreements for consolidation of administrative services under this section shall provide for reimbursement or advances of funds from the agency receiving the service to the agency performing the service in amounts which will approximate the expense of providing administrative services for the serviced agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A Federal agency which obtains administrative services from the Department of State pursuant to an agreement authorized under subsection (a) of this section shall make full and prompt payment for such services through advance of funds or reimbursement.</p>

The Secretary shall notify a Federal agency which has not made full payment for services within 90 days after billing that services to the agency will be suspended or terminated if full payment is not made within 180 days after the date of notification. Except as provided under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall suspend or terminate services to a Federal agency which has not made full payment for services under this section 180 days after the date of notification. Any costs associated with a suspension or termination of services shall be the responsibility of, and shall be billed to, the Federal agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of State may waive the requirement for suspension or termination under paragraph (2) with respect to such services as the Secretary determines are necessary to ensure the protection of life and the safety of United States Government property.

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State may authorize and assist in the establishment, maintenance, and operation by civilian officers and employees of the Government of non-Government-operated services and facilities at posts abroad, including the furnishing of space, utilities, and properties owned or leased by the Government for use by its diplomatic, consular, and other missions and posts abroad. The provisions of the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 292&ndash;300) and section 2684 of this title may be utilized by the Secretary in providing such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Emergency commissary and mess services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may establish and maintain emergency commissary or mess services in places abroad where, in the judgment of the Secretary, such services are necessary temporarily to insure the effective and efficient performance of official duties and responsibilities. Reimbursements incident to the maintenance and operation of commissary or mess service under this subsection shall be at not less than cost as determined by the Secretary and shall be used as working funds, except that an amount equal to the amount expended for such services shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Availability; duplication of facilities and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Services and facilities established under this section shall be made available, insofar as practicable, to officers and employees of all agencies and their dependents who are stationed in the locality abroad, and, where determined by the Secretary to be appropriate due to exceptional circumstances, to United States citizens hired outside of the host country to serve as teaching staff for such dependents abroad. Such services and facilities shall not be established in localities where another agency operates similar services or facilities unless the Secretary determines that additional services or facilities are necessary. Other agencies shall to the extent practicable avoid duplicating the facilities and services provided or assisted by the Secretary under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Charges at any post abroad for a service or facility provided, authorized or assisted under this section shall be at the same rate for all civilian personnel of the Government serviced thereby, and all charges for supplies furnished to such a service or facility abroad by any agency shall be at the same rate as that charged by the furnishing agency to its comparable civilian services and facilities.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;332, &sect;2, Oct. 16, 2004, 118 Stat. 1282, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Acts of anti-Semitism in countries throughout the world, including some of the world's strongest democracies, have increased significantly in frequency and scope over the last several years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) During the last 3 months of 2003 and the first 3 months of 2004, there were numerous instances of anti-Semitic violence around the world, including the following incidents:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) In Putrajaya, Malaysia, on October 16, 2003, former Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammad told the 57 national leaders assembled for the Organization of the Islamic Conference that Jews &lsquo;rule the world by proxy&rsquo;, and called for a &lsquo;final victory&rsquo; by the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, who, he said, &lsquo;cannot be defeated by a few million Jews.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) In Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15, 2003, simultaneous car bombs exploded outside two synagogues filled with worshippers, killing 24 people and wounding more than 250 people.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) In Australia on January 5, 2004, poison was used to ignite, and burn anti-Semitic slogans into, the lawns of the Parliament House in the state of Tasmania.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) In St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 15, 2004, vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery, painting the stones with swastikas and anti-Semitic graffiti.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) In Toronto, Canada, over the weekend of March 19 through March 21, 2004, vandals attacked a Jewish school, a Jewish cemetery, and area synagogues, painting swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans on the walls of a synagogue and on residential property in a nearby, predominantly Jewish, neighborhood.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) In Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish synagogue and community center were set on fire.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Anti-Semitism in old and new forms is also increasingly emanating from the Arab and Muslim world on a sustained basis, including through books published by government-owned publishing houses in Egypt and other Arab countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In November 2002, state-run television in Egypt broadcast the anti-Semitic series entitled &lsquo;Horseman Without a Horse&rsquo;, which is based upon the fictitious conspiracy theory known as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The Protocols have been used throughout the last century by despots such as Adolf Hitler to justify violence against Jews.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-Semitic series, entitled &lsquo;Ash-Shatat&rsquo; (or &lsquo;The Diaspora&rsquo;), which depicts Jewish people hatching a plot for Jewish control of the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused international organizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate, and bring renewed focus to, the issue, including the convening by the OSCE in June 2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated solely to the issue of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The OSCE convened a conference again on April 28&ndash;29, 2004, in Berlin, to address the problem of anti-Semitism with the United States delegation led by former Mayor of New York City, Ed Koch.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The United States Government has strongly supported efforts to address anti-Semitism through bilateral relationships and interaction with international organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union, and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address the rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed resolutions expressing strong concern with the sharp escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe and calling on the Department of State to thoroughly document the phenomenon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Anti-Semitism has at times taken the form of vilification of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against Israel.&rdquo;</p>
