<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that it is the policy of the United States to promote the right of freedom of opinion and expression, including the freedom &ldquo;to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers,&rdquo; in accordance with article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that open communication of information and ideas among the peoples of the world contributes to international peace and stability, and that the promotion of such communication is in the interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that Free Europe, Incorporated, and the Radio Liberty Committee, Incorporated (commonly referred to as Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty), which have now been consolidated into RFE/RL, Incorporated, have demonstrated their effectiveness in furthering the open communication of information and ideas in Eastern Europe and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that the continuation of RFE/RL, Incorporated, as an independent broadcast media, operating in a manner not inconsistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States and in accordance with high professional standards, is in the national interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that in order to provide an effective instrumentality for the continuation of assistance to RFE/RL, Incorporated and to encourage a constructive dialog with the peoples of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Eastern Europe, and Afghanistan (until the government in Kabul is replaced by a government achieved through a free act of self-determination), it is desirable to establish a Board for International Broadcasting.</p>
