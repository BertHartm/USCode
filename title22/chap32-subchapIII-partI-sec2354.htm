<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the President determines, on a case-by-case basis, that procurement in such other country is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) to meet unforeseen circumstances, such as emergency situations, where it is important to permit procurement in a country not specified in subparagraph (A); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) to promote efficiency in the use of United States foreign assistance resources, including to avoid impairment of foreign assistance objectives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agricultural commodities or products thereof available for disposition under Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Parity for domestic commodities prior to use of funds outside United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds made available under this chapter shall be used for the procurement of any agricultural commodity or product thereof outside the United States when the domestic price of such commodity is less than parity, unless the commodity to be financed could not reasonably be procured in the United States in fulfillment of the objectives of a particular assistance program under which such commodity procurement is to be financed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Commodity eligibility</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or made available for obligation or expenditure under this chapter may be made available for the procurement of construction or engineering services from advanced developing countries, eligible under the Geographic Code 941, which have attained a competitive capability in international markets for construction services or engineering services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to an advanced developing country which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the country has its own foreign assistance programs which finance the procurement of construction or engineering services, permits United States firms to compete for those services.</p>
