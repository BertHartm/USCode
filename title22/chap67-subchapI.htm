<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) recent developments in Russia and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union present an historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful and stable international order and the integration of the independent states of the former Soviet Union into the community of democratic nations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the entire international community has a vital interest in the success of this transition, and the dimension of the problems now faced in the independent states of the former Soviet Union makes it imperative for donor countries and institutions to provide the expertise and support necessary to ensure continued progress on economic and political reforms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the United States is especially well-positioned because of its heritage and traditions to make a substantial contribution to this transition by building on current technical cooperation, medical, and food assistance programs, by assisting in the development of democratic institutions, and by fostering conditions that will encourage the United States business community to engage in trade and investment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) failure to meet the opportunities presented by these developments could threaten United States national security interests and jeopardize substantial savings in United States defense that these developments have made possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the independent states of the former Soviet Union face unprecedented environmental problems that jeopardize the quality of life and the very existence of not only their own peoples but also the peoples of other countries, and it is incumbent on the international community to assist the independent states in addressing these problems and in promoting sustainable use of resources and development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the success of United States assistance for the independent states of the former Soviet Union depends on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) effective coordination of United States efforts with similar activities of friendly and allied donor countries and of international financial institutions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reciprocal commitments by the governments of the independent states to work toward the creation of democratic institutions and an environment hospitable to foreign investment based upon the rule of law, including negotiation of bilateral and multilateral agreements on open trade and investment, adoption of commercial codes, establishment of transparency in regulatory and other governmental decision making, and timely payment of obligations carried over from previous governmental entities; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) trade and investment opportunities in the independent states of the former Soviet Union will generate employment and other economic benefits for the United States as the economies of the independent states of the former Soviet Union begin to realize their enormous potential as both customers and suppliers.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Belarus Democracy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;347, Oct. 20, 2004, 118 Stat. 1383, as amended by Pub. L. 109&ndash;480, &sect;&sect;2&ndash;4(c)(1), 5&ndash;8, Jan. 12, 2007, 120 Stat. 3666&ndash;3672, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Belarus Democracy Act of 2004&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Government of the Republic of Belarus has engaged in a pattern of clear and uncorrected violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Government of Belarus has engaged in a pattern of clear and uncorrected violations of basic principles of democratic governance, including through a series of fundamentally flawed presidential and parliamentary elections undermining the legitimacy of executive and legislative authority in that country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The most recent presidential elections in Belarus held on March 19, 2006, failed to meet the commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for democratic elections and the arbitrary use of state power and widespread detentions show a disregard for the basic rights of freedom of assembly, association, and expression, and raise doubts regarding the willingness of authorities in Belarus to tolerate political competition.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The regime of Aleksandr Lukashenka has maintained power in Belarus by orchestrating an illegal and unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new constitution, abolish the duly-elected parliament, the 13th Supreme Soviet, install a largely powerless National Assembly, extend his term of office, and remove applicable term limits.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Government of Belarus has failed to make a credible effort to solve the cases of disappeared opposition figures Yuri Zakharenka, Viktor Gonchar, and Anatoly Krasovsky in 1999 and journalist Dmitry Zavadsky in 2000, even though credible allegations and evidence exist linking top officials of the Lukashenka regime with these disappearances.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Political opposition figures Aleksandr Kozulin, Tsimafei Dranchuk, Mikalay Astreyka, Artur Finkevich, Mikalay Razumau, Katsyaryna Sadouskaya, Zmitser Dashkevich, Mikhail Marynich, Mikalay Statkevych, Pavel Sevyarinets, Andrei Klimau, Valery Levaneusky, and Siarhei Skrebets have been imprisoned or served &lsquo;corrective labor&rsquo; sentences because of their political activity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Hundreds of pro-democratic political activists have been subjected to frequent harassment and jailings, especially during, and in the aftermath of the fatally flawed March 19, 2006, presidential elections in Belarus.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Government of Belarus has attempted to maintain a monopoly over the country's information space, targeting independent media for systematic reprisals and elimination, while suppressing the right to freedom of speech and expression of those dissenting from the regime.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Belarusian authorities have perpetuated a climate of fear in Belarus by mounting a systematic crackdown on civil society through the harassment, repression, and closure of nongovernmental organizations and independent trade unions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The Lukashenka regime has increasingly subjected leaders and members of minority and unregistered religious communities to harassment, including the imposition of heavy fines, denying permission to meet for religious services, prosecutions, and jail terms for activities in the practice of their faith.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) The Belarusian authorities have further attempted to silence dissent through retribution against human rights and pro-democracy activists through threats, firings, expulsions, beatings and other forms of intimidation.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to support the aspirations of the people of the Republic of Belarus to preserve the independence and sovereignty of their country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in Belarus, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in that country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to refuse to accept the results of the fatally flawed March 19, 2006, presidential elections held in Belarus and support the call for new presidential elections;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to refuse to recognize any possible referendum, or the results of any referendum, that would affect the sovereignty of Belarus; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to work closely with other countries and international organizations, including the European Union, to promote the conditions necessary for the integration of Belarus into the European community of democracies.</p>
