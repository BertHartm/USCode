<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) recent developments in Russia and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union present an historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful and stable international order and the integration of the independent states of the former Soviet Union into the community of democratic nations;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1396 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the entire international community has a vital interest in the success of this transition, and the dimension of the problems now faced in the independent states of the former Soviet Union makes it imperative for donor countries and institutions to provide the expertise and support necessary to ensure continued progress on economic and political reforms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the United States is especially well-positioned because of its heritage and traditions to make a substantial contribution to this transition by building on current technical cooperation, medical, and food assistance programs, by assisting in the development of democratic institutions, and by fostering conditions that will encourage the United States business community to engage in trade and investment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) failure to meet the opportunities presented by these developments could threaten United States national security interests and jeopardize substantial savings in United States defense that these developments have made possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the independent states of the former Soviet Union face unprecedented environmental problems that jeopardize the quality of life and the very existence of not only their own peoples but also the peoples of other countries, and it is incumbent on the international community to assist the independent states in addressing these problems and in promoting sustainable use of resources and development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the success of United States assistance for the independent states of the former Soviet Union depends on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) effective coordination of United States efforts with similar activities of friendly and allied donor countries and of international financial institutions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reciprocal commitments by the governments of the independent states to work toward the creation of democratic institutions and an environment hospitable to foreign investment based upon the rule of law, including negotiation of bilateral and multilateral agreements on open trade and investment, adoption of commercial codes, establishment of transparency in regulatory and other governmental decision making, and timely payment of obligations carried over from previous governmental entities; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) trade and investment opportunities in the independent states of the former Soviet Union will generate employment and other economic benefits for the United States as the economies of the independent states of the former Soviet Union begin to realize their enormous potential as both customers and suppliers.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Belarus Democracy Act of 2004&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Government of Belarus has engaged in a pattern of clear and uncorrected violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Government of Belarus has engaged in a pattern of clear and uncorrected violations of basic principles of democratic governance, including through a series of fundamentally flawed presidential and parliamentary elections undermining the legitimacy of executive and legislative authority in that country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Government of Belarus has subjected thousands of pro-democratic political activists to harassment, beatings, and jailings, particularly as a result of their attempts to peacefully exercise their right to freedom of assembly and association.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Government of Belarus has attempted to maintain a monopoly over the country's information space, targeting independent media, including independent journalists, for systematic reprisals and elimination, while suppressing the right to freedom of speech and expression of those dissenting from the dictatorship of Aleksandr Lukashenka, and adopted laws restricting the media, including the Internet, in a manner inconsistent with international human rights agreements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Government of Belarus continues a systematic campaign of harassment, repression, and closure of nongovernmental organizations, including independent trade unions and entrepreneurs, and this crackdown has created a climate of fear that inhibits the development of civil society and social solidarity.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The dictator of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenka, established himself in power by orchestrating an illegal and unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new constitution, abolishing the duly elected parliament, the 13th Supreme Soviet, installing a largely powerless National Assembly, extending his term in office, and removing applicable term limits.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Government of Belarus has failed to make a convincing effort to solve the cases of disappeared opposition figures Yuri Zakharenka, Viktor Gonchar, and Anatoly Krasovsky and journalist Dmitry Zavadsky, even though credible allegations and evidence links top officials of the Government to these disappearance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The Government of Belarus has restricted freedom of expression on the Internet by requiring Internet Service Providers to maintain data on Internet users and the sites they view and to provide such data to officials upon request, and by creating a government body with the authority to require Internet Service Providers to block Web sites.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) On December 19, 2010, the Government of Belarus conducted a presidential election that failed to meet the standards of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for democratic elections.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, opposition candidates and activists have been persecuted and detainees have been physically mistreated, and denied access to family, defense counsel, medical treatment, and open legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, lawyers representing those facing criminal charges related to the post-election protest have been subjected to the revocation of licenses, disbarment, and other forms of pressure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the Government of Belarus has convicted political detainees to harsh prison sentences.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the United States expanded its visa ban list, imposed additional financial sanctions on certain state-owned enterprises, and initiated preparations to freeze the assets of several individuals in Belarus.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the United States fully restored sanctions against Belarus's largest state-owned petroleum and chemical conglomerate and all of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) After the December 19, 2010, presidential election, the United States has engaged in assistance efforts to provide legal and humanitarian assistance to those facing repression and preserving access to independent information, and has pledged resources to support human rights advocates, trade unions, youth and environmental groups, business associations, think-tanks, democratic political parties and movements, independent journalists, newspapers and electronic media operating both inside Belarus and broadcasting from its neighbors, and to support access of Belarusian students to independent higher education and expand exchange programs for business and civil society leaders.</p>
