<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Withholding of bilateral assistance and opposition to multilateral development assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Bilateral assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fifty percent of the United States assistance allocated each fiscal year in the report required by section 2413 of this title for each major illicit drug producing country or major drug-transit country shall be withheld from obligation and expenditure, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multilateral assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to vote, on and after March 1 of each year, against any loan or other utilization of the funds of their respective institution to or for any major illicit drug producing country or major drug-transit country, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;multilateral development bank&rdquo; means the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification procedure</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) What must be certified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the assistance withheld from a country pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may be obligated and expended, and the requirement of subsection (a)(2) of this section to vote against multilateral development bank assistance to a country shall not apply, if the President determines and certifies to the Congress, at the time of the submission of the report required by section 2291i(a) of this title, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during the previous year the country has cooperated fully with the United States, or has taken adequate steps on its own&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in satisfying the goals agreed to in an applicable bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States (as described in paragraph (2)) or a multilateral agreement which achieves the objectives of paragraph (2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in preventing narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances produced or processed, in whole or in part, in such country or transported through such country, from being sold illegally within the jurisdiction of such country to United States Government personnel or their dependents or from being transported, directly or indirectly, into the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in preventing and punishing the laundering in that country of drug-related profits or drug-related moneys, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in preventing and punishing bribery and other forms of public corruption which facilitate the production, processing, or shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or <!-- PDFPage:536 -->which discourage the investigation and prosecution of such acts; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a country that would not otherwise qualify for certification under subparagraph (A), the vital national interests of the United States require that the assistance withheld pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section be provided and that the United States not vote against multilateral development bank assistance for that country pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bilateral narcotics agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A bilateral narcotics agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i) is an agreement between the United States and a foreign country in which the foreign country agrees to take specific activities, including, where applicable, efforts to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reduce drug production, drug consumption, and drug trafficking within its territory, including activities to address illicit crop eradication and crop substitution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase drug interdiction and enforcement;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) where applicable, increase participation in extradition treaties, mutual legal assistance provisions directed at money laundering, sharing of evidence, and other initiatives for cooperative drug enforcement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requirement for narcotics agreement for certain countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A country which in the previous year was designated as a major illicit drug producing country or a major drug-transit country may not be determined to be cooperating fully under paragraph (1)(A) unless it has in place a bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States or a multilateral agreement which achieves the objectives of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Information to be included in certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President makes a certification with respect to a country pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), the President shall include in such certification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a full and complete description of the vital national interests placed at risk if United States bilateral assistance to that country is terminated pursuant to this section and multilateral development bank assistance is not provided to such country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a statement weighing the risk described in subparagraph (A) against the risks posed to the vital national interests of the United States by the failure of such country to cooperate fully with the United States in combating narcotics or to take adequate steps to combat narcotics on its own.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Licit opium producing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President may make a certification under paragraph (1)(A) with respect to a major illicit drug producing country, or major drug-transit country, that is a producer of licit opium only if the President determines that such country has taken adequate steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit cultivation and production into the illicit market, maintains production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand, and prevents illicit cultivation and production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Matters to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether to make the certification required by subsection (b) of this section with respect to a country, the President shall consider the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Have the actions of the government of that country resulted in the maximum reductions in illicit drug production which were determined to be achievable pursuant to section 2291i(a)(2)(D) of this title? In the case of a major illicit drug producing country, the President shall give foremost consideration, in determining whether to make the determination required by subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, to whether the government of that country has taken actions which have resulted in such reductions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement measures to enforce in its territory, to the maximum extent possible, the elimination of illicit cultivation and the suppression of illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, as evidenced by seizures of such drugs and substances and of illicit laboratories and the arrest and prosecution of violators involved in the traffic in such drugs and substances significantly affecting the United States?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, the laundering in that country of drug-related profits or drug-related moneys, as evidenced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the enactment and enforcement by that government of laws prohibiting such conduct;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that government entering into, and cooperating under the terms of, mutual legal assistance agreements with the United States governing (but not limited to) money laundering; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the degree to which that government otherwise cooperates with United States law enforcement authorities on anti-money laundering efforts?</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, bribery and other forms of public corruption which facilitate the illicit production, processing, or shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or which discourage the investigation and prosecution of such acts, as evidenced by the enactment and enforcement of laws prohibiting such conduct?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Has that government, as a matter of government policy or practice, encouraged or facilitated the illicit production or distribution of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?</p>
<!-- PDFPage:537 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Does any senior official of that government engage in, encourage, or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Has that government investigated aggressively all cases in which any member of an agency of the United States Government engaged in drug enforcement activities has been the victim, since January 1, 1985, of acts or threats of violence, inflicted by or with the complicity of any law enforcement or other officer of such country or any political subdivision thereof, and energetically sought to bring the perpetrators of such offense or offenses to justice?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Having been requested to do so by the United States Government, does that government fail to provide reasonable cooperation to lawful activities of United States drug enforcement agents, including the refusal of permission to such agents engaged in interdiction of aerial smuggling into the United States to pursue suspected aerial smugglers a reasonable distance into the airspace of the requested country?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Has that government made necessary changes in legal codes in order to enable law enforcement officials to move more effectively against narcotics traffickers, such as new conspiracy laws and new asset seizure laws?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Has that government expeditiously processed United States extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Has that government refused to protect or give haven to any known drug traffickers, and has it expeditiously processed extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking made by other countries?</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Congressional review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (e) of this section shall apply if, within 45 days of continuous session (within the meaning of section 601(b)(1) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976) after receipt of a certification under subsection (b) of this section, the Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the determination of the President contained in such certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Denial of assistance for countries decertified</h4>
