<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) drought and famine have caused countless deaths and untold suffering among the people of sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) drought and famine in combination with other factors such as desertification, government neglect of the agricultural sector, and inappropriate economic policies have severely affected long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the most cost-effective and efficient way of overcoming Africa's vulnerability to drought and famine is to address Africa's long-term development needs through a process that builds upon the needs and capabilities of the African people, promotes sustained and equitable economic growth, preserves the environment, and protects the rights of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority to furnish assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to furnish project and program assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine in accordance with the policies contained in this section, for long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose of assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of assistance under this section shall be to help the poor majority of men and women in sub-Saharan Africa to participate in a process of long-term development through economic growth that is equitable, participatory, environmentally sustainable, and self-reliant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of assistance to encourage private sector development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Assistance under this section should, in a manner consistent with paragraph (1), be used to promote sustained economic growth, encourage private sector development, promote individual initiatives, and help to reduce the role of central governments in areas more appropriate for the private sector.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except to the extent inconsistent with this section&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Private and voluntary organizations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Agency for International Development shall take into account the local-level perspectives of the rural and urban poor in sub-Saharan Africa, including women, during the planning process for project and program assistance under this section. In order to gain that perspective the Agency for International Development should consult closely with African, United States, and other private and voluntary organizations that have demonstrated effectiveness in or commitment to the promotion of local, grassroots activities on behalf of long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa as described in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &ldquo;Private and voluntary organization&rdquo; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The activities described in subsection (i)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Effective use of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance provided under this section shall be concentrated in countries which will make the most effective use of such assistance in order to fulfill the purpose specified in subsection (c) of this section, especially those countries (including those of the Sahel region) having the greatest need for outside assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Promotion of regional integration</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Relation to other authorities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Assistance under other authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority granted by this section to provide assistance for long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa is not intended to preclude the use of other authorities for that purpose.
