<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) On October 1, 1979, the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish and thereafter shall maintain in the Treasury a fund to be known as the &lsquo;Panama Canal Emergency Fund&rsquo;.

Any withdrawal from such Fund to cover increased costs attributable to unprogrammed increases in traffic may not be made in amounts greater than the revenues from such increased traffic. Such Fund shall not be available for payments to Panama under Article XIII of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. Any withdrawal from such fund or expenditure made under this subsection shall be reported forthwith by the Commission to the Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget.&rdquo;</p>
