<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of security and loyalty requirements, restrictions, and safeguards; investigation of personnel; standards of clearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall establish such security and loyalty requirements, restrictions, and safeguards as he deems necessary in the interest of the national security and to carry out the provisions of this chapter. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Director shall arrange with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management for the conduct of full-field background security and loyalty investigations of all the Agency's officers, employees, consultants, persons detailed from other Government agencies, members of its General Advisory Committee, advisory boards, contractors, and subcontractors, and their officers and employees, actual or prospective. In the case of persons detailed from other Government agencies or employed directly from other Government agencies, the Director may accept the results of full-field background security and loyalty investigations conducted by such agencies as the basis for the determination required by this subsection that the person is not a security risk or of doubtful loyalty. In the event the investigation discloses information indicating that the person investigated may be or may become a security risk, or may be of doubtful loyalty, the report of the investigation shall be turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a full-field investigation. The final results of all such investigations shall be turned over to the Director for final determination. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, no person shall be permitted to enter on duty as such an officer, employee, consultant, or member of advisory committee or board, or pursuant to any such detail, and no contractor or subcontractor, or officer or employee thereof shall be permitted to have access to any classified information, until he shall have been investigated in accordance with this subsection and the report of such investigations made to the Director, and the Director shall have determined that such person is not a security risk or of doubtful loyalty. Standards applicable with respect to the security clearance of persons within any category re<!-- PDFPage:739 -->ferred to in this subsection shall not be less stringent, and the investigation of such persons for such purposes shall not be less intensive or complete, than in the case of such clearance of persons in a corresponding category under the security procedures of the Government agency or agencies having the highest security restrictions with respect to persons in such category.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acceptance of investigation and clearance granted by other Government agencies to contractor personnel; access to confidential information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of contractors or subcontractors and their officers or employees, actual or prospective, the Director may accept, in lieu of the investigation prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, a report of investigation conducted by a Government agency, other than the Director of the Office of Personnel Management or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, when it is determined by the Director that the completed investigation meets the standards established in subsection (a) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That security clearance had been granted to the individual concerned by another Government agency based upon such investigation and report. The Director may also grant access for information classified no higher than &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; to contractors or subcontractors and their officers and employees, actual or prospective, on the basis of reports on less than full-field investigations: <em>Provided</em>, That such investigations shall each include a current national agency check. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Director may also grant access to classified information to contractors or subcontractors and their officers and employees, actual or prospective, on the basis of a security clearance granted by the Department of Defense, or any agency thereof, to the individual concerned; except that any access to Restricted Data shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Atomic Energy Commission Restricted Data; access; personnel security procedures and standards of Commission and Agency; interim clearance; exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Atomic Energy Commission may authorize any of its employees, or employees of any contractor, prospective contractor, licensee, or prospective licensee of the Atomic Energy Commission or any other person authorized to have access to Restricted Data by the Atomic Energy Commission under section 2165 of title 42, to permit the Director or any officer, employee, consultant, person detailed from other Government agencies, member of the General Advisory Committee or of an advisory board established pursuant to section 2581(f) of this title, contractor, subcontractor, prospective contractor, or prospective subcontractor, or officer or employee of such contractor, subcontractor, prospective contractor, or prospective subcontractor, to have access to Restricted Data which is required in the performance of his duties and so certified by the Director, but only if (1) the Atomic Energy Commission has determined, in accordance with the established personnel security procedures and standards of the Commission, that permitting such individual to have access to such Restricted Data will not endanger the common defense and security, and (2) the Atomic Energy Commission finds that the established personnel and other security procedures and standards of the Agency are adequate and in reasonable conformity to the standards established by the Atomic Energy Commission under section 2165 of title 42, including those for interim clearance in subsection (b) thereof. Any individual granted access to such Restricted Data pursuant to this subsection may exchange such data with any individual who (A) is an officer or employee of the Department of Defense, or any department or agency thereof, or a member of the Armed Forces, or an officer or employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or a contractor or subcontractor of any such department, agency, or armed force, or an officer or employee of any such contractor or subcontractor, and (B) has been authorized to have access to Restricted Data under the provisions of sections 2163 or 2455 of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of required investigation and determination with respect to consultants; procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The investigations and determination required under subsection (a) of this section may be waived by the Director in the case of any consultant who will not be permitted to have access to classified information if the Director determines and certifies in writing that such waiver is in the best interests of the United States.</p>
