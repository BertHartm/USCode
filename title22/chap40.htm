<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) international expositions, when properly organized, financed, and executed, have a significant impact on the economic growth of the region surrounding the exposition and, under appropriate international sanction, are important instruments of national policy, particularly in the exchange of ideas and the demonstration of cultural achievements between peoples;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) in view of the widely varying circumstances under which international expositions have developed in the United States, the different degrees to which the Federal Government has assisted and participated in such expositions, and the increasing number of proposals for future expositions, the national interest requires that Federal action concerning such expositions be given orderly consideration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) such orderly consideration is best achieved by the development of uniform standards, criteria, and procedures to establish the conditions under which the Government hereafter will (A) recognize international expositions proposed to be held in the United States, and (B) take part in such expositions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any international exposition proposed to be held in the United States shall be eligible on application from its sponsors to receive the recognition of the Federal Government upon a finding of the President that recognition will be in the national interest. In making such a finding the President shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a report by the Secretary of Commerce which shall include (A) an evaluation of purposes and reasons for the exposition, and (B) a determination that guaranteed financial and other support has been secured by the exposition from affected State and local governments and from business and civic leadership of the region and others in amounts sufficient in his judgment to assure the successful development and progress of the exposition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a report by the Secretary of State that the proposed exposition qualifies for consideration of registration by the Bureau of International Expositions (hereafter referred to as BIE); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such other evidence as the President may consider to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recognition and registration procedure; compliance with international convention; participation by States and foreign governments</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional authorization; proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Government may participate in an international exposition proposed to be held in the United States only upon the authorization of the Congress. If the President finds that Federal participation is in the national interest, he shall transmit to the Congress his proposal for such participation, which proposal shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) evidence that the international exposition has met the criteria for Federal recognition and, pursuant to section 2802 of this title, it has been so recognized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a statement that the international exposition has been registered by the BIE; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a plan prepared by the Secretary of Commerce in cooperation with other interested departments and agencies of the Federal Government for Federal participation in the exposition. The Secretary of Commerce shall include in such plan any documentation described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, <!-- PDFPage:876 -->a rendering of any design described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section, and any recommendation based on the determination under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction of Federal pavilion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In developing a plan under subsection (a)(3) of this section the Secretary of Commerce shall consider whether the plan should include the construction of a Federal pavilion. If the Secretary of Commerce determines that a Federal pavilion should be constructed, he shall request the Administrator of General Services (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;) to determine, in consultation with such Secretary, whether there is a federally endorsed need for a permanent structure in the area of the exposition. If the Administrator determines that any such need exists&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Administrator shall fully document such determination, including the identification of the need, and shall transmit such documentation to the Secretary of Commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Administrator, shall design a pavilion which satisfies the federally endorsed needs for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) participation in the exposition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) permanent use of such pavilion after the termination of participation in the exposition; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary of Commerce shall determine whether the Federal Government should be deeded a satisfactory site for the Federal pavilion in fee simple, free of all liens and encumbrances, as a condition of participation in the exposition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Administrator determines that no design of a Federal pavilion will satisfy both needs described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall design a temporary Federal pavilion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations for Federal pavilion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The enactment of a specific authorization of appropriations shall be required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to construct a Federal pavilion in accordance with the plan prepared pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Federal pavilion is not temporary, to modify such Federal pavilion after termination of participation in the exposition if modification is necessary to adapt such pavilion for use by the Federal Government to satisfy a need described in subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the Federal pavilion is temporary, to dismantle, demolish, or otherwise dispose of such Federal pavilion after termination of Federal participation in the exposition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requisites and temporary nature of Federal pavilion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a Federal pavilion shall be considered to satisfy both needs described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section if the Federal pavilion which satisfies the needs described in paragraph (1)(B)(i) of such subsection can be modified after completion of the exposition to satisfy the needs described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of such subsection, provided that such modification shall cost no more than the expense of demolition, dismantling, or other disposal, or if the cost is higher, it shall be no more than 50 per centum of the original cost of the construction of the pavilion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a Federal pavilion is temporary if the Federal pavilion is designed to satisfy the minimum needs of the Federal Government described in subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section and is intended for disposal by the Federal Government after the termination of participation in the exposition.</p>
