<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may transfer nonlethal excess defense articles under this section only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the equipment is drawn from existing stocks of the Department of Defense;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the President determines that transferring the articles under the authority of this section is preferable to selling them, after taking into account the potential proceeds from, and likelihood of, such sales, and the comparative foreign policy benefits that may accrue to the United States as the result of either a transfer or sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the President first considers the effects of the transfer of the excess defense articles on the national technology and industrial base, particularly the extent, if any, to which the transfer reduces the opportunities of entities in the national technology and industrial base to sell new equipment to the country or countries to which the excess defense articles are transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notification to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall notify the Committees on Appropriations, Armed Services, and Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committees on Appropriations, Armed Services, and Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives fifteen days before transferring nonlethal excess defense articles under subsection (a) of this section, in accordance with the regular notification procedures of those committees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Section 2392(d) of this title shall not apply with respect to transfers of nonlethal excess defense articles under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Annual report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Commencing in 1991, not later than December 15 of each year, the President shall transmit to the committees described in subsection (c) of this section a report with respect to the previous fiscal year which contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a list of the countries to which the President has furnished nonlethal excess defense articles under the authority of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of the excess nonlethal defense articles that were furnished to each such country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transportation and related costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), funds available to the Department of Defense shall not be expended for crating, packing, handling and transportation of nonlethal excess defense articles transferred under the authority of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 2392(d) of this title or any other provision of law, the President may direct the crating, packing, handling and transport of nonlethal excess defense articles without charge to a country if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that country has an agreement providing the United States with base rights in that country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that country is eligible for assistance from the International Development Association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the nonlethal excess defense articles are being provided to that country under the authority of this section.</p>
