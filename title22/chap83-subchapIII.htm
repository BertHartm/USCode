<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to funds available under section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)) for such purpose or under any other provision of that Act [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], there are authorized to be appropriated to the President, from amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title, such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to carry out section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as added by subsection (a) [22 U.S.C. 2151b&ndash;2].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Availability of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Allocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by paragraph (1) for the fiscal years 2004 through 2008, such sums as may be necessary are authorized to be appropriated to carry out section 104A(d)(4) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by subsection (a)) [22 U.S.C. 2151b&ndash;2(d)(4)], relating to the procurement and distribution of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Relationship to assistance programs to enhance nutrition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In recognition of the fact that malnutrition may hasten the progression of HIV to AIDS and may exacerbate the decline among AIDS patients leading to a shorter life span, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall, as appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) integrate nutrition programs with HIV/AIDS activities, generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide, as a component of an anti-retroviral therapy program, support for food and nutrition to individuals infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide support for food and nutrition for children affected by HIV/AIDS and to communities and households caring for children affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An organization that is otherwise eligible to receive assistance under section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by subsection (a)) [22 U.S.C. 2151b&ndash;2] or under any other provision of this chapter (or any amendment made by this chapter) to prevent, treat, or monitor HIV/AIDS shall not be required, as a condition of receiving the assistance, to endorse or utilize a multisectoral approach to combatting HIV/AIDS, or to endorse, utilize, or participate in a prevention method or treatment program to which the organization has a religious or moral objection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to preclude the provision to individuals of palliative care, treatment, or post-exposure pharmaceutical prophylaxis, and necessary pharmaceuticals and commodities, including test kits, condoms, and, when proven effective, microbicides.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, except that this subsection shall not apply to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or to any United Nations agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sense of Congress relating to food assistance for individuals living with HIV/AIDS</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The United States provides more than 60 percent of all food assistance worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) According to the United Nations World Food Program and other United Nations agencies, food insecurity of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS is a major problem in countries with large populations of such individuals, particularly in African countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Although the United States is willing to provide food assistance to these countries in need, a few of the countries object to part or all of the assistance because of fears of benign genetic modifications to the foods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Healthy and nutritious foods for individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS are an important complement to HIV/AIDS medicines for such individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Individuals infected with HIV have higher nutritional requirements than indi<!-- PDFPage:1569 -->viduals who are not infected with HIV, particularly with respect to the need for protein. Also, there is evidence to suggest that the full benefit of therapy to treat HIV/AIDS may not be achieved in individuals who are malnourished, particularly in pregnant and lactating women.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is therefore the sense of Congress that United States food assistance should be accepted by countries with large populations of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS, particularly African countries, in order to help feed such individuals.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7651. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Approximately 2,000 children around the world are infected each day with HIV through mother-to-child transmission. Transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor, and delivery or through breast feeding. Over 90 percent of these cases are in developing nations with little or no access to public health facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Mother-to-child transmission is largely preventable with the proper application of pharmaceuticals, therapies, and other public health interventions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Certain antiretroviral drugs reduce mother-to-child transmission by nearly 50 percent. Universal availability of this drug could prevent up to 400,000 infections per year and dramatically reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) At the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June 2001, the United States committed to the specific goals with respect to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, including the goals of reducing the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20 percent by the year 2005 and by 50 percent by the year 2010, as specified in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the Special Session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Several United States Government agencies including the United States Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control are already supporting programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission in resource-poor nations and have the capacity to expand these programs rapidly by working closely with foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission can provide the basis for a broader response that includes care and treatment of mothers, fathers, and other family members who are infected with HIV or living with AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) HIV/AIDS has devastated the lives of countless children and families across the globe. Since the epidemic began, an estimated 13,200,000 children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by AIDS, that is they have lost their mother or both parents to the disease. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that this number will double by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) HIV/AIDS also targets young people between the ages of 15 to 24, particularly young women, many of whom carry the burden of caring for family members living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 10,300,000 young people are now living with HIV/AIDS. One-half of all new infections are occurring among this age group.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Government's response to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic should place high priority on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the care and treatment of family members and caregivers, and the care of children orphaned by AIDS. To the maximum extent possible, the United States Government should seek to leverage its funds by seeking matching contributions from the private sector, other national governments, and international organizations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The 5-year United States Government strategy required by section 7611 of this title shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1572 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide for meeting or exceeding the goal to reduce the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 20 percent by 2005 and by 50 percent by 2010;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) include programs to make available testing and treatment to HIV-positive women and their family members, including drug treatment and therapies to prevent mother-to-child transmission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expand programs designed to care for children orphaned by AIDS.</p>
