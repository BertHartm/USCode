<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) drought and famine have caused countless deaths and untold suffering among the people of sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) drought and famine in combination with other factors such as desertification, government neglect of the agricultural sector, and inappropriate economic policies have severely affected long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the most cost-effective and efficient way of overcoming Africa's vulnerability to drought and famine is to address Africa's long-term development needs through a process that builds upon the needs and capabilities of the African people, promotes sustained and equitable economic growth, preserves the environment, and protects the rights of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority to furnish assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to furnish project and program assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine in accordance with the policies contained in this section, for long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;385, &sect;2, Nov. 13, 1998, 112 Stat. 3460, provided that:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:611 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The economic, security, and humanitarian interests of the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa would be enhanced by sustainable, broad-based agricultural and rural development in each of the African nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of undernourished people in Africa has more than doubled, from approximately 100,000,000 in the late 1960s to 215,000,000 in 1998, and is projected to increase to 265,000,000 by the year 2010. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the term &lsquo;under nutrition&rsquo; means inadequate consumption of nutrients, often adversely affecting children's physical and mental development, undermining their future as productive and creative members of their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Currently, agricultural production in Africa employs about two-thirds of the workforce but produces less than one-fourth of the gross domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank Group.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) African women produce up to 80 percent of the total food supply in Africa according to the International Food Policy Research Institute.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) An effective way to improve conditions of the poor is to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. Productivity increases can be fostered by increasing research and education in agriculture and rural development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In November 1996, the World Food Summit set a goal of reducing hunger worldwide by 50 percent by the year 2015 and encouraged national governments to develop domestic food plans and to support international aid efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Although the World Bank Group recently has launched a major initiative to support agricultural and rural development, only 10 percent, or $1,200,000,000, of its total lending to sub-Saharan Africa for fiscal years 1993 to 1997 was devoted to agriculture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) United States food processing and agricultural sectors benefit greatly from the liberalization of global trade and increased exports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Africa represents a growing market for United States food and agricultural products. Africa's food imports are projected to rise from less than 8,000,000 metric tons in 1990 to more than 25,000,000 metric tons by the [sic] 2020.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9)(A) Increased private sector investment in African countries and expanded trade between the United States and Africa can greatly help African countries achieve food self-sufficiency and graduate from dependency on international assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Development assistance, technical assistance, and training can facilitate and encourage commercial development in Africa, such as improving rural roads, agricultural research and extension, and providing access to credit and other resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) Several United States private voluntary organizations have demonstrated success in empowering Africans through direct business ownership and helping African agricultural producers more efficiently and directly market their products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Rural business associations, owned and controlled by farmer shareholders, also greatly help agricultural producers to increase their household incomes.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Declaration of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States, consistent with title XII of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [probably means title XII of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. 2220a et seq.], to support governments of sub-Saharan African countries, United States and African nongovernmental organizations, universities, businesses, and international agencies, to help ensure the availability of basic nutrition and economic opportunities for individuals in sub-Saharan Africa, through sustainable agriculture and rural development.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) shall solicit and take into consideration the views and needs of intended beneficiaries and program participants during the selection, planning, implementation, and evaluation phases of projects;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) shall ensure that programs are designed and conducted in cooperation with African and United States organizations and institutions, such as private and voluntary organizations, cooperatives, land-grant and other appropriate universities, and local producer-owned cooperative marketing and buying associations, that have expertise in addressing the needs of the poor, small-scale farmers, entrepreneurs, and rural workers, including women.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of the Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of the Congress that, if there is an increase in funding for sub-Saharan programs, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should proportionately increase resources to the Africa Food Security Initiative, or any comparable or successor program, for fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years in order to meet the needs of the countries participating in such Initiative.</p>
