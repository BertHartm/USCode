<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), the actual value of a naval vessel of 3,000 tons or less and 20 years or more of age shall be considered to be not less than the greater of the scrap value or fair value (including conversion costs) of such vessel, as determined by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided by subsection (d) of this section, payment shall be made in advance or, if the President determines it to be in the national interest, upon delivery of the defense article or rendering of the defense service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Personnel performing defense services sold as prohibited from performing combat activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Personnel performing defense services sold under this chapter may not perform any duties of a combatant nature, including any duties related to training and advising that may engage United States personnel in combat activities, outside the United States in connection with the performance of those defense services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within forty-eight hours of the existence of, or a change in status of significant hostilities or terrorist acts or a series of such acts, which may endanger American lives or property, involving a country in which United States personnel are performing defense services pursuant to this chapter or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the President pro tempore of the Senate a report, in writing, classified if necessary, setting forth&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Billings; interest after due date, rates of interest and extension of due date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President determines it to be in the national interest pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, billings for sales made under letters of offer issued under this section after June 30, 1976, may be dated and issued upon delivery of the defense article or rendering of the defense service and shall be due and payable upon receipt thereof by the purchasing country or international organization. Interest shall be charged on any net amount due and payable which is not paid within sixty days after the date of such billing. The rate of interest charged shall be a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding short-term obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the billing and shall be computed from the date of billing. The President may extend such sixty-day period to one hundred and twenty days if he determines that emergency requirements of the purchaser for acquisition of such defense articles or defense services exceed the ready availability to the purchaser of funds sufficient to pay the United States in full for them within such sixty-day period and submits that determination to the Congress together with a special emergency request for the authorization and appropriation of additional funds to finance such purchases under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Charges; reduction or waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After September 30, 1976, letters of offer for the sale of defense articles or for the sale of defense services that are issued pursuant to this section or pursuant to section 2762 of this title shall include appropriate charges for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) administrative services, calculated on an average percentage basis to recover the full estimated costs (excluding a pro rata share of fixed base operation costs) of administration of sales made under this chapter to all purchasers of such articles and services as specified in section 2792(b) of this title and section 2792(c) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a proportionate amount of any nonrecurring costs of research, development, and production of major defense equipment (except for equipment wholly paid for either from funds transferred under section 503(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2311(a)(3)] or from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis under section 2763 of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the recovery of ordinary inventory losses associated with the sale from stock of defense articles that are being stored at the expense of the purchaser of such articles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The President may reduce or waive the charge or charges which would otherwise be considered appropriate under paragraph (1)(B) for particular sales that would, if made, significantly advance United States Government interests in North Atlantic Treaty Organization standardization, standardization with the Armed Forces of Japan, Australia, or New Zealand in furtherance of the mutual defense treaties between the United States and those countries, or foreign procurement in the United States under coproduction arrangements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The President may waive the charge or charges which would otherwise be considered appropriate under paragraph (1)(B) for a particular sale if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) imposition of the charge or charges likely would result in the loss of the sale; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:902 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a sale of major defense equipment that is also being procured for the use of the Armed Forces, the waiver of the charge or charges would (through a resulting increase in the total quantity of the equipment purchased from the source of the equipment that causes a reduction in the unit cost of the equipment) result in a savings to the United States on the cost of the equipment procured for the use of the Armed Forces that substantially offsets the revenue foregone by reason of the waiver of the charge or charges.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The President may waive, for particular sales of major defense equipment, any increase in a charge or charges previously considered appropriate under paragraph (1)(B) if the increase results from a correction of an estimate (reasonable when made) of the production quantity base that was used for calculating the charge or charges for purposes of such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The President may waive the charges for administrative services that would otherwise be required by paragraph (1)(A) in connection with any sale to the Maintenance and Supply Agency of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in support of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a weapon system partnership agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a NATO/SHAPE project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Defense may reimburse the fund established to carry out section 2792(b) of this title in the amount of the charges waived under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Any such reimbursement may be made from any funds available to the Department of Defense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;weapon system partnership agreement&rdquo; means an agreement between two or more member countries of the Maintenance and Supply Agency of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) is entered into pursuant to the terms of the charter of that organization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is for the common logistic support of a specific weapon system common to the participating countries; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &ldquo;NATO/SHAPE project&rdquo; means a common-funded project supported by allocated credits from North Atlantic Treaty Organization bodies or by host nations with NATO Infrastructure funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public inspection of contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracts entered into between the United States and a foreign country under the authority of this section or section 2762 of this title shall be prepared in a manner which will permit them to be made available for public inspection to the fullest extent possible consistent with the national security of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) North Atlantic Treaty Organization standardization agreements, similar agreements; reimbursement for costs; transmittal to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may enter into North Atlantic Treaty Organization standardization agreements in carrying out section 814 of the Act of October 7, 1975 (Public Law 94&ndash;106), and may enter into similar agreements with countries which are major non-NATO allies, for the cooperative furnishing of training on bilateral or multilateral basis, if the financial principles of such agreements are based on reciprocity. Such agreements shall include reimbursement for all direct costs but may exclude reimbursement for indirect costs, administrative surcharges, and costs of billeting of trainees (except to the extent that members of the United States Armed Forces occupying comparable accommodations are charged for such accommodations by the United States). Each such agreement shall be transmitted promptly to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Appropriations, Armed Services, and Foreign Relations of the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Reciprocal quality assurance, inspection, contract administrative services, and contract audit defense services; catalog data and services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in connection with the placement or administration of any contract or subcontract for defense articles, defense services, or design and construction services pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment program in accordance with an agreement under which the foreign governments participating in such program provide such services, without charge, in connection with similar contracts or subcontracts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out the objectives of this section, the President is authorized to provide cataloging data and cataloging services, without charge, to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or to any member government of that Organization if that Organization or member government provides such data and services in accordance with an agreement on a reciprocal basis, without charge, to the United States Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Sales affecting combat readiness of Armed Forces; statement to Congress; limitation on delivery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Sales of defense articles and defense services which could have significant adverse effect on the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be kept to an absolute minimum. The President shall transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations of the Senate on the same day a written statement giving a complete explanation with respect to any proposal to sell, under this section or under authority of subchapter II&ndash;B of <!-- PDFPage:903 -->this chapter, any defense articles or defense services if such sale could have a significant adverse effect on the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of the United States.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of President; dependable undertaking by foreign country or international organization; interest rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the President may, without requirement for charge to any appropriation or contract authorization otherwise provided, enter into contracts for the procurement of defense articles or defense services for sale for United States dollars to any foreign country or international organization if such country or international organization provides the United States Government with a dependable undertaking (1) to pay the full amount of such contract which will assure the United States Government against any loss on the contract, and (2) to make funds available in such amounts and at such times as may be required to meet the payments required by the contract, and any damages and costs that may accrue from the cancellation of such contract, in advance of the time such payments, damages, or costs are due. Interest shall be charged on any net amount by which any such country or international organization is in arrears under all of its outstanding unliquidated dependable <!-- PDFPage:906 -->undertakings, considered collectively. The rate of interest charged shall be a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding short-term obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the net arrearage and shall be computed from the date of net arrearage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of letters of offer under emergency determination; availability of appropriations for payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may, if he determines it to be in the national interest, issue letters of offer under this section which provide for billing upon delivery of the defense article or rendering of the defense service and for payment within one hundred and twenty days after the date of billing. This authority may be exercised, however, only if the President also determines that the emergency requirements of the purchaser for acquisition of such defense articles and services exceed the ready availability to the purchaser of funds sufficient to make payments on a dependable undertaking basis and submits both determinations to the Congress together with a special emergency request for authorization and appropriation of additional funds to finance such purchases under this chapter. Appropriations available to the Department of Defense may be used to meet the payments required by the contracts for the procurement of defense articles and defense services and shall be reimbursed by the amounts subsequently received from the country or international organization to whom articles or services are sold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicability of Renegotiation Act of 1951</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of the Renegotiation Act of 1951 [50 App. U.S.C. 1211 et seq.] do not apply to procurement contracts heretofore or hereafter entered into under this section, section 2769 of this title, or predecessor provisions of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Competitive pricing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Procurement contracts made in implementation of sales under this section for defense articles and defense services wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis shall be priced on the same costing basis with regard to profit, overhead, independent research and development, bid and proposal, and other costing elements, as is applicable to procurements of like items purchased by the Department of Defense for its own use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Direct costs associated with meeting additional or unique requirements of the purchaser shall be allowable under contracts described in paragraph (1). Loadings applicable to such direct costs shall be permitted at the same rates applicable to procurement of like items purchased by the Department of Defense for its own use.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement of findings and policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that security assistance surveys prepared by the United States for foreign countries have had a significant impact on subsequent military procurement decisions of those countries. It is the policy of the United States that the results of security assistance surveys conducted by the United States clearly do not represent a commitment by the United States to provide any military equipment to any foreign country. Further, recommendations in such surveys should be consistent with the arms export control policy provided for in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As part of the quarterly report required by section 2776(a) of this title, the President shall include a list of all security assistance surveys authorized during the preceding calendar quarter, specifying the country with respect to which the survey was or will be conducted, the purpose of the survey, and the number of United States Government personnel who participated or will participate in the survey.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Submission of surveys to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon a request of the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives or the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, the President shall submit to that committee copies of security assistance surveys conducted by United States Government personnel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Security assistance surveys&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;security assistance surveys&rdquo; means any survey or study conducted in a foreign country by United States Government personnel for the purpose of assessing the needs of that country for security assistance, and includes defense requirement surveys, site surveys, general surveys or studies, and engineering assessment surveys.</p>
