<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a)(1) Congress finds that the Government of Portugal's recognition of the right to independence of the African territories of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau marks a significant advance toward the goal of self-determination for all the peoples of Africa, without which peace on the continent is not secure.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Congress finds that progress toward independence for the Portuguese African territories will have a significant impact on the international organizations and the community of nations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Congress commends the Portuguese Government's initiatives on these fronts as evidence of a reaffirmation of that Government's support for her obligations under both the United Nations Charter and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Therefore, Congress calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to take the following actions designed to make clear United States support for a peaceful and orderly transition to independence in the Portuguese African territories:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) An official statement should be issued of United States support for the independence of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, and of our desire to have good relations with the future governments of the countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) It should be made clear to the Government of of Portugal that we view the efforts toward a peaceful and just settlement of the conflict in the African territories as consistent with Portugal's obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization partnership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The United States should encourage United Nations support for a peaceful transition to independence, negotiated settlement of all differences, and the protection of human rights of all citizens of the three territories.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States should open a dialog with potential leaders of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau and assure them of our commitment to their genuine political and economic independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The economic development needs of the three territories will be immense when independence is achieved. Therefore, it is urged that the United States Agency for International Development devote attention to assessing the economic situation in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau and be ready to cooperate with the future governments in providing the kind of assistance that will help make their independence viable. In addition, the United States Government should take the initiative among other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, in seeking significant contribution of development assistance for the three territories.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In light of the need of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau for skilled and educated manpower, a priority consideration should be given to expanding current United States programs of educational assistance to the territories as a timely and substantive contribution to their independence.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Multilateral programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that the planning and administration of development assistance by, or under the sponsorship of the United Nations, multilateral lending institutions, and other multilateral organizations may contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of that assistance through participation of other donors in the development effort, improved coordination of policies and programs, pooling of knowledge, avoidance of duplication of facilities and manpower, and greater encouragement of self-help performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regional programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further the sense of the Congress (1) that where problems or opportunities are common to two or more countries in a region, in such fields as agriculture, education, transportation, communications, power, watershed development, disease control, and establishment of development banks, these countries often can more effectively resolve such problems and exploit such opportunities by joining together in regional organizations or working together on regional programs, (2) that assistance often can be utilized more efficiently in regional programs than in separate country programs, and (3) that to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this chapter assistance under this chapter should be furnished so as to encourage less developed countries to cooperate with each other in regional development programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federal funds to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations for loans to foreign countries; increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should increase, to the extent practicable, the funds provided by the United States to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations in which the United States participates for use by such institutions and organizations in making loans to foreign countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of funds; use of international or multilateral lending organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In furtherance of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any funds appropriated under subchapter I of this chapter may be transferred by the President to the International Development Association, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the Asian Development Bank or other multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations in which the United States participates for the purpose of providing funds to enable any such institution or organization to make loans to foreign countries.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 93&ndash;559, &sect;55(a), Dec. 30, 1974, 88 Stat. 1819, provided that: &ldquo;The United Nations has designated thirty-two countries as &lsquo;Most Seriously Affected&rsquo; by the current economic crisis. These are countries without the internal food production capability or the foreign exchange availability to secure food to meet their immediate food requirements. The Congress calls upon the President and Secretary of State to take the following actions designed to mobilize appropriate resources to meet the food emergency:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Review and make appropriate adjustments in the level of programming of our food and fertilizer assistance programs with the aim of increasing to the maximum extent feasible the volume of food and fertilizer available to those countries most seriously affected by current food shortages.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Call upon all traditional and potential new donors of food, fertilizer, or the means of financing these commodities to immediately increase their participation in efforts to address the emergency food needs of the developing world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Make available to these most seriously affected countries the maximum feasible volume of food commodities, with appropriate regard to the current domestic price and supply situations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Maintain regular and full consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress and report to the Congress and the Nation on steps which are being taken to help meet this food emergency. In accordance with this provision, the President shall report to the Congress on a global assessment of food needs for fiscal year 1975, specifying expected food grain deficits and currently planned programming of food assistance, and steps which are being taken to encourage other countries to increase their participation in food assistance or the financing of food assistance. Such report should reach the Congress promptly and should be supplemented quarterly for the remainder of fiscal year 1975.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Congress directs that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, not more than 30 percent of concessional food aid should be allocated to countries other than those which are most seriously affected by current food shortages, unless the President demonstrates to the appropriate Committees of the Congress that the use of such food assistance is solely for humanitarian food purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Congress calls upon the President to proceed with the implementation of resolutions and recommendations adopted by the World Food Conference. The Congress believes that it is incumbent upon the United States to take a leading role in assisting in the development of a viable and coherent world food policy which would begin the task of alleviating widespread hunger and suffering prevalent in famine-stricken nations. The President shall report to the Congress within 120 days of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 1974] on the implementation of the resolutions and the extent to which the United States is participating in the implementation of resolutions adopted at the World Food Conference.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that shelter, including essential urban development services, is among the most fundamental of human needs. Shelter for most people in the developing countries consists largely of domestic materials assembled by local labor. While recognizing that most financing for such shelter must come from domestic resources, the Congress finds that carefully designed programs involving United States capital and expertise can increase the availability of domestic financing for improved shelter and related services for low-income people by demonstrating to local entrepreneurs and institutions that providing low-cost shelter can be financially viable. The Congress reaffirms, therefore, that the United States should continue to assist developing countries in marshalling resources for low-cost shelter. Particular attention should be given to programs which will support pilot projects for low-cost shelter or which will have a maximum demonstration impact on local institutions and national policy. The Congress declares that the long run goal of all such programs should be to develop domestic construction capabilities and to stimulate local credit institutions to make available domestic capital and other management and technological resources required for effective low-cost shelter programs and policies.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2186. Loan guarantees to Israel program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, during the period beginning October 1, 1992, and ending September 30, 1997, the President is authorized to issue guarantees against losses incurred in connection with loans to Israel made as a result of Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries. In the event that less than the full amount authorized to be issued under subsection (b) of this section is issued in such period, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall be available in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fiscal year levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to issue guarantees in furtherance of the purposes of this section. Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the total principal amount of guarantees which <!-- PDFPage:479 -->may be issued by the President under this section shall be up to $10,000,000,000 which may be issued as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in fiscal year 1993, up to $2,000,000,000 may be issued on October 1, 1992 or thereafter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subject to subsection (d) of this section, in fiscal years 1994 through 1997, up to $2,000,000,000 in each fiscal year may be issued on October 1 or thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If less than the full amount of guarantees authorized to be made available in a fiscal year pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection is issued to Israel during that fiscal year, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall extend to any subsequent fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Not later than September 1 of each year during the period in which the President is authorized to issue loan guarantees under subsection (a) of this section, beginning in fiscal year 1993, the President shall notify the appropriate congressional committees in writing of his intentions regarding the exercise of that authority for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of that year, including a statement of the total principal amount of guarantees, if any, that the President proposes to issue for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;appropriate congressional committees&rdquo; means the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Guarantees may be issued under this section only to support activities in the geographic areas which were subject to the administration of the Government of Israel before June 5, 1967.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on guarantee amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of authorized but unissued guarantees that the President is authorized to issue as specified in subsection (b) of this section shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount extended or estimated to have been extended by the Government of Israel during the previous year for activities which the President determines are inconsistent with the objectives of this section or understandings reached between the United States Government and the Government of Israel regarding the implementation of the loan program. The President shall submit a report to Congress no later than September 30 of each fiscal year during the pendency of the program specifying the amount calculated under this subsection and that will be deducted from the amount of guarantees authorized to be issued in the next fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Fees charged for the loan guarantee program under this section each year shall be an aggregate annual origination fee equal to the estimated subsidy cost of the guarantees issued under this section for that year, calculated by the Office of Management and Budget for the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]. This shall also include an amount for the administrative expenses of the Agency for International Development in administering the program under this section. All such fees shall be paid by the Government of Israel to the Government of the United States. Funds made available for Israel under part 4 of subchapter II of this chapter, may be utilized by the Government of Israel to pay such fees to the United States Government. No further appropriations of subsidy cost are needed for the loan guarantee authorized hereunder for fiscal year 1993 and the four succeeding fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The origination fee shall be payable to the United States Government on a pro rata basis as each guarantee for each loan or increment is issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authority to suspend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (<em>l</em>) and (m) of this section, the President shall determine the terms and conditions for issuing guarantees. If the President determines that these terms and conditions have been breached, the President may suspend or terminate the provision of all or part of the additional loan guarantees not yet issued under this section. Upon making such a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Procedures for suspension or termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any suspension or termination pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon making a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such a suspension or termination shall cease to be effective if Congress enacts, within 30 days of submission, a joint resolution authorizing the assistance notwithstanding the suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any such joint resolution shall be considered in the Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions under this subsection, a motion to proceed to the consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In the event that the President suspends the provision of additional loan guarantees under subsection (f) of this section and Congress does not enact a joint resolution pursuant to this subsection, the provision of additional loan guarantees under the program established by this section may be resumed only if the President determines and so reports to Congress that the reasons for the suspension have been resolved or that the resumption is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:480 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Economic context</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The effective absorption of immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia within the private sector requires large investment and economic restructuring to promote market efficiency and thereby contribute to productive employment and sustainable growth. Congress recognizes that the Government of Israel is developing an economic strategy designed to achieve these goals, and that the Government of Israel intends to adopt a comprehensive, multi-year economic strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Congress also recognizes that these policies are being designed to reduce direct involvement of the government in the economic system and to promote private enterprise, important prerequisites for economic stability and sustainable growth.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that, as agreed between the two Governments and in order to further the policies specified in subsection (h) of this section, Israel and the United States should continue to engage in consultations concerning economic and financial measures, including structural and other reforms, that Israel should undertake during the pendency of this program to enable its economy to absorb and resettle immigrants and to accommodate the increased debt burden that will result from loans guaranteed pursuant to this section. It is the sense of the Congress that these consultations on economic measures should address progress and plans in the areas of budget policies, privatization, trade liberalization, financial and capital markets, labor markets, competition policy, and deregulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Goods and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the pendency of the loan program authorized under this section, it is anticipated that, in the context of the economic reforms undertaken pursuant to subsections (h) and (i) of this section, Israel's increased population due to its absorption of immigrants, and the liberalization by the Government of Israel of its trade policy with the United States, the amount of United States investment goods and services purchased for use in or with respect to the country of Israel will substantially increase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall report to Congress by December 31 of each fiscal year until December 31, 1999, regarding the implementation of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Applicability of certain sections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 2183 of this title shall apply to guarantees issued under subsection (a) of this section in the same manner as such section applies to guarantees issued under section 2182 of this title, except that subsections (a), (e)(1), (g), and (j) of section 2183 of this title shall not apply to such guarantees and except that, to the extent section 2183 of this title is inconsistent with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], that Act shall apply. Loans shall be guaranteed under this section without regard to sections 2181, 2182, and 2198(c) of this title. Notwithstanding section 2183(f) of this title, the interest rate for loans guaranteed under this section may include a reasonable fee to cover the costs and fees incurred by the borrower in connection with this program or financing under this section in the event the borrower elects not to finance such costs or fees out of loan principal.

<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation, in determining whether to provide insurance, financing, or reinsurance for a project, shall especially&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be guided by the economic and social development impact and benefits of such a project and the ways in which such a project complements, or is compatible with, other development assistance programs or projects of the United States or other donors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) give preferential consideration to investment projects in less developed countries that have per capita incomes of $984 or less in 1986 United States dollars, and restrict its activities with respect to investment projects in less developed countries that have per capita incomes of $4,269 or more in 1986 United States dollars (other than countries designated as beneficiary countries under section 2702 of title 19, Ireland, and Northern Ireland); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that the project is consistent with the provisions of section 2151p of this title, section 2151p&ndash;1 of this title, and section 2151q of this title relating to the environment and natural resources of, and tropical forests and endangered species in, developing countries, and consistent with the intent of regulations issued pursuant to section 2151p of this title, section 2151p&ndash;1 of this title, and section 2151q of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out its purpose, the Corporation, utilizing broad criteria, shall undertake&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) to conduct financing, insurance, and reinsurance operations on a self-sustaining basis, taking into account in its financing operations the economic and financial soundness of projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) to utilize private credit and investment institutions and the Corporation's guaranty authority as the principal means of mobilizing capital investment funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) to broaden private participation and revolve its funds through selling its direct investments to private investors whenever it can appropriately do so on satisfactory terms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) to conduct its insurance operations with due regard to principles of risk management including efforts to share its insurance and reinsurance risks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) to the maximum degree possible consistent with its purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(1) to give preferential consideration in its investment insurance, reinsurance, and guaranty activities to investment projects sponsored by or involving United States small business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) to increase the proportion of projects sponsored by or significantly involving United States small business to at least 30 percent of all projects insured, reinsured, or guaranteed by the Corporation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) to consider in the conduct of its operations the extent to which less developed country governments are receptive to private enterprise, domestic and foreign, and their willingness and ability to maintain conditions which enable private enterprise to make its full contribution to the development process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(g) to foster private initiative and competition and discourage monopolistic practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(h) to further to the greatest degree possible, in a manner consistent with its goals, the balance-of-payments and employment objectives of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to conduct its activities in consonance with the activities of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter and the international trade, investment, and financial policies of the United States Government, and to seek to support those developmental projects having positive trade benefits for the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(k)(1) to decline to issue any contract of insurance or reinsurance, or any guaranty, or to enter into any agreement to provide financing for an eligible investor's proposed investment if the Corporation determines that such investment is likely to cause such investor (or the sponsor of an investment project in which such investor is involved) significantly to reduce the number of his employees in the United States production he is replacing his United States production with production from such investment which involves substantially the same product for substantially the same market as his United States production; and (2) to monitor conformance with the representations of the investor on which the Corporation relied in making the determination required by clause (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(<em>l</em>) to decline to issue any contract of insurance or reinsurance, or any guaranty, or to enter into any agreement to provide financing for an eligible investor's proposed investment if the Corporation determines that such investment is likely to cause a significant reduction in the number of employees in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(m) to refuse to insure, reinsure, or finance any investment subject to performance requirements which would reduce substantially the positive trade benefits likely to accrue to the United States from the investment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(n) to refuse to insure, reinsure, guarantee, or finance any investment in connection with <!-- PDFPage:482 -->a project which the Corporation determines will pose an unreasonable or major environmental, health, or safety hazard, or will result in the significant degradation of national parks or similar protected areas.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) To issue insurance, upon such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine, to eligible investors assuring protection in whole or in part against any or all of the following risks with respect to projects which the Corporation has approved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) inability to convert into United States dollars other currencies, or credits in such currencies, received as earnings or profits from the approved project, as repayment or return of the investment therein, in whole or in part, or as compensation for the sale or disposition of all or any part thereof;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Recognizing that major private investments in less developed friendly countries or areas are often made by enterprises in which there is multinational participation, including significant United States private participation, the Corporation may make arrangements with foreign governments (including agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions thereof) or with multilateral organizations and institutions for sharing liabilities assumed under investment insurance for such investments and may in connection therewith issue insurance to investors not otherwise eligible hereunder, except that liabilities assumed by the Corporation under the authority of this subsection shall be consistent with the purposes of this subpart and that the maximum share of liabilities so assumed shall not exceed the proportionate participation by eligible investors in the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not more than 10 per centum of the maximum contingent liability of investment insurance which the Corporation is permitted to have outstanding under section 2195(a)(1) of this title shall be issued to a single investor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before issuing insurance for the first time for loss due to business interruption, and in each subsequent instance in which a significant expansion is proposed in the type of risk to be insured under the definition of &ldquo;civil strife&rdquo; or &ldquo;business interruption&rdquo;, the Corporation shall, at least sixty days before such insurance is issued, submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on For<!-- PDFPage:486 -->eign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report with respect to such insurance, including a thorough analysis of the risks to be covered, anticipated losses, and proposed rates and reserves and, in the case of insurance for loss due to business interruption, an explanation of the underwriting basis upon which the insurance is to be offered. Any such report with respect to insurance for loss due to business interruption shall be considered in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications pursuant to section 2394&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investment guaranties</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">To make loans in United States dollars repayable in dollars or loans in foreign currencies (including, without regard to section 1306 of title 31, such foreign currencies which the Secretary of the Treasury may determine to be excess to the normal requirements of the United States and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may allocate) to firms privately owned or of mixed private and public ownership upon such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine. Loans may be made under this subsection only for projects that are sponsored by or significantly involve United States small business or cooperatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation may designate up to 25 percent of any loan under this subsection for use in the development or adaptation in the United States of new technologies or new products or services that are to be used in the project for which the loan is made and are likely to contribute to the economic or social development of less developed countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">No loan may be made under this subsection to finance any operation for the extraction of oil or gas. The aggregate amount of loans under this subsection to finance operations for the mining or other extraction of any deposit of ore or other nonfuel minerals may not in any fiscal year exceed $4,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investment encouragement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Corporation shall not finance any survey to ascertain the existence, location, extent, or quality of, or to determine the feasibility of undertaking operations for the extraction of, oil or gas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) expenditures financed by the Corporation during any fiscal year on surveys to ascertain the existence, location, extent, or quality of, or to determine the feasibility of undertaking operations for the extraction of nonfuel minerals may not exceed $200,000.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional insurance functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To make and carry out contracts of insurance or reinsurance, or agreements to associate or share risks, with insurance companies, financial institutions, any other persons, or groups thereof, and employing the same, where appropriate, as its agent, or acting as their agent, in the issuance and servicing of insurance, the adjustment of claims, the exercise of subrogation rights, the ceding and accepting of reinsurance, and in any other matter incident to an insurance business; except that such agreements and contracts shall be consistent with the purposes of the Corporation set forth in section 2191 of this title and shall be on equitable terms.</p>

However, no appropriations shall be made to augment the Insurance Reserve until the amount of funds in the Insurance Reserve is less than $25,000,000.

In order to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance, the Corporation is authorized to issue from time to time for purchase by the Secretary of the Treasury its notes, debentures, bonds, or other obligations; but the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000. Any such obligation shall be repaid to the Treasury within one year after the date of issue of such obligation. Any such obligation shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of any obligation authorized by this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligation of the Corporation issued under this subsection, and for such purchase he may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 after August 27, 1974. The purpose for which securities may be issued under such chapter shall include any such purchase.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional objectives and findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the United States should strengthen the capacities of the United States land-grant and other eligible universities in program-related agricultural institutional development and research, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a&ndash;1 of this title, should improve their participation in the United States Government's international efforts to apply more effective agricultural sciences to the goal of increasing world food production, and in general should provide increased and longer term support to the application of science to solving food and nutrition problems of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress so declares because it finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress in this country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with foreign agricultural institutions in expanding indigenous food production for both domestic and international markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that, in a world of growing population with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger but to build the economic base for growth, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current yields are lowest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional development therefor are prime factors in increasing agricultural production abroad (as well as in the United States) and in improving food distribution, storage, and marketing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture in the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that universities need a dependable source of Federal funding, as well as other financing, in order to expand, or in some cases to continue, their efforts to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional objectives and declaration for collation of components to increase world food production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, various components must be brought together in order to increase world food production, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) strengthening the capabilities of universities to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) institution-building programs for development of national and regional agricultural research and extension capacities in developing countries which need assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) international agricultural research centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contract research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) research program grants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) University involvement, participation, and cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each component;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide mechanisms for the universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assist such universities in cooperative joint efforts with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) agricultural institutions in developing nations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) regional and international agricultural research centers,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">directed to strengthening their joint and respective capabilities and to engage them more effectively in research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, distribution, storage, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally underdeveloped nations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Universities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this subpart, the term &ldquo;universities&rdquo; means those colleges or universities in each State, territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, now receiving, or which may hereafter receive, benefits under the Act of July 2, 1862 (known as the First Morrill Act) [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], or the Act of August 30, 1890 (known as the Second Morrill Act) [7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.], which are commonly known as &ldquo;land-grant&rdquo; universities; institutions now designated or which may hereafter be designated as sea-grant colleges under the Act of October 15, 1966 (known as the National Sea Grant College and Program Act) [33 U.S.C. 1121 et seq.], which are commonly known as sea-grant colleges; and other United States colleges and universities which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) have demonstrable capacity in teaching, research, and extension activities in the agricultural sciences; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) can contribute effectively to the attainment of the objectives of this subpart.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) half a billion people suffer regularly from malnutrition or undernutrition;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) even very modest shortfalls in crop production can result in greatly increased human suffering, and undercut the benefits of bilateral and multilateral assistance programs, in poor developing countries with chronic food deficits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) increasing variability in world food production and trade presents a serious threat not only to consumers but also to producers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the World Food Conference recognized the urgent need for an international undertaking to achieve a system of world food security based largely upon strategic food reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Congress through legislation has repeatedly urged the President to negotiate with other nations to establish such a system of reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) although the nations of the world have agreed to begin discussions on a system of grain reserves to regulate food availability, agreement on a global network of nationally held reserves still eludes the international community;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) while some progress has taken place in the United States in creating domestic farmer held reserves, the scale of such reserves does not insure adequate protection against fluctuations in world production and price; and</p>
