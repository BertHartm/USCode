<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Delegation by President; rules and regulations; utilization of goods and services from private enterprise, and facilities and resources of Federal agencies when not competitive with private enterprise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may exercise any functions conferred upon him by this chapter through such agency or officer of the United States Government as he shall direct. The head of any such agency or such officer may from time to time promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out such functions, and may delegate authority to perform any such functions, including, if he shall so specify, the authority successively to redelegate any of such functions to any of his subordinates. In providing technical assistance under this chapter, the head of any such agency or such officer shall utilize, to the fullest extent practicable, goods and professional and other services from private enterprise on a contract basis. In such fields as education, health, housing, or agriculture, the facilities and resources of other Federal agencies shall be utilized when such facilities are particularly or uniquely suitable for technical assistance, are not competitive with private enterprise, and can be made available without interfering unduly with domestic programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility of suppliers; debarment period; causes for debarment; conditions for reinstatement; periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall issue and enforce regulations determining the eligibility of any person to receive funds made available under this chapter. A person may be suspended under such regulations for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation and any resulting judicial or debarment proceedings, upon cause for belief that such person or an affiliate thereof probably has undertaken conduct which constitutes a cause for debarment; and, after an op<!-- PDFPage:629 -->portunity has been afforded to such person for a hearing, he may be debarred for an additional period, not to exceed three years. Among the causes for debarment shall be (1) offering or accepting a bribe or other illegal payment or credit in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (2) committing a fraud in the procurement or performance of any contract financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (3) acting in any other manner which shows a lack of integrity or honesty in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter. Reinstatement of eligibility in each particular case shall be subject to such conditions as the President shall direct. Each person whose eligibility is denied or suspended under this subsection shall, upon request, be entitled to a review of his eligibility not less often than once every two years.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1979, to consolidate certain foreign assistance activities of the United States Government. I am acting under the authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act, chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code, and pursuant to title III of the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1978 [Pub. L. 95&ndash;424, Oct. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 955, set out as a note under 22 U.S.C. 2151], which requires that I report to the Congress my decisions on reorganization in this area. The purposes of this reorganization are to make more coherent our economic policies and programs affecting the developing nations and to improve the effectiveness of United States foreign development activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">This Nation is committed&mdash;not only in the interest of the people of developing countries, but in our own interest as well&mdash;to help those countries in their efforts to achieve better lives for their citizens. To this end, we conduct a number of bilateral development assistance programs, participate in a number of multilateral development assistance programs, and engage in a variety of other economic activities that affect developing countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">When this Administration took office, United States support of international development suffered from four major problems. First, no single U.S. official was charged with responsibility for establishing a comprehensive and coherent strategy for our Nation's efforts in this field. Second, no agency or official had the authority to ensure that the various U.S. programs affecting development were consistent with each other or complemented the programs of the multilateral organizations to which we contribute. Third, none of the agency heads testifying before the Congress about his particular portion of our foreign assistance efforts was able to speak authoritatively for the program as a whole or for the Administration's overall development policies and priorities. Finally, because there was no authoritative spokesperson, developmental concerns were at times accorded insufficient weight in executive branch decision-making on trade, monetary, and other non-aid economic issues that affect developing nations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Just before his death a year ago, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey prepared a bill intended to solve these problems. Congressman Clement Zablocki introduced a similar measure in the House. Although the Congress took no action last year on the organizational provisions of the Humphrey-Zablocki bill, it directed me, in title III of the 1978 development assistance authorization act, to institute a strengthened system of coordination of U.S. economic policies affecting the developing countries, and urged me to create an agency with primary responsibility for coordination of international development-related activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">In response to the Humphrey-Zablocki bill and the Administration's own analyses, I took a number of steps last year to strengthen aid coordination and improve the effectiveness of our development assistance programs. The Reorganization Plan transmitted with this message continues that process. It will provide stronger direction of U.S. policies toward the developing world, ensure a more coherent development strategy, promote the more effective use of the various U.S. bilateral instruments by which the U.S. can encourage economic and social progress in developing countries, and ensure that U.S. bilateral programs and the multilateral programs to which we contribute better complement each other.</p>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization would create a new agency, to be known as the International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA). IDCA would become a focal point within the U.S. Government for economic matters affecting U.S. relations with developing countries. Subject to guidance concerning the foreign policy of the United States from the Secretary of State, the IDCA Director would be the principal international development advisor to the President and to the Secretary of State. The <!-- PDFPage:631 -->Director would replace the AID Administrator in chairing the Development Coordination Committee. The IDCA Director would make recommendations to me concerning the appointment and tenure of senior officials of each component of IDCA, and would establish and control the budgets and policies of the Agency for International Development and the bilateral foreign assistance programs it administers, and of the Institute For Technological Cooperation, proposed in legislation transmitted to the Congress on February 26, 1979, which would support research and technological innovation to reduce obstacles to economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which insures and guarantees U.S. private investments in developing countries against certain hazards, would also be a component of IDCA, but OPIC's Board of Directors, which the IDCA Director would chair, would continue to set OPIC policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each of these agencies would retain its individual identity and substantial day-to-day operating autonomy. A principal responsibility of the IDCA Director&mdash;who would be supported by a small staff&mdash;would be the achievement of consistency and balance among the policies, major programs, and budgets of the component agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">To help insure that U.S. bilateral efforts and the programs of major multilateral development institutions better complement each other, the IDCA Director would participate in the selection of U.S. Executive Directors of multilateral development banks (World Bank Group, Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank and African Development Fund), and would advise these Executive Directors on development policy and proposed projects and programs. Additionally, IDCA would assume lead responsibility for budget support and policy concerning United States participation in those organizations and programs of the United Nations and the Organization of American States whose purpose is primarily developmental. These are the UN Development Program, UNICEF, the Organization of American States Technical Assistance Funds, the UN Capital Development Fund, the UN Educational and Training Program for Southern Africa, the UN/Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) World Food Program, the FAO Post-Harvest Losses Fund, and the UN Disaster Relief Organization.</p>
<p class="note-body">The IDCA Director would be responsible for insuring that development goals are taken fully into account in all executive branch decision-making on trade, technology, and other economic policy issues affecting the less developed nations, and would submit an annual development policy statement to the Congress. The Director would also prepare a comprehensive foreign assistance budget, which he would submit to the Office of Management and Budget after consulting with the Secretary of State, and would lead the Administration's presentation of that budget to the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">When IDCA is established, I intend to delegate to it the principal authority for the bilateral development assistance program administered by AID (now vested in me by law, delegated to the Secretary of State, and redelegated to the Administrator of AID). Certain functions vested in me under the Foreign Assistance Act will continue to be delegated to the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, or elsewhere; but most functions relating to the assistance program will be delegated directly to the IDCA Director, who will in turn redelegate these functions, as appropriate, to the Administrator of AID. I also intend to delegate to the Director of IDCA authority proposed to be vested in me to establish an Institute For Technological Cooperation; the IDCA Director would redelegate these functions, as appropriate, to IFTC.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization would increase program effectiveness through improved coordination, as requested in the 1978 authorization act. I estimate that it would achieve that goal with no increase in expenditures or personnel. After investigation, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to carry out the policy set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. This plan abolishes one of the statutory officers that the President may appoint under section 624(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2384(a)). No statutory functions are abolished by the plan. The provisions in this plan for the appointment and pay of the Director, Deputy Director, and Associate Directors of IDCA have been found by me to be necessary by reason of the reorganization and are at rates applicable to comparable officers in the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">This proposal constitutes the first major restructuring of the U.S. foreign aid program since the creation of the Agency for International Development in 1961. It will provide the United States with governmental machinery far better able to fulfill our commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness and ignorance. It responds to the mandate of the Congress. Let us work together to insure its successful and effective implementation.</p>
