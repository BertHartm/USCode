<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2351. Encouragement of free enterprise and private participation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress of the United States recognizes the vital role of free enterprise in achieving rising levels of production and standards of living essential to economic progress and development. Accordingly, it is declared to be the policy of the United States to encourage the efforts of other countries to increase the flow of international trade, to foster private initiative and competition, to encourage the development and use of cooperatives, credit unions, and savings and loan associations, to discourage monopolistic practices, to improve the technical efficiency of their industry, agriculture, and commerce, and to strengthen free labor unions; and to encourage the contribution of United States enterprise toward economic strength of less developed friendly countries, through private trade and investment abroad, private participation in programs carried out under this chapter (including the use of private trade channels to the maximum extent practicable in carrying out such programs), and exchange of ideas and technical information on the matters covered by this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Action by President to facilitate participation to maximum extent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage and facilitate participation by private enterprise to the maximum extent practicable in achieving any of the purposes of this chapter, the President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make arrangements to find, and draw the attention of private enterprise to, opportunities for investment and development in less-developed friendly countries and areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish an effective system for obtaining adequate information with respect to the activities of, and opportunities for, nongovernmental participation in the development process, and for utilizing such information in the planning, direction, and execution of programs carried out under this chapter, and in the coordination of such programs with the ever-increasing developmental activities of nongovernmental United States institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) accelerate a program of negotiating treaties for commerce and trade, including tax treaties, which shall include provisions to encourage and facilitate the flow of private investment to, and its equitable treatment in, friendly countries and areas participating in programs under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) seek, consistent with the national interest, compliance by other countries or areas with all treaties for commerce and trade and taxes, and take all reasonable measures under this chapter or other authority to secure compliance therewith and to assist United States citizens in obtaining just compensation for losses sustained by them or payments exacted from them as a result of measures taken or imposed by any country or area thereof in violation of any such treaty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the maximum extent practicable carry out programs of assistance through private channels and to the extent practicable in conjunction with local private or governmental participation, including loans under the authority of section 2151t of this title to any individual, corporation, or other body of persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) take appropriate steps to discourage nationalization, expropriation, confiscation, seizure of ownership or control, of private investment and discriminatory or other actions having the effect thereof, undertaken by countries receiving assistance under this chapter, which divert available resources essential to create new wealth, employment, and productivity in those countries and otherwise impair the climate for new private investment essential to the stable economic growth and development of those countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) utilize wherever practicable the services of United States private enterprise (including, but not limited to, the services of experts and consultants in technical fields such as engineering); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) utilize wherever practicable the services of United States private enterprise on a cost-plus incentive fee contract basis to provide the necessary skills to develop and operate a specific project or program of assistance in a less developed friendly country or area in any case in which direct private investment is not readily encouraged, and provide where appropriate for the transfer of equity ownership in such project or program to private investors at the earliest feasible time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) International Private Investment Advisory Council on Foreign Aid; establishment; composition; selection of members by Administrator; duration of service; Chairman; duties of Council; compensation; travel and other expenses; funds for payment of expenses of Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is hereby established an International Private Investment Advisory Council on Foreign Aid to be composed of such number of leading American business specialists as may be selected, from time to time, by the Administrator of the Agency for International Development for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this subsection. The members of the Council shall serve at the pleasure of the Administrator, who shall designate one member to serve as Chairman.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It shall be the duty of the Council, at the request of the Administrator, to make recommendations to the Administrator with respect to particular aspects of programs and activities under this chapter where private enterprise can play a contributing role and to act as liaison for the Administrator to involve specific private enterprises in such programs and activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The members of the Advisory Council shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be entitled to reimbursement in accordance with section 5703 of title 5 for travel and other expenses incurred by them in the performance of their functions under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The expenses of the Advisory Council shall be paid by the Administrator from funds otherwise available under this chapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:696 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Engineering and professional services of United States firms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that the Agency for International Development should continue to encourage, to the maximum extent consistent with the national interest, the utilization of engineering and professional services of United States firms (including, but not limited to, any corporation, company, partnership, or other association) or by an affiliate of such United States firms in connection with capital projects financed by funds authorized under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contracts on basis of competitive selection procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that significantly greater effort must be made in carrying out programs under subchapter I of this chapter to award contracts on the basis of competitive selection procedures. All such contracts should be let on the basis of competitive selection procedures except in those limited cases in which the procurement regulations governing the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter allow noncompetitive procedures to be used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Repealed. Pub. L. 97&ndash;113, title VII, &sect;734(a)(1), Dec. 29, 1981, 95 Stat. 1560.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the President determines, on a case-by-case basis, that procurement in such other country is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) to meet unforeseen circumstances, such as emergency situations, where it is important to permit procurement in a country not specified in subparagraph (A); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) to promote efficiency in the use of United States foreign assistance resources, including to avoid impairment of foreign assistance objectives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agricultural commodities or products thereof available for disposition under Food for Peace Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing for the procurement of any agricultural commodity or product thereof available for disposition under the Food for Peace Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.], for transfer by grant under this chapter to any recipient country in accordance with its requirements, the President shall, insofar as practicable and when <!-- PDFPage:699 -->in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, authorize the procurement of such agricultural commodity only within the United States except to the extent that such agricultural commodity is not available in the United States in sufficient quantities to supply emergency requirements of recipients under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Advances or reimbursements which are received under this section within one hundred and eighty days after the close of the fiscal year in which such services and commodities are delivered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Advances or reimbursements received pursuant to agreements executed under this section in which reimbursement will not be completed within one hundred and eighty days after the close of the fiscal year in which such services and commodities are delivered: <em>Provided</em>, That such agreements require the payment of interest at the current rate established pursuant to section 635(b)(1)(B) of title 12, and repayment of such principal and interest does not exceed a period of three years from the date of signing of the agreement to provide the service: <em>Provided further</em>, That funds available for this paragraph in any fiscal year shall not exceed $1,000,000 of the total funds authorized for use in such fiscal year by part I of subchapter I of this chapter, and shall be available only to the extent provided in appropriation Acts. Interest shall accrue as of the date of disbursement to the agency or organization providing such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agency contracts with individuals to perform services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When any agency of the United States Government provides services on an advance-of-funds or reimbursable basis under this section, such agency may contract with individuals for personal service abroad or in the United States to perform such services or to replace officers or employees of the United States Government who are assigned by the agency to provide such services. Such individuals shall not be regarded as employees of the United States Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Excess property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, no Government-owned excess property shall be made available under this section, section 2358 of this title, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of subchapter I of this chapter, unless, before the shipment of such property for use in a specified country (or transfer, if the property is already in such country), the agency administering such subchapter I has approved such shipment (or transfer) and made a written determination&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:702 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that there is a need for such property in the quantity requested and that such property is suitable for the purpose requested;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as to the status and responsibility of the designated end-user and his ability effectively to use and maintain such property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that the residual value, serviceability, and appearance of such property would not reflect unfavorably on the image of the United States and would justify the costs of packing, crating, handling, transportation, and other accessorial costs, and that the residual value at least equals the total of these costs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of transferring property described in this subsection in furtherance of the provisions of part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter, the phrase &ldquo;the agency administering such subchapter I&rdquo; shall be considered to refer to the Department of State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State, acting through the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, is authorized to transfer to any friendly country, international organization, the American Red Cross, or other voluntary nonprofit relief agency described in subsection (a) of this section, Government-owned excess property made available under this section or section 2358 of this title in order to support activities carried out under subchapter I of this chapter which are designed to enhance environmental protection in foreign countries if the Secretary of State makes a written determination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that there is a need for such property in the quantity requested and that such property is suitable for the purpose requested;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as to the status and responsibility of the designated end-user and his ability effectively to use and maintain such property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that the residual value, serviceability, and appearance of such property would not reflect unfavorably on the image of the United States and would justify the costs of packing, crating, handling, transportation, and other accessorial costs, and that the residual value at least equals the total of these costs.</p>

This restriction may not be waived pursuant to any authority contained in this chapter unless the President finds and promptly reports to Congress that: (A) such assistance is vital to the security of the United States; (B) the recipient country is not controlled by the international Communist conspiracy; and (C) such assistance will further promote the independence of the recipient country from international communism.

It is the sense of the Congress that when consideration is given to authorizing assistance to a country removed from the application of this subsection, one of the factors to be weighed, among others, is whether the country in question is giving evidence of fostering the establishment of a genuinely democratic system, with respect for internationally recognized human rights.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no monetary assistance shall be made available under this chapter to any government or political subdivision or agency of such government which will be used to compensate owners for expropriated or nationalized property and, upon finding by the President that such assistance has been used by any government for such purpose, no further assistance under this chapter shall be furnished to such government until appropriate reimbursement is made to the United States for sums so diverted. This prohibition shall not apply to monetary assistance made available for use by a government (or a political subdivision or agency of a government) to compensate nationals of that country in accordance with a land reform program, if the President determines that monetary assistance for such land reform program will further the national interests of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration and statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the achievement of a just and lasting Cyprus settlement is and will remain a central objective of United States for<!-- PDFPage:728 -->eign policy. The Congress further declares that any action of the United States with respect to section 2370(x)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2373_1_target" name="2373_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall not signify a lessening of the United States commitment to a just solution to the conflict on Cyprus but is authorized in the expectation that this action will be conducive to achievement of a Cyprus solution and a general improvement in relations among Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus and between those countries and the United States. The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a just settlement on Cyprus must involve the establishment of a free and independent government on Cyprus and must guarantee that the human rights of all of the people of Cyprus are fully protected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a just settlement on Cyprus must include the withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the guidelines for inter-communal talks agreed to in Nicosia in February 1977 and the United Nations resolutions regarding Cyprus provide a sound basis for negotiation of a just settlement on Cyprus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) serious negotiations, under United Nations auspices, will be necessary to achieve agreement on, and implementation of, constitutional and territorial terms within such guidelines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the recent proposals by both Cypriot communities regarding the return of the refugees to the city of New Famagusta (Varosha) constitute a positive step and the United States should actively support the efforts of the Secretary General of the United Nations with respect to this issue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Governing principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">United States policy regarding Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey shall be directed toward the restoration of a stable and peaceful atmosphere in the Eastern Mediterranean region and shall therefore be governed by the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States shall actively support the resolution of differences through negotiations and internationally established peaceful procedures, shall encourage all parties to avoid provocative actions, and shall strongly oppose any attempt to resolve disputes through force or threat of force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The United States will accord full support and high priority to efforts, particularly those of the United Nations, to bring about a prompt, peaceful settlement on Cyprus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) All defense articles furnished by the United States to countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region will be used only in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.], and the agreements under which those defense articles were furnished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States will furnish security assistance for Greece and Turkey only when furnishing that assistance is intended solely for defensive purposes, including when necessary to enable the recipient country to fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and shall be designed to ensure that the present balance of military strength among countries of the region, including between Greece and Turkey, is preserved. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of defense articles to Greece or Turkey for legitimate self defense or to enable Greece or Turkey to fulfill their North Atlantic Treaty Organization obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The United States shall use its influence to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire on Cyprus until an equitable negotiated settlement is reached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The United States shall use its influence to achieve the withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus in the context of a solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of policy; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Because progress toward a Cyprus settlement is a high priority of United States policy in the Eastern Mediterranean, the President and the Congress shall continually review that progress and shall determine United States policy in the region accordingly. To facilitate such a review the President shall, within 60 days after the date of enactment of this section and at the end of each succeeding 60-day period, transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on progress made toward the conclusion of a negotiated solution of the Cyprus problem. Such transmissions shall include any relevant reports prepared by the Secretary General of the United Nations for the Security Council.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certification by President to Congress of assistance to Greece and Turkey</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to ensure that United States assistance is furnished consistent with the policies established in this section, the President shall, whenever requesting any funds for security assistance under this chapter or the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] for Greece and Turkey, transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate his certification, with a full explanation thereof, that the furnishing of such assistance will be consistent with the principles set forth in subsection (b). The President shall also submit such a certification with any notification to the Congress, pursuant to section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2776(b)], of a proposed sale of defense articles or services to Greece or Turkey.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Arms sales agreements to prohibit transfer to Cyprus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any agreement for the sale or provision of any article on the United States Munitions List (established pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2778]) entered into by the United States after December 22, 1987, shall expressly state that the article is being provided by the United States only with the understanding that it will not be transferred to Cyprus or otherwise used to further the severance or division of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall report to Congress any substantial evidence that equipment provided <!-- PDFPage:729 -->under any such agreement has been used in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional policy, findings, and goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan pose a security threat to Pakistan. The Congress also recognizes that an independent and democratic Pakistan with continued friendly ties with the United States is in the interest of both nations. The Congress finds that United States assistance will help Pakistan maintain its independence. Assistance to Pakistan is intended to benefit the people of Pakistan by helping them meet the burdens imposed by the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan and by promoting economic development. In authorizing assistance to Pakistan, it is the intent of Congress to promote the expeditious restoration of full civil liberties and representative government in Pakistan. The Congress further recognizes that it is in the mutual interest of Pakistan and the United States to avoid the profoundly destabilizing effects of the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices or the capacity to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear devices.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:730 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reaffirmation of 1959 bilateral agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States reaffirms the commitment made in its 1959 bilateral agreement with Pakistan relating to aggression from a Communist or Communist-dominated state.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in this subsection, military equipment, technology, or defense services, other than F&ndash;16 aircraft, may be transferred to Pakistan pursuant to contracts or cases entered into before October 1, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Storage costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may release the Government of Pakistan of its contractual obligation to pay the United States Government for the storage costs of items purchased prior to October 1, 1990, but not delivered by the United States Government pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and may reimburse the Government of Pakistan for any such amount paid, on such terms and conditions as the President may prescribe: <em>Provided</em>, That such payments have no budgetary impact.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Congressional Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Pakistan that is a full and reliable partner in the struggle against the Taliban, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups, and is a responsible steward of its nuclear weapons and technology, is vital to the national security of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Since September 11, 2001, the Government of Pakistan has been a critical ally and an important partner in removing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and combating al Qaeda.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Pakistan has made great sacrifices in the shared struggle against al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups, engaging in military operations that have led to the deaths of hundreds of Pakistani security personnel and enduring acts of terrorism that have killed hundreds of Pakistani civilians.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2376. Nuclear non-proliferation policy in South Asia</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and stability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) South Asia, in particular, is an area where the threat of a regional nuclear exchange remains high due to continued Indo-Pakistani tensions over issues such as Kashmir;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to date, United States efforts to halt proliferation in South Asia have failed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) although global disarmament is a desirable goal which should be vigorously pursued, both regional and sub-regional security arrangements can serve to decrease tensions and promote non-proliferation in certain areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) thus far, there has been some success on a regional basis, such as the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone and the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in particular, in Latin America, the Treaty of Tlatelolco has been signed by all the nuclear powers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a critical part of this treaty is Protocol II which prohibits nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on signatories to the treaty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in 1991, a proposal was made for a regional conference on non-proliferation in South Asia which would include Pakistan, India, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) thus far, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States have expressed interest in attending such a conference, whereas India has refused to attend.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should pursue a policy which seeks a regional negotiated solution to the issue of nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia at the earliest possible time, including a protocol to be signed by all nuclear weapons states, prohibiting nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on countries in the region. Such a policy should have as its ultimate goal concurrent accession by Pakistan and India to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and should also include as needed a phased approach to that goal through a series of agreements among the parties on nuclear issues, such as the agreement reached by Pakistan and India not to attack one another's nuclear facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report on progress toward regional non-proliferation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than April 1 of each year, the President shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, on nuclear proliferation in South Asia, including efforts taken by the United States to achieve a regional agreement on nuclear non-proliferation, and including a comprehensive list of the obstacles to concluding such a regional agreement.</p>

Among the causes for debarment shall be (1) offering or accepting a bribe or other illegal payment or credit in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (2) committing a fraud in the procurement or performance of any contract financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (3) acting in any other manner which shows a lack of integrity or honesty in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;HELP Commission Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that, despite the long-standing efforts and resources of the United States dedicated to helping needy people around the world, despair remains and in many areas is growing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Therefore, a commission should be established to bring together the best minds associated with development and humanitarian assistance to make a comprehensive review of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) policy decisions, including why certain development projects are funded and others are not, successes, and best practices, including their applicability to other existing programs and projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) delivery obstacles, including the roles of United States agencies and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) methodology, including whether the delivery of United States development assistance always represents best practices and whether it can be improved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) results, including measuring improvements in human capacity instead of in purely economic terms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An examination of these issues should present new approaches and ideas to ensure that United States development assistance reaches and benefits its intended recipients.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of Commission; responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is established the Helping to Enhance the Livelihood of People (HELP) Around the Globe Commission (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify the past and present objectives of United States development assistance, identify cases in which those objectives have been met, identify the beneficiaries of such assistance, and what percentage of the funds provided actually reached the intended beneficiaries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify cases in which United States development assistance has been most successful, and analyze how such successes may be transferable to other countries or areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) study ways to expand educational opportunities and investments in people, and assess infrastructure needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) analyze how the United States could place conditions on governments in countries receiving United States development assistance, in light of and notwithstanding the objectives of the Millennium Challenge Account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) analyze ways in which the United States can coordinate its development assistance programs with those of other donor countries and international organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) analyze ways in which the safety of development assistance workers can be ensured, particularly in the midst of conflicts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) compare the effectiveness of increased and open trade with development assistance, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such trade and whether such trade could be a more effective alternative to United States development assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) analyze ways in which the United States can strengthen the capacity of indigenous nongovernmental organizations to be more effective in grassroots development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) analyze ways in which decisions on providing development assistance can involve more of the people of the recipient countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) analyze ways in which results can be measured if United States development assistance is targeted to the least developed countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) recommend standards that should be set for &ldquo;graduating&rdquo; recipient countries from United States development assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(L) analyze whether United States development assistance should be used as a means to achieve United States foreign policy objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(M) analyze how the United States can evaluate the performance of its development assistance programs not only against economic indicators, but in other ways, including how to measure the success of United States development assistance in democratization efforts; and evaluate the existing foreign assistance framework to ascertain the degree of coordination, or lack thereof, of the disparate foreign development programs as administered by the various Federal agencies, to identify and assess the redundancies of programs and organizational structures engaged in foreign assistance, and to recommend revisions to authorizing legislation for foreign assistance that would seek to reconcile competing foreign policy and foreign aid goals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(N) study any other areas that the Commission considers necessary relating to United States development assistance.</p>
