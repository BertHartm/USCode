<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage the banks to assist such countries in reducing and restructuring private debt through the use of a portion of a project or policy based environmental loan in ways which will enable such countries to buy back private debt at a rate of discount available for such debt, at auction in the secondary market or through negotiations with creditors holding such debt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) seek to ensure that staff of each bank facilitate debtor countries&rsquo; collaboration with local and international non-governmental or private organizations in implementing debt-for-nature exchanges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) seek to ensure that each bank adopts policy guidelines which to the maximum extent possible provide for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The United States Executive Directors of the multilateral development banks shall seek to negotiate with the other executive directors to provide guidelines for restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies. Pending the outcome of such negotiations, the United States Executive Directors shall consider restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies to be those which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) support development that maintains and restores the renewable natural resource base so that present and future needs of debtor countries&rsquo; populations can be met, while not impairing critical ecosystems and not exacerbating global environmental problems;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) promote the maintenance and restoration of soils, vegetation, hydrological cycles, wildlife, critical ecosystems (tropical forests, wetlands, and coastal marine resources), biological diversity and other natural resources essential to economic growth and human well-being and shall, when using natural resources, be implemented to minimize the depletion of such natural resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) take steps, wherever feasible, to prevent pollution that threatens human health and important biotic systems and to achieve patterns of energy consumption that meet human needs and rely on renewable resources.</p>
