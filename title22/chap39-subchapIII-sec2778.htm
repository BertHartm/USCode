The items so designated shall constitute the United States Munitions List.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Decisions on issuing export licenses under this section shall be made in coordination with the Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, taking into account the Director's assessment as to whether the export of an article would contribute to an arms <!-- PDFPage:855 -->race, aid in the development of weapons of mass destruction, support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral arms control or nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements. The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency is authorized, whenever the Director determines that the issuance of an export license under this section would be detrimental to the national security of the United States, to recommend to the President that such export license be disapproved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In exercising the authorities conferred by this section, the President may require that any defense article or defense service be sold under this chapter as a condition of its eligibility for export, and may require that persons engaged in the negotiation for the export of defense articles and services keep the President fully and currently informed of the progress and future prospects of such negotiations.</p>

Such regulations shall prohibit the return to the United States for sale in the United States (other than for the Armed Forces of the United States and its allies or for any State or local law enforcement agency) of any military firearms or ammunition of United States manufacture furnished to foreign governments by the United States under this chapter or any other foreign assistance or sales program of the United States, whether or not enhanced in value or improved in condition in a foreign country. This prohibition shall not extend to similar firearms that have been so substantially transformed as to become, in effect, articles of foreign manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) As prescribed in regulations issued under this section, every person (other than an officer or employee of the United States Government acting in official capacity) who engages in the business of brokering activities with respect to the manufacture, export, import, or transfer of any defense article or defense service designated by the President under subsection (a)(1) of this section, or in the business of brokering activities with respect to the manufacture, export, import, or transfer of any foreign defense article or defense service (as defined in subclause (IV)), shall register with the United States Government agency charged with the administration of this section, and shall pay a registration fee which shall be prescribed by such regulations.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Anti-personnel landmines, which are specifically designed to maim and kill people, have been used indiscriminately in dramatically increasing numbers, primarily in insurgencies in poor developing countries. Noncombatant civilians, including tens of thousands of children, have been the primary victims.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Unlike other military weapons, landmines often remain implanted and undiscovered after conflict has ended, causing untold suffering to civilian populations. In Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Angola, tens of millions of unexploded landmines have rendered whole areas uninhabitable. In Afghanistan, an estimated hundreds of thousands of people have been maimed and killed by landmines during the 14-year civil war. In Cambodia, more than 20,000 civilians have lost limbs and another 60 are being maimed each month from landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Over 35 countries are known to manufacture landmines, including the United States. However, the United States is not a major exporter of landmines. During the past ten years the Department of State has approved ten licenses for the commercial export of anti-personnel landmines valued at $980,000, and during the past five years the Department of Defense has approved the sale of 13,156 anti-personnel landmines valued at $841,145.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States signed, but has not ratified, the 1981 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects. The Convention prohibits the indiscriminate use of landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) When it signed the Convention, the United States stated: &lsquo;We believe that the Convention represents a positive step forward in efforts to minimize injury or damage to the civilian population in time of armed conflict. Our signature of the Convention reflects the general willingness of the United States to adopt practical and reasonable provisions concerning the conduct of military operations, for the purpose of protecting noncombatants.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The President should submit the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification, and the President should actively negotiate under United Nations auspices or other auspices an international agreement, or a modification of the Convention, to prohibit the sale, transfer or export of anti-personnel landmines. Such an agreement or modification would be an appropriate response to the end of the Cold War and the promotion of arms control agreements to reduce the indiscriminate killing and maiming of civilians.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The United States should set an example for other countries in such negotiations, by implementing a one-year moratorium on the sale, transfer or export of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It shall be the policy of the United States to seek verifiable international agreements prohibiting the sale, transfer, or export, and further limiting the use, production, possession, and deployment of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) It is the sense of the Congress that the President should actively seek to negotiate under United Nations auspices or other auspices an international agreement, or a modification of the Convention, to prohibit the sale, transfer, or export of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Moratorium on Transfers of Anti-Personnel Landmines Abroad</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During the eight-year period beginning on October 23, 1992&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) no sale may be made or financed, no transfer may be made, and no license for export may be issued, under the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.], with respect to any anti-personnel landmine; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) no assistance may be provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], with respect to the provision of any anti-personnel landmine.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, the term &lsquo;anti-personnel landmine&rsquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) any munition placed under, on, or near the ground or other surface area, or delivered by artillery, rocket, mortar, or similar means or dropped from an aircraft and which is designed to be detonated or exploded by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) any device or material which is designed, constructed, or adapted to kill or injure and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) any manually-emplaced munition or device designed to kill, injure, or damage and which is actuated by remote control or automatically after a lapse of time.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 401. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) nations in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, which accounted for over 40 percent of the international trade in weapons and related equipment and services during the decade of the 1980's, are the principal market for the worldwide arms trade;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) regional instability, large financial resources, and the desire of arms-supplying governments to gain influence in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, contribute to a regional arms race;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the continued proliferation of weapons and related equipment and services contribute further to a regional arms race in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region that is politically, economically, and militarily destabilizing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the continued proliferation of unconventional weapons, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, as well as delivery systems associated with those weapons, poses an urgent threat to security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the continued proliferation of ballistic missile technologies and ballistic missile systems that are <!-- PDFPage:860 -->capable of delivering conventional, nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads undermines security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) future security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region would be enhanced by establishing a stable military balance among regional powers by restraining and reducing both conventional and unconventional weapons;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) security, stability, peace, and prosperity in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region are important to the welfare of the international economy and to the national security interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) future security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region would be enhanced through the development of a multilateral arms transfer and control regime similar to those of the Nuclear Suppliers&rsquo; Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Australia Chemical Weapons Suppliers Group;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) such a regime should be developed, implemented, and agreed to through multilateral negotiations, including under the auspices of the 5 permanent members of the United Nations Security Council;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) confidence-building arms control measures such as the establishment of a centralized arms trade registry at the United Nations, greater multinational transparency on the transfer of defense articles and services prior to agreement or transfer, cooperative verification measures, advanced notification of military exercises, information exchanges, on-site inspections, and creation of a Middle East and Persian Gulf Conflict Prevention Center, are important to implement an effective multilateral arms transfer and control regime;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) as an interim step, the United States should consider introducing, during the ongoing negotiations on confidence security-building measures at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) [now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe], a proposal regarding the international exchange of information, on an annual basis, on the sale and transfer of major military equipment, particularly to the Middle East and Persian Gulf region; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) such a regime should be applied to other regions with the ultimate objective of achieving an effective global arms transfer and control regime, implemented and enforced through the United Nations Security Council, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) includes a linkage of humanitarian and developmental objectives with security objectives in Third World countries, particularly the poorest of the poor countries; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) encourages countries selling military equipment and services to consider the following factors before making conventional arms sales: the security needs of the purchasing countries, the level of defense expenditures by the purchasing countries, and the level of indigenous production of the purchasing countries.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Continuing negotiations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall continue negotiations among the 5 permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and commit the United States to a multilateral arms transfer and control regime for the Middle East and Persian Gulf region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Proposing a temporary moratorium during negotiations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the context of these negotiations, the President should propose to the 5 permanent members of the United Nations Security Council a temporary moratorium on the sale and transfer of major military equipment to nations in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region until such time as the 5 permanent members agree to a multilateral arms transfer and control regime.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose of the Regime</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of the multilateral arms transfer and control regime should be&mdash;</p>
