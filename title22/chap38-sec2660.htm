<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;210 derived from acts Mar. 9, 1868, ch. 22, &sect;1, 15 Stat. 40; June 8, 1872, ch. 335, &sect;20, 17 Stat. 287.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section was formerly classified to section 165 of Title 5 prior to the general revision and enactment of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, by Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;1, Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 378.</p>
<!-- field-end:codification-note -->
<!-- field-start:repeal-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Repeals</h4>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;210 and act June 20, 1874, cited as credits to this section, were also cited as credits for section 191a of former Title 44 (enacted as section 710 of Title 44 by Pub. L. 90&ndash;620, which enacted Title 44), and were repealed by section 3 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;620. Section 2(a) of Pub. L. 90&ndash;620 provided that the legislative purpose in enacting Title 44 was to restate without substantive change the laws replaced by revised Title 44. Because revised section 710 of Title 44 did not restate those provisions of R.S. &sect;210 and act June 20, 1874 which appear in this section, this section is not listed as having been repealed by section 3 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;620.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Transfer of Functions</h4>
<p class="note-body">Functions under the former provisions of this section which required the Secretary of State to furnish to the Public Printer a correct copy of every act and joint resolution, as soon as possible after its approval by the President, or after it has become a law in accordance with the Constitution without such approval, were transferred to the Administrator of General Services by Reorg. Plan No. 20 of 1950, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. Those provisions, as so amended, are set out as section 710 of Title 44, Public Printing and Documents. The Reorg. Plan excepted, from the transfer, those functions of the Secretary of State under this section with respect to treaties and other international agreements.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;United States Postal Service&rdquo; substituted in text for &ldquo;Postmaster General&rdquo; pursuant to section 4(a) of Pub. L. 91&ndash;375, set out as a note under section 201 of Title 39, Postal Service, which abolished office of Postmaster General of Post Office Department and transferred its functions to United States Postal Service.</p>
