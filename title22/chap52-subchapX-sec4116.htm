<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time of filing of charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge with the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the General Counsel determines that the person filing any charge was prevented from filing the charge during the 6-month period referred to in paragraph (1) by reason of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any failure of the Department or labor organization against which the charge is made to perform a duty owed to the person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any concealment which prevented discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice during the 6-month period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">The Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) shall conduct a hearing on the complaint not earlier than 5 days after the date on which the complaint is served. In the discretion of the individual or individuals conducting the hearing, any person involved may be allowed to intervene in the hearing and to present testimony. Any such hearing shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, except that the parties shall not be bound by rules of evidence, whether statutory, common law, or adopted by a court. A transcript shall be kept of the hearing. After such a hearing the Board, in its discretion, may upon notice receive further evidence or hear argument.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Findings of fact relative to issuance of orders; backpay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) determines after any hearing on a complaint under subsection (f) of this section that the preponderance of the evidence received demonstrates that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, then the individual or individuals conducting the hearing shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the Department or labor organization an order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice in which the Department or labor organization is engaged;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Findings of fact requiring dismissal of complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the individual or individuals conducting the hearing determine that the preponderance of the evidence received fails to demonstrate that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, the individual or individuals shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.</p>
