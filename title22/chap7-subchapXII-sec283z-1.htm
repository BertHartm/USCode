Upon adoption of these resolutions, the United States Governor is authorized on behalf of the United States (A) to subscribe to two hundred twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and ninety-six shares of the increase in the authorized capital stock of the Bank, of which two hundred ten thousand eight hundred and four shall be callable and seventeen thousand and ninety-two shall be paid-in, and (B) to contribute to the Fund for Special Operations $630,000,000; except that any commitment to make such subscriptions to paid-in and callable capital stock and to make such contributions to the Fund for Special Operations shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</p>
