<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In 2008 the Financial Action Task Force extended its mandate to include addressing &ldquo;new and emerging threats such as proliferation financing&rdquo;, meaning the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and published &ldquo;guidance papers&rdquo; for members to assist them in implementing various United Nations Security Council resolutions dealing with weapons of mass destruction, including United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1803 (2008), which deal specifically with proliferation by Iran.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8513a. Imposition of sanctions with respect to the financial sector of Iran</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) On November 21, 2011, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a finding under section 5318A of title 31 that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, &ldquo;The Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of dollars to these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI transferred several billion dollars to designated banks, including Saderat, Mellat, EDBI and Melli, through a variety of payment schemes. In making these transfers, the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing the direct involvement of large international banks with both CBI and designated Iranian banks.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) On November 22, 2011, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David Cohen, wrote, &ldquo;Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking sector, including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist financing, proliferation financing, and money laundering risks for the global financial system.&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of financial sector of Iran as of primary money laundering concern</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The financial sector of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, is designated as a primary money laundering concern for purposes of section 5318A of title 31 because of the threat to government and financial institutions resulting from the illicit activities of the Government of Iran, including its pursuit of nuclear weapons, support for international terrorism, and efforts to deceive responsible financial institutions and evade sanctions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Freezing of assets of Iranian financial institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), block and prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in property of an Iranian financial institution if such property and interests in property are in the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within the possession or control of a United States person.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1717 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Imposition of sanctions with respect to the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian financial institutions</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application of sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (D), sanctions imposed under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply with respect to a financial transaction conducted or facilitated by a foreign financial institution on or after the date that is 180 days after December 31, 2011, for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran if the President determines pursuant to subparagraph (B) that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under paragraph (1) for a period of not more than 120 days, and may renew that waiver for additional periods of not more than 120 days, if the President&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The work of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence of the Department of the Treasury, which includes the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, is critical to ensuring that the international financial system is not used for purposes of supporting terrorism and developing weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury has designated, including most recently on June 16, 2010, various Iranian individuals and banking, military, energy, and shipping entities as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction pursuant to Executive Order 13382 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), thereby blocking transactions subject to the jurisdiction of the United States by those individuals and entities and their supporters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary of the Treasury has also identified an array of entities in the insurance, petroleum, and petrochemicals industries that the Secretary has determined to be owned or controlled by the Government of Iran and added those entities to the list contained in Appendix A to part 560 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly known as the &ldquo;Iranian Transactions Regulations&rdquo;), thereby prohibiting transactions between United States persons and those entities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations for Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Treasury for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $102,613,000 for fiscal year 2011; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2012 and 2013.</p>
