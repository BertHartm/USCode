<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In 2008 the Financial Action Task Force extended its mandate to include addressing &ldquo;new and emerging threats such as proliferation financing&rdquo;, meaning the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and published &ldquo;guidance papers&rdquo; for members to assist them in implementing various United Nations Security Council resolutions dealing with weapons of mass destruction, including United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1803 (2008), which deal specifically with proliferation by Iran.</p>
