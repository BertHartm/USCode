Whenever a proposed reprograming exceeds $1,000,000 and the total amount proposed for obligation for a country under this chapter in a fiscal year exceeds by more than $5,000,000 the amount specified for that country in the report required by section 2413(a) of this title, notifications of such proposed reprogramings shall specify&mdash;</p>
