<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent not inconsistent with treaties or international agreements entered into by the United States, the Secretary, on a calendar quarterly basis beginning January 1, 1991, shall charge and collect from each commercial airline and passenger cruise ship line transporting passengers to the United States, a United States Travel and Tourism Administration Facilitation Fee, in an amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the period from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 1991, the Secretary shall charge each commercial airline and passenger cruise ship line an amount equal to one dollar multiplied by the number of aliens described in section 1101(a)(15)(B) of title 8 arriving at any port within the United States aboard a commercial aircraft or cruise ship of such airline or passenger cruise ship line during that calendar quarter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Commencing in 1991, the Secretary shall each year determine and publish the amount of the fee described in subsection (a) of this section for the 12-month period commencing on January 1 of the succeeding calendar year, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary (in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State) shall estimate the number of aliens described in section 1101(a)(15)(B) of title 8 expected to enter the United States during such succeeding calendar year, based upon the number of such aliens who entered the United States during the previous calendar year (as reported or estimated by the Attorney General) and such other available information as the Secretary deems reliable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall divide the amount appropriated to the United States Travel and Tourism Administration for the fiscal year during which such determination is made by the number of aliens described in subparagraph (A) expected by the Secretary to enter the United States during the calendar year described in such subparagraph, as estimated by the Secretary under such subparagraph, and shall round the result up to the nearest quarter-dollar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the estimate required by subparagraph (A), together with a description of the information supporting such estimate, and the amount of the fee determined under subparagraph (B) which shall be applicable during <!-- PDFPage:404 -->the 12-month period commencing on January 1 of the succeeding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For each calendar quarter beginning after December 31, 1991, the Secretary shall charge each commercial airline and passenger cruise ship line an amount equal to the fee amount determined under subparagraph (B) and applicable under subparagraph (C) multiplied by the number of aliens described in section 1101(a)(15)(B) of title 8 arriving at any port within the United States aboard a commercial aircraft or cruise ship of such airline or passenger cruise ship line during that calendar quarter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Neither the estimate of the Secretary under paragraph (2)(A) nor the amount determined by the Secretary under paragraph (2)(B) shall be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each commercial airline and passenger cruise ship line shall remit the fee charged by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section, in United States dollars, no later than 31 days after the close of the calendar quarter of the arrival of the aliens on which the calculation of the fee is based.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Disposition of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall deposit the fees received pursuant to subsection (c) of this section in the general fund of the Treasury as offsetting receipts and ascribed to the travel and tourism activities of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Aggregate amounts collected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning on October 1, 1992, the aggregate amounts collected for the fee charged under this section shall at least equal the appropriations made for the travel and tourism activities of the Secretary under this chapter, but at no time shall the aggregate of amounts collected for any fiscal year under this section exceed 105 percent of the aggregate of appropriations made for such fiscal year for activities to be funded by such fees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rules and regulations</h4>
