<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that in furnishing assistance under subchapter I of this chapter excess personal property, or (if a substantial savings would occur) other property already owned by an agency of the United States Government, shall be utilized wherever practicable in lieu of or supplementary to the procurement of new items for United States-assisted projects and programs. The President is authorized to maintain in a separate account, which shall, notwithstanding section 1535(d) of title 31, be free from fiscal year limitation, $5,000,000 of funds made available under part I of subchapter I of this chapter, which may be used to pay costs (including personnel costs) of acquisition, storage, renovation and rehabilitation, packing, crating, handling, transportation, and related costs of property classified as domestic or foreign excess property pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.), any property available from an agency of the United States Government, or other property, in advance of known requirements therefor for use in furtherance of the purposes of subchapter I of this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That the amount of property classified as domestic excess property pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, held at any one time pursuant to this section shall not exceed $15,000,000 in total original acquisition cost. Property acquired pursuant to the preceding sentence may be furnished (1) pursuant to any provision of subchapter I of this chapter for which funds are authorized for the furnishing of assistance, in which case the separate account established pursuant to this section shall be repaid from funds made available for such provision for all costs incurred, or (2) pursuant to section 2357 of this title, in which case such separate account shall be repaid in accordance with the provisions of that section for all costs incurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Property classified as domestic excess property under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.], shall not be transferred to the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter for use pursuant to the provisions of subchapter I of this chapter or section 2357 of this title unless (1) such property is transferred for use exclusively by an agency of the United States Government, or (2) it has been determined in the same manner as provided for surplus property in section 203(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 484(j)], that such property is not needed for donation pursuant to that subsection. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to the transfer in any fiscal year for use pursuant to the provisions of subchapter I of this chapter of amounts of such property with a total original acquisition cost to the United States Government not exceeding $45,000,000.</p>
