<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;HELP Commission Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that, despite the long-standing efforts and resources of the United States dedicated to helping needy people around the world, despair remains and in many areas is growing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Therefore, a commission should be established to bring together the best minds associated with development and humanitarian assistance to make a comprehensive review of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) policy decisions, including why certain development projects are funded and others are not, successes, and best practices, including their applicability to other existing programs and projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) delivery obstacles, including the roles of United States agencies and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) methodology, including whether the delivery of United States development assistance always represents best practices and whether it can be improved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) results, including measuring improvements in human capacity instead of in purely economic terms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An examination of these issues should present new approaches and ideas to ensure that United States development assistance reaches and benefits its intended recipients.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of Commission; responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is established the Helping to Enhance the Livelihood of People (HELP) Around the Globe Commission (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify the past and present objectives of United States development assistance, identify cases in which those objectives have been met, identify the beneficiaries of such assistance, and what percentage of the funds provided actually reached the intended beneficiaries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify cases in which United States development assistance has been most successful, and analyze how such successes may be transferable to other countries or areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) study ways to expand educational opportunities and investments in people, and assess infrastructure needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) analyze how the United States could place conditions on governments in countries receiving United States development assistance, in light of and notwithstanding the objectives of the Millennium Challenge Account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) analyze ways in which the United States can coordinate its development assistance programs with those of other donor countries and international organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) analyze ways in which the safety of development assistance workers can be ensured, particularly in the midst of conflicts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) compare the effectiveness of increased and open trade with development assistance, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such trade and whether such trade could be a more effective alternative to United States development assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) analyze ways in which the United States can strengthen the capacity of indigenous nongovernmental organizations to be more effective in grassroots development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) analyze ways in which decisions on providing development assistance can involve more of the people of the recipient countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) analyze ways in which results can be measured if United States development assistance is targeted to the least developed countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) recommend standards that should be set for &ldquo;graduating&rdquo; recipient countries from United States development assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(L) analyze whether United States development assistance should be used as a means to achieve United States foreign policy objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(M) analyze how the United States can evaluate the performance of its development assistance programs not only against economic indicators, but in other ways, including how to measure the success of United States development assistance in democratization efforts; and evaluate the existing foreign assistance framework to ascertain the degree of coordination, or lack thereof, of the disparate foreign development programs as administered by the various Federal agencies, to identify and assess the redundancies of programs and organizational structures engaged in foreign assistance, and to recommend revisions to authorizing legislation for foreign assistance that would seek to reconcile competing foreign policy and foreign aid goals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(N) study any other areas that the Commission considers necessary relating to United States development assistance.</p>
