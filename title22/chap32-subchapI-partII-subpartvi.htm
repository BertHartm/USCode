<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Access to financial services and the development of microenterprise are vital factors in the stable growth of developing countries and in the development of free, open, and equitable international economic systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is therefore in the best interest of the United States to facilitate access to financial services and assist the development of microenterprise in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Access to financial services and the development of microenterprises can be supported by programs providing credit, savings, training, technical assistance, business development services, and other financial services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Given the relatively high percentage of populations living in rural areas of developing countries, and the combined high incidence of poverty in rural areas and growing income inequality between rural and urban markets, microenterprise programs should target both rural and urban poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Microenterprise programs have been successful and should continue to empower vulnerable women in the developing world. The Agency should work to ensure that recipients of microenterprise and microfinance development assistance under this subpart communicate and work with nongovernmental organizations and government organizations to identify and assist victims of trafficking as provided for in section 7104(a)(1) of this title and women who are victims of or susceptible to other forms of exploitation and violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Given that microenterprise programs have been successful in empowering disenfranchised groups such as women, microenterprise programs should also target populations disenfranchised due to race or ethnicity in countries where a strong relationship between poverty and race or ethnicity has been demonstrated, such as countries in Latin America.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;484, &sect;2, Dec. 23, 2004, 118 Stat. 3922, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:547 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Congress has demonstrated its support for microenterprise development assistance programs through the enactment of two comprehensive microenterprise laws:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) The Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 (title I of Public Law 106&ndash;309; 114 Stat. 1082) [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title].</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Public Law 108&ndash;31 [see Tables for classification] (an Act entitled &lsquo;An Act to amend the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase assistance for the poorest people in developing countries under microenterprise assistance program under those Acts, and for other purposes&rsquo;, approved June 17, 2003).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The report on the effectiveness of the United States Agency for International Development's microfinance program, prepared by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, rated the Agency in the top tier of the 17 donors in this field.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Comptroller General, in a report dated November 2003, found that the United States Agency for International Development has met some, but not all, of the key objectives of such microenterprise development assistance programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Comptroller General's report found, among other things, the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Microenterprise development assistance generally can help alleviate some impacts of poverty, improve income levels and quality of life for borrowers and provide poor individuals, workers, and their families with an important coping mechanism.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Microenterprise development assistance programs of the United States Agency for International Development have encouraged women's participation in microfinance projects and, according to data of the Agency, women have comprised two-thirds or more of the micro-loan clients in Agency-funded microenterprise projects since 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The Comptroller General's report recommends that the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development review the Agency's &lsquo;microenterprise results reporting&rsquo; system with the goal of ensuring that its annual reporting is complete and accurate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Specifically, the Administrator should review and reconsider the methodologies used for the collection, analysis, and reporting of data on annual spending targets, outreach to the very poor, sustainability of microfinance institutions, and the contribution of Agency's funding to the institutions it supports.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;484, &sect;7, Dec. 23, 2004, 118 Stat. 3930, provided that: &ldquo;It is the sense of Congress that, in carrying out title VI of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2211 et seq.] (as added by section 3 of this Act and amended by sections 4 through 6 of this Act), the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) where applicable, should ensure that microenterprise development assistance provided under such title is matched by recipients with an equal amount of assistance from non-United States Government sources, including private donations, multilateral funding, commercial and concessional borrowing, savings, and program income;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) should include in the report required by section 258 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2214] (as added by section 6 of this Act) a description of all matching assistance (as described in paragraph (1)) provided for the prior year by recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) should ensure that recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title do not expend an unreasonably large percentage of such assistance on administrative costs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) should not use recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title to carry out critical management functions of the Agency, including functions such as strategy development or overall management of programs in a country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) should consult with the appropriate congressional committees with respect to the implementation of title VI of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 23, 2004].&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Declarations of Policy of 2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;309, title I, &sect;102, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1079, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings and declarations:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) According to the World Bank, more than 1,200,000,000 people in the developing world, or one-fifth of the world's population, subsist on less than $1 a day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Over 32,000 of their children die each day from largely preventable malnutrition and disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads and less access to educational and economic opportunities than their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health and education, as women in particular reinvest income in their families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly women, generally lack stable employment and social safety nets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial portion of their livelihood. In Africa, over 80 percent of employment is generated in the informal sector of the self-employed poor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-employment activities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:551 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their businesses dramatically when they can access loans at reasonable interest rates.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Through the development of self-sustaining microfinance programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against hunger and poverty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6)(A) On February 2&ndash;4, 1997, a global Microcredit Summit was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a plan to expand access to credit for self-employment and other financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's poorest families, especially the women of those families, by 2005. While this scale of outreach may not be achievable in this short time-period, the realization of this goal could dramatically alter the face of global poverty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) With an average family size of five, achieving this goal will mean that the benefits of microfinance will thereby reach nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 absolute poor people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7)(A) Nongovernmental organizations, such as those that comprise the Microenterprise Coalition (such as the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh), K&ndash;REP (Kenya), and networks such as Accion International, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), and the credit union movement) are successful in lending directly to the very poor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Microfinance institutions such as BRAC (Bangladesh), BancoSol (Bolivia), SEWA Bank (India), and ACEP (Senegal) are regulated financial institutions that can raise funds directly from the local and international capital markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) Microenterprise institutions not only reduce poverty, but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Interest income on the credit portfolio is used to pay recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term sustainability of development assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Microfinance institutions leverage foreign assistance resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits to program participants.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) The development of sustainable microfinance institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize domestic savings, is a critical component to a global strategy of poverty reduction and broad-based economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) In the efforts of the United States to lead the development of a new global financial architecture, microenterprise should play a vital role. The recent shocks to international financial markets demonstrate how the financial sector can shape the destiny of nations. Microfinance can serve as a powerful tool for building a more inclusive financial sector which serves the broad majority of the world's population including the very poor and women and thus generate more social stability and prosperity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) Over the last two decades, the United States has been a global leader in promoting the global microenterprise sector, primarily through its development assistance programs at the United States Agency for International Development. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State have used their authority to promote microenterprise in the development programs of international financial institutions and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International Development launched the &lsquo;Microenterprise Initiative&rsquo; in partnership with the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, by the end of fiscal year 1996, one-half of all microenterprise resources would support programs and institutions that provide credit to the poorest, with loans under $300.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, increased investment in microfinance institutions serving the poorest will be critical.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit will require only a small increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microfinance institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) These institutions need assistance in developing their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap commercial sources of capital.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated competence in developing networks of local microfinance institutions and other assistance delivery mechanisms so that they reach large numbers of the very poor, and achieve financial sustainability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) Recognizing that the United States Agency for International Development has developed very effective partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the Agency will have fewer missions overseas to carry out its work, the Agency should place priority on investing in those nongovernmental network institutions that meet performance criteria through the central funding mechanisms of the Agency.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) By expanding and replicating successful microfinance institutions, it should be possible to create a global infrastructure to provide financial services to the world's poorest families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17)(A) The United States can provide leadership to other bilateral and multilateral development agencies as such agencies expand their support to the microenterprise sector.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The United States should seek to improve coordination among G&ndash;7 countries in the support of the microenterprise sector in order to leverage the investment of the United States with that of other donor nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Through increased support for microenterprise, especially credit for the poorest, the United States can continue to play a leadership role in the global effort to expand financial services and opportunity to 100,000,000 of the poorest families on the planet.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Purposes of 2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;309, title I, &sect;103, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1081, as amended by Pub.
