<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7621. Sense of Congress on public-private partnerships</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Innovative partnerships between governments and organizations in the private sector (including foundations, universities, corporations, faith-based and community-based organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations) have proliferated in recent years, particularly in the area of health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Public-private sector partnerships multiply local and international capacities to strengthen the delivery of health services in developing countries and to accelerate research for vaccines and other pharmaceutical products that are essential to combat infectious diseases decimating the populations of these countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) These partnerships maximize the unique capabilities of each sector while combining financial and other resources, scientific knowledge, and expertise toward common goals which neither the public nor the private sector can achieve alone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and building new ones are critical to the success of the international community's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases around the globe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sustainment and promotion of public-private partnerships should be a priority element of the strategy pursued by the United States to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other global health crises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the United States should systematically track the evolution of these partnerships and work with others in the public and private sector to profile and build upon those models that are most effective.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings; sense of Congress</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (Public Law 106&ndash;264) [22 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Global Fund is an innovative financing mechanism which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) has made progress in many areas in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) represents the multilateral component of this chapter, extending United States efforts to more than 130 countries around the world.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Global Fund and United States bilateral assistance programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are demonstrating increasingly effective coordination, with each possessing certain comparative advantages in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) often work most effectively in concert with each other.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The United States Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is the largest supporter of the Global Fund in terms of resources and technical support;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) made the founding contribution to the Global Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) is fully committed to the success of the Global Fund as a multilateral public-private partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) transparency and accountability are crucial to the long-term success and viability of the Global Fund;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Global Fund has made significant progress toward addressing concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) improving risk assessment and risk management capabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) providing clearer guidance for and oversight of Local Fund Agents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) strengthening the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the provision of sufficient resources and authority to the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund to ensure that office has the staff and independence necessary to carry out its mandate will be a measure of the commitment of the Global Fund to transparency and accountability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) regular, publicly published financial, programmatic, and reporting audits of the Fund, its grantees, and Local Fund Agents are also important benchmarks of transparency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the Global Fund should establish and maintain a system to track&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of funds disbursed to each subrecipient on the grant's fiscal cycle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the distribution of resources, by grant and principal recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, drug and commodity purchases, and other purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) relevant national authorities in recipient countries should exempt from duties and taxes all products financed by Global Fund grants and procured by any principal recipient or subrecipient for the purpose of carrying out such grants;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1628 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and the Global AIDS Coordinator should work together to standardize program indicators wherever possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) for purposes of evaluating total amounts of funds contributed to the Global Fund under subsection (d)(4)(A)(i), the timetable for evaluations of contributions from sources other than the United States should take into account the fiscal calendars of other major contributors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the Global Fund should not support activities involving the &ldquo;Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria&rdquo; or similar entities pending compelling evidence of success from pilot programs as evaluated by the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority for United States participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) United States participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States is hereby authorized to participate in the Global Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Privileges and immunities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Global Fund shall be considered a public international organization for purposes of section 288 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States Government regards the imposition by recipient countries of taxes or tariffs on goods or services provided by the Global Fund, which are supported through public and private donations, including the substantial contribution of the American people, as inappropriate and inconsistent with standards of good governance. The Global AIDS Coordinator or other representatives of the United States Government shall work with the Global Fund to dissuade governments from imposing such duties, tariffs, or taxes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after May 27, 2003, and annually thereafter for the duration of the Global Fund, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the Global Fund, including contributions pledged to, contributions (including donations from the private sector) received by, and projects funded by the Global Fund, and the mechanisms established for transparency and accountability in the grant-making process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) United States financial participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to any other funds authorized to be appropriated for bilateral or multilateral HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria programs, of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President up to $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2009,,<sup><a href="#7622_1_target" name="7622_1">1</a></sup> and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2013, for contributions to the Global Fund.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) At any time during fiscal years 2009 through 2013, no United States contribution to the Global Fund may cause the total amount of United States Government contributions to the Global Fund to exceed 33 percent of the total amount of funds contributed to the Global Fund from all sources. Contributions to the Global Fund from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund shall not be considered in determining compliance with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If, at any time during any of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the President determines that the Global Fund has provided assistance to a country, the government of which the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of section 2405(j)(1) of title 50, Appendix, has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, then the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal to the amount expended by the Fund to the government of each such country. The President may waive the application of this clause with respect to assistance for Sudan that is overseen by the Southern Country Coordinating Mechanism, including Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile State, and Abyei, if the President determines that the national interest or humanitarian reasons justify such a waiver. The President shall publish each waiver of this clause in the Federal Register and, not later than 15 days before the waiver takes effect, shall consult with the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives regarding the proposed waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) If at any time the President determines that the expenses of the Governing, Administrative, and Advisory Bodies (including the Partnership Forum, the Foundation Board, the Secretariat, and the Technical Review Board) of the Global Fund exceed 10 percent of the total expenditures of the Fund for any 2-year period, the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal the to the average annual amount expended by the Fund for such 2-year period for the expenses of the Governing, Administrative, and Advisory Bodies in excess of 10 percent of the total expenditures of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The President may waive the application of clause (iii) if the President determines that extraordinary circumstances warrant such a waiver. No waiver under this clause may be for any period that exceeds 1 year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) For the purposes of clause (i), &ldquo;funds contributed to the Global Fund from all sources&rdquo; means funds contributed to the Global Fund at any time during fiscal years 2009 through 2013 that are not contributed to fulfill a commitment made for a fiscal year before fiscal year 2009.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) shall be contributed to the Global Fund as soon as practicable, subject to subparagraph (A)(i), after additional contributions to the Global Fund are made from other sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be transferred to the Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally Fund and shall remain available under the same terms and conditions as funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) is authorized to be made available to carry out section 2151b&ndash;2 of this title. Amounts made available under the preceding sentence are in addition to amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Notwithstanding clause (i), after July 31 of each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) is authorized to be made available to carry out sections 2151b&ndash;2, 2151b&ndash;3, and 2151b&ndash;4 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The President may suspend the application of subparagraph (A) with respect to a fiscal year if the President determines that an international health emergency threatens the national security interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The President shall notify the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate not less than 5 days before making a determination under clause (i) with respect to the application of subparagraph (A)(i) and shall include in the notification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a justification as to why increased United States Government contributions to the Global Fund is preferable to increased United States assistance to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria on a bilateral basis; and</p>
