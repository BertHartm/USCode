<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following declarations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States and the international community should support efforts that advance the development of democratic civil authorities and institutions in Afghanistan and the establishment of a new broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-sensitive, and fully representative government in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The United States, in particular, should provide its expertise to meet immediate humanitarian and refugee needs, fight the production and flow of illicit narcotics, and aid in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) By promoting peace and security in Afghanistan and preventing a return to conflict, the United States and the international community can help ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a source for international terrorism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States should support the objectives agreed to on December 5, 2001, in Bonn, Germany, regarding the provisional arrangement for Afghanistan as it moves toward the establishment of permanent institutions and, in particular, should work intensively toward ensuring the future neutrality of Afghanistan, establishing the principle that neighboring countries and other countries in the region do not threaten or interfere in one another's sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence, including supporting diplomatic initiatives to support this goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The special emergency situation in Afghanistan, which from the perspective of the American people combines security, humanitarian, political, law enforcement, and development imperatives, requires that the President should receive maximum flexibility in designing, coordinating, and administering efforts with respect to assistance for Afghanistan and that a temporary special program of such assistance should be established for this purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To foster stability and democratization and to effectively eliminate the causes of terrorism, the United States and the international community should also support efforts that advance the development of democratic civil authorities and institutions in the broader Central Asia region.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Poverty, unemployment, and lack of provision of basic services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States and the international community must significantly increase political, economic, and military support to Afghanistan to ensure its long-term stability and prosperity, and to deny violent extremist groups such as al Qaeda sanctuary in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statements of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The following shall be the policies of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The United States shall vigorously support the people and Government of Afghanistan as they continue to commit to the path toward a government representing and protecting the rights of all Afghans, and shall maintain its long-term commitment to the people of Afghanistan by increased assistance and the continued deployment of United States troops in Afghanistan as long as the Government of Afghanistan supports such United States involvement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In order to reduce the ability of the Taliban and al Qaeda to finance their operations through the opium trade, the President shall engage aggressively <!-- PDFPage:1587 -->with the Government of Afghanistan, countries in the region or otherwise influenced by the trade and transit of narcotics, as well as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners of the United States, and in consultation with Congress, to assess the success of the current Afghan counter-narcotics strategy and to explore additional options for addressing the narcotics crisis in Afghanistan, including possible changes in rules of engagement for NATO and Coalition forces for participation in actions against narcotics trafficking and kingpins, and the provision of comprehensive assistance to farmers who rely on opium for their livelihood, including through the promotion of alternative crops and livelihoods.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The United States shall continue to work with and provide assistance to the Government of Afghanistan to strengthen local and national government institutions and the rule of law, including the training of judges and prosecutors, and to train and equip the Afghan National Security Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States shall continue to call on NATO members participating in operations in Afghanistan to meet their commitments to provide forces and equipment, and to lift restrictions on how such forces can be deployed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The United States shall continue to foster greater understanding and cooperation between the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan by taking the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Facilitating greater communication, including through official mechanisms such as the Tripartite Commission and the Joint Intelligence Operations Center, and by promoting other forms of exchange between the parliaments and civil society of the two countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Urging the Government of Afghanistan to enter into a political dialogue with Pakistan with respect to all issues relating to the border between the two countries, with the aim of establishing a mutually-recognized and monitored border, open to human and economic exchange, and with both countries fully responsible for border security.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Congressional finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that police training programs in Afghanistan have achieved far less return on substantial investment to date and require a substantive review and justification of the means and purposes of such assistance, consequent to any provision of additional resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Assistance authorized</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall make increased efforts, on an urgent basis, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) dramatically improve the capability and effectiveness of United States and international police trainers, mentors, and police personnel for police training programs in Afghanistan, as well as develop a pretraining screening program;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) assist the Government of Afghanistan, in conjunction with the Afghanistan civil security forces and their leadership, in addressing the corruption crisis that is threatening to undermine Afghanistan's future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 3, 2007], and every 6 months thereafter until September 30, 2010, the President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on United States efforts to fulfill the requirements of this subsection.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) Take appropriate steps to increase the assistance provided under programs of the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development throughout Afghanistan and to increase the number of personnel of those agencies in Afghanistan as necessary to support the increased assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Relief for Afghan Women and Children</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;81, Dec. 12, 2001, 115 Stat. 811, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In Afghanistan, Taliban restrictions on women's participation in society make it nearly impossible for women to exercise their basic human rights. The Taliban restrictions on Afghan women's freedom of expression, association, and movement deny women full participation in society and, consequently, from effectively securing basic access to work, education, and health care.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Afghanistan has one of the highest infant (165 of 1000) and child (257 of 1000) mortality rates in the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Only 5 percent of rural and 39 percent of urban Afghans have access to safe drinking water.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1593 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It is estimated that 42 percent of all deaths in Afghanistan are due to diarrheal diseases caused by contaminated food and water.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Over one-third of Afghan children under 5 years of age suffer from malnutrition, 85,000 of whom die annually.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Seventy percent of the health care system in Afghanistan is dependent on foreign assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) As of May 1998, only 20 percent of hospital medical and surgical beds dedicated to adults were available for women, and thousands of Afghan women and girls are routinely denied health care.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Women are forbidden to leave their homes without being escorted by a male relative. This prevents many women from seeking basic necessities like health care and food for their children. Doctors, virtually all of whom are male, are also not permitted to provide certain types of care not deemed appropriate by the Taliban.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Before the Taliban took control of Kabul, schools were coeducational, with women accounting for 70 percent of the teaching force. Women represented about 50 percent of the civil service corps, and 40 percent of the city's physicians were women. Today, the Taliban prohibits women from working as teachers, doctors, and in any other occupation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The Taliban prohibit [sic] girls and women from attending school. In 1998, the Taliban ordered the closing of more than 100 privately funded schools where thousands of young women and girls were receiving education and training in skills that would have helped them support themselves and their families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Of the many tens of thousands of war widows in Afghanistan, many are forced to beg for food and to sell their possessions because they are not allowed to work.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Resistance movements courageously continue to educate Afghan girls in secrecy and in foreign countries against Taliban law.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE.</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7536. Promoting secure delivery of humanitarian and other assistance in Afghanistan and expansion of the International Security Assistance Force</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The President has declared his view that the United States should provide significant assistance to Afghanistan so that it is no longer a haven for terrorism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction assistance from the international community is necessary for the safe return of refugees and is critical to the future stability of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Enhanced stability in Afghanistan through an improved security environment is critical to the functioning of the Government of Afghanistan and the traditional Afghan assembly or &ldquo;Loya Jirga&rdquo; process, which is intended to lead to a permanent national government in Afghanistan, and also is essential for the participation of women in Afghan society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Incidents of violence between armed factions and local and regional commanders, and serious abuses of human rights, including attacks on women and ethnic minorities throughout Afghanistan, create an insecure, volatile, and unsafe environment in parts of Afghanistan, displacing thousands of Afghan civilians from their local communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) On July 6, Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir was assassinated in Kabul by unknown assailants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) On September 5, 2002, a car bomb exploded in Kabul killing 32 and injuring 150 and on the same day a member of Kandahar Governor Sherzai's security team attempted to assassinate President Karzai.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The violence and lawlessness may jeopardize the &ldquo;Loya Jirga&rdquo; process, undermine efforts to build a strong central government, severely impede reconstruction and the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and increase the likelihood that parts of Afghanistan will once again become safe havens for al-Qaida, Taliban forces, and drug traffickers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The lack of security and lawlessness may also perpetuate the need for United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan and threaten the ability of the United States to meet its military objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, currently led by Turkey, and composed of forces from other willing countries without the participation of United States Armed Forces, is deployed only in Kabul and currently does not have the mandate or the capacity to provide security to other parts of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Due to the ongoing military campaign in Afghanistan, the United States does not contribute troops to the International Security Assistance Force but has provided support to other countries that are doing so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The United States is providing political, financial, training, and other assistance to the <!-- PDFPage:1597 -->Afghan Interim Authority as it begins to build a national army and police force to help provide security throughout Afghanistan, but this effort is not meeting the immediate security needs of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Because of these immediate security needs, the Government of Afghanistan, its President, Hamid Karzai, and many Afghan regional leaders have called for the International Security Assistance Force, which has successfully brought stability to Kabul, to be expanded and deployed throughout the country, and this request has been strongly supported by a wide range of international humanitarian organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Catholic Relief Services, and Refugees International.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It should be the policy of the United States to support measures to help meet the immediate security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil order, and support the formation of a functioning, representative Afghan national government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation of strategy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 60 days after December 4, 2002, the President shall provide the Committee on International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a strategy for meeting the immediate and long-term security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil order, and support the formation of a functioning, representative Afghan national government, including an update to the strategies submitted pursuant to Public Law 107&ndash;206; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a description of the progress of the Government of Afghanistan toward the eradication of poppy cultivation, the disruption of heroin production, and the reduction of the overall supply and demand for illicit narcotics in Afghanistan in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation of strategy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Every 6 months after December 4, 2002, through January 1, 2010, the President shall submit to the congressional committees specified in paragraph (1) a report on the implementation of the strategies for meeting the immediate and long-term security needs of Afghanistan, which shall include the following elements&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the degree to which armed regional leaders are cooperating and integrating with the central government, providing security and order within their regions of influence, engaging in armed conflict or other forms of competition that are deleterious to peace, security, and the integration of a unified Afghanistan under the central government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of humanitarian relief provided since the previous report to returnees, isolated populations and other vulnerable groups, as well as demining assistance and landmine survivors rehabilitation; and the numbers of such persons not assisted since the previous report;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the numbers of Civil Affairs Teams working with regional leaders, as well as the quick impact infrastructure projects undertaken by such teams since the previous report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) efforts undertaken since the previous report to rebuild the justice sector, including the establishment of a functioning judiciary, a competent bar, reintegration of women legal professionals and a reliable penal system, and the respect for human rights; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) a description of the progress of the Government of Afghanistan with respect to the matters described in paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Expansion of the International Security Assistance Force</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Efforts to expand international peacekeeping and security operations in Afghanistan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Efforts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President shall encourage, and, as authorized by law, enable other countries to actively participate in expanded international peacekeeping and security operations in Afghanistan, especially through the provision of military personnel for extended periods of time.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President shall prepare and transmit a report on the efforts carried out pursuant to subparagraph (A) to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives. The first report under this subparagraph shall be transmitted not later than 60 days after December 17, 2004, and subsequent reports shall be trans<!-- PDFPage:1598 -->mitted every 6 months thereafter and may be included in the report required by subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authorization of appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Funds appropriated pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be subject to the notification requirements under section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2394&ndash;1].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) United States policy relating to international peacekeeping and security operations</h4>
