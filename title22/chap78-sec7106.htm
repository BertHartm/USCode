<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Minimum standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking applicable to the government of a country of origin, transit, or destination for a significant number of victims of severe forms of trafficking are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The government of the country should prohibit severe forms of trafficking in persons and punish acts of such trafficking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For the knowing commission of any act of sex trafficking involving force, fraud, coercion, or in which the victim of sex trafficking is a child incapable of giving meaningful consent, or of trafficking which includes rape or kidnapping or which causes a death, the government of the country should prescribe punishment commensurate with that for grave crimes, such as forcible sexual assault.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For the knowing commission of any act of a severe form of trafficking in persons, the government of the country should prescribe punishment that is sufficiently stringent to deter and that adequately reflects the heinous nature of the offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The government of the country should make serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determinations under subsection (a)(4) of this section, the following factors should be considered as indicia of serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Whether the government of the country vigorously investigates and prosecutes acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons that take place wholly or partly within the territory of the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Whether the government of the country protects victims of severe forms of trafficking <!-- PDFPage:1454 -->in persons and encourages their assistance in the investigation and prosecution of such trafficking, including provisions for legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they would face retribution or hardship, and ensures that victims are not inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Whether the government of the country has adopted measures to prevent severe forms of trafficking in persons, such as measures to inform and educate the public, including potential victims, about the causes and consequences of severe forms of trafficking in persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether the government of the country cooperates with other governments in the investigation and prosecution of severe forms of trafficking in persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Whether the government of the country extradites persons charged with acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons on substantially the same terms and to substantially the same extent as persons charged with other serious crimes (or, to the extent such extradition would be inconsistent with the laws of such country or with international agreements to which the country is a party, whether the government is taking all appropriate measures to modify or replace such laws and treaties so as to permit such extradition).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Whether the government of the country monitors immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of severe forms of trafficking in persons and whether law enforcement agencies of the country respond to any such evidence in a manner that is consistent with the vigorous investigation and prosecution of acts of such trafficking, as well as with the protection of human rights of victims and the internationally recognized human right to leave any country, including one's own, and to return to one's own country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Whether the government of the country vigorously investigates and prosecutes public officials who participate in or facilitate severe forms of trafficking in persons, and takes all appropriate measures against officials who condone such trafficking.</p>
