<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance under any provision of this chapter may, unless sooner terminated by the President, be terminated by concurrent resolution. Funds made available under this chapter shall remain available for a period not to exceed eight months from the date of termination of assistance under this chapter for the necessary expenses of winding up programs related thereto. In order to ensure the effectiveness of assistance under this chapter, such expenses for orderly termination of programs may include the obligation and expenditure of funds to complete the training or studies outside their countries of origin of students whose course of study or training program began before assistance was terminated. Such expenses for orderly termination of programs under the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] may include the obligation and expenditure of funds to complete the training or studies outside the countries of origin of students whose course of study or training program began before assistance was terminated, as long as the origin country's termination was not a result of activities beyond default of financial responsibilities.</p>
