<p class="statutory-body">The President having terminated governmental relations between the United States and the governing authorities on Taiwan recognized by the United States as the Republic of China prior to January 1, 1979, the Congress finds that the enactment of this chapter is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to help maintain peace, security, and stability in the Western Pacific; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to promote the foreign policy of the United States by authorizing the continuation of commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China mainland and all other peoples of the Western Pacific area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to declare that peace and stability in the area are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States, and are matters of international concern;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to make clear that the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Human rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this chapter shall contravene the interest of the United States in human rights, especially with respect to the human rights of all the approximately eighteen million inhabitants of Taiwan. The preservation and enhancement of the human rights of all the people on Taiwan are hereby reaffirmed as objectives of the United States.</p>
