<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Delegation by President; rules and regulations; utilization of goods and services from private enterprise, and facilities and resources of Federal agencies when not competitive with private enterprise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may exercise any functions conferred upon him by this chapter through such agency or officer of the United States Government as he shall direct. The head of any such agency or such officer may from time to time promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out such functions, and may delegate authority to perform any such functions, including, if he shall so specify, the authority successively to redelegate any of such functions to any of his subordinates. In providing technical assistance under this chapter, the head of any such agency or such officer shall utilize, to the fullest extent practicable, goods and professional and other services from private enterprise on a contract basis. In such fields as education, health, housing, or agriculture, the facilities and resources of other Federal agencies shall be utilized when such facilities are particularly or uniquely suitable for technical assistance, are not competitive with private enterprise, and can be made available without interfering unduly with domestic programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:708 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility of suppliers; debarment period; causes for debarment; conditions for reinstatement; periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall issue and enforce regulations determining the eligibility of any person to receive funds made available under this chapter. A person may be suspended under such regulations for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation and any resulting judicial or debarment proceedings, upon cause for belief that such person or an affiliate thereof probably has undertaken conduct which constitutes a cause for debarment; and, after an opportunity has been afforded to such person for a hearing, he may be debarred for an additional period, not to exceed three years. Among the causes for debarment shall be (1) offering or accepting a bribe or other illegal payment or credit in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (2) committing a fraud in the procurement or performance of any contract financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (3) acting in any other manner which shows a lack of integrity or honesty in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter. Reinstatement of eligibility in each particular case shall be subject to such conditions as the President shall direct. Each person whose eligibility is denied or suspended under this subsection shall, upon request, be entitled to a review of his eligibility not less often than once every two years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;HELP Commission Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that, despite the long-standing efforts and resources of the United States dedicated to helping needy people around the world, despair remains and in many areas is growing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Therefore, a commission should be established to bring together the best minds associated with development and humanitarian assistance to make a comprehensive review of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) policy decisions, including why certain development projects are funded and others are not, successes, and best practices, including their applicability to other existing programs and projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) delivery obstacles, including the roles of United States agencies and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) methodology, including whether the delivery of United States development assistance always represents best practices and whether it can be improved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) results, including measuring improvements in human capacity instead of in purely economic terms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An examination of these issues should present new approaches and ideas to ensure that United States development assistance reaches and benefits its intended recipients.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of Commission; responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is established the Helping to Enhance the Livelihood of People (HELP) Around the Globe Commission (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify the past and present objectives of United States development assistance, identify cases in which those objectives have been met, identify the beneficiaries of such assistance, and what percentage of the funds provided actually reached the intended beneficiaries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify cases in which United States development assistance has been most successful, and analyze how such successes may be transferable to other countries or areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) study ways to expand educational opportunities and investments in people, and assess infrastructure needs;</p>
