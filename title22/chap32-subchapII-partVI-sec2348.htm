<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 94&ndash;110, Oct. 13, 1975, 89 Stat. 572, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang1">&ldquo;Whereas an agreement signed on September 4, 1975, by the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of Israel may, when it enters into force, constitute a significant step toward peace in the Middle East;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang1">&ldquo;Whereas the President of the United States on September 1, 1975, transmitted to the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and to the Government of Israel identical proposals for United States participation in an early-warning system, the text of which has been submitted to the Congress, providing for the assignment of no more than two hundred United States civilian personnel to carry out certain specified noncombat functions and setting forth the terms and conditions thereof;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang1">&ldquo;Whereas that proposal would permit the Government of the United States to withdraw such personnel if it concludes that their safety is jeopardized or that continuation of their role is no longer necessary; and</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang1">&ldquo;Whereas the implementation of the United States proposals for the early-warning system in Sinai may enhance the prospect of compliance in good faith with the terms of the Egyptian-Israeli agreements and thereby promote the cause of peace: Now, therefore, be it</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>&ldquo;Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That the President is authorized to implement the &lsquo;United States Proposal for the Early Warning System in Sinai&rsquo;: <em>Provided, however</em>, That United States civilian personnel assigned to Sinai under such proposal shall be removed immediately in the event of an outbreak of hostilities between Egypt and Israel or if the Congress by concurrent resolution determines that the safety of such personnel is jeopardized or that continuation of their role is no longer necessary. Nothing contained in this resolution shall be construed as granting any authority to the President with respect to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities or <!-- PDFPage:692 -->into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances which authority he would not have had in the absence of this joint resolution.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. Any concurrent resolution of the type described in the first section of this resolution which is introduced in either House of Congress shall be privileged in the same manner and to the same extent as a concurrent resolution of the type described in section 5(c) of Public Law 93&ndash;148 [section 1544(c) of Title 50, War and National Defense] is privileged under section 7 of such law [section 1546 of title 50, War and National Defense].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. The United States civilian personnel participating in the early warning system in Sinai shall include only individuals who have volunteered to participate in such system.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. Whenever United States civilian personnel, pursuant to this resolution, participate in an early warning system, the President shall, so long as the participation of such personnel continues, submit written reports to the Congress periodically, but no less frequently than once every six months, on (1) the status, scope, and anticipated duration of their participation, and (2) the feasibility of ending or reducing as soon as possible their participation by substituting nationals of other countries or by making technological changes. The appropriate committees of the Congress shall promptly hold hearings on each report of the President and report to the Congress any findings, conclusions, and recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. The authority contained in this joint resolution to implement the &lsquo;United States Proposal for the Early Warning System in Sinai&rsquo; does not signify approval of the Congress of any other agreement, understanding, or commitment made by the executive branch.&rdquo;</p>
