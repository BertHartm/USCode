<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the development-oriented international financial institutions have proved themselves capable of playing a significant role in assist<!-- PDFPage:29 -->ing economic development by providing to less developed countries access to capital and technical assistance and soliciting from them maximum self-help and mutual cooperation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) this has been achieved with minimal risk of financial loss to contributing countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such institutions have proved to be an effective mechanism for sharing the burden among developed countries of stimulating economic development in the less developed world; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) although continued United States participation in the international financial institutions is an important part of efforts by the United States to assist less developed countries, more of this burden should be shared by other developed countries. As a step in that direction, in future negotiations, the United States should work toward aggregate contributions to future replenishments to international financial institutions covered by this Act not to exceed 25 per centum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding commitments to international financial institutions; availability of funds subject to appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that economic development is a long-term process needing funding commitments to international financial institutions. It also notes that the availability of funds for the United States contribution to international financial institutions is subject to the appropriations process.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration of intent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">United States active participation in international financial institution activity is based on our national objective of furthering the economic and social development of the nations of the world, in particular the developing nations. The attainment of this national objective is most effectively realized through a world economic and financial system which is both free and stable. Therefore, it is the intent of the United States Congress that United States financial assistance to the international financial institutions should be primarily directed to those projects that would not generate excess commodity supplies in world markets, displace private investment initiatives or foster departures from a market-oriented economy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of country adjustment programs; minimization of projected adverse impacts; avoidance of government subsidization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the representatives of the United States to the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) of this section to take into account in their review of loans, credits, or other utilization of the resources of their respective institutions, the effect that country adjustment programs would have upon individual industry sectors and international commodity markets in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) minimize any projected adverse impacts on such sector or markets of making such loans, credits, or utilization of resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) avoid whenever possible government subsidization of production and exports of international commodities without regard to economic conditions in the markets for such commodities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Project proposals relating to mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">More specifically, the following criteria should be considered as a basis for a vote by the respective United States Executive Director to each of the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) of this section against a project proposal involving the creation of new capacity or the expansion, improvement, or modification of mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Analysis shows that the risks, returns, and incentives of a project are such that it could be financed at reasonable terms by commercial lending services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Analysis by the United States Bureau of Mines indicates that surplus capacity in the industry for the primary product of the defined project would exist over half the period of the economic life of the project because of projected world demand and capacity conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States imports of the commodity constitute less than 50 percent of the domestic production of the primary product in those cases where the United States is the substantial producer of such commodities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) International financial institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The international financial institutions referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section are the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the illicit narcotics epidemic currently afflicting the United States represents a direct threat to the well-being of every United States citizen;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director for each multilateral development bank to vigorously and continually advocate, in all replenishment negotiations and in discussion with other directors of such bank and with such bank, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A major objective of such bank's operations and financing in each borrowing country, as a long term priority, should be to increase the productive role of the poor in the economy of such country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such bank should encourage and assist each borrowing country to develop sustainable national plans and strategies to eliminate the causes and alleviate the manifestations of poverty which keep the poor from leading economically and socially productive lives. Such plans and strategies should give attention to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the enhancement of human resources, including programs for basic nutrition, primary health services, basic education, and safe water and basic sanitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) access to income-generating activities, employment, and productive assets such as land and credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consultation with public sector social agencies and local non-governmental organizations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) As an integral element of ongoing policy dialogue with each borrowing country to design structural adjustment plans and project lending programs, such bank should provide assistance consistent with achieving the objectives of the country's national plan for increasing the productive economic participation of the poor. Such dialogue should be conducted with government agencies working in social and economic sectors and with non-governmental groups in the borrowing country, especially those that have grassroots involvement with poor people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In an annual review document, such bank should describe the extent to which the goal of increasing the productive economic participation of the poor is being advanced or retarded and the steps that are being taken to overcome obstacles to its fulfillment. Such review should be based on information contained in the bank's country implementation review documents and in the country strategy documents for each borrowing country. Such country strategy documents should describe the national strategy for productive economic participation of the poor and the steps the bank plans to take to assist the borrowing country during the period covered by the country strategy document.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Such bank should assist countries in assessing and monitoring progress in achieving poverty alleviation goals and targets through measurement by appropriate social indicators.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Such bank should adopt procedures and budgetary allocations for administrative purposes, and establish appropriate staffing levels, to ensure that adequate resources are available to implement the bank's program for enhancing the productive economic participation of the poor, in consultation with non-governmental groups.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Such bank should adopt, as a separate and major criterion in the allocation of concessional financing resources, a preferential allocation to each country which undertakes significant efforts to enhance the productive economic participation of the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Such bank should require each country which receives structural adjustment assistance to have in place, after a reasonable phase-in period, a strategy to enhance the productive economic participation of the poor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Progress report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the end of the 1-year period beginning on December 19, 1989, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, a report on the following:</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">In defining the purposes of act July 15, 1946, sections 286<em>l</em> and 286m of this title, Congress stated that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas in the Bretton Woods Agreements Act [this subchapter] the Congress has declared it to be the policy of the United States &lsquo;to seek to bring about further agreement and cooperation among nations and international bodies, as soon as possible, on ways and means which will best reduce obstacles to and restrictions upon international trade, eliminate unfair trade practices, promote mutually advantageous commercial relations, and otherwise facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and promote the stability of international economic relations&rsquo;; and</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas in further implementation of the purposes of the Bretton Woods Agreements, the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have negotiated an agreement dated December 6, 1945, designed to expedite the achievement of stable and orderly exchange arrangements, the prompt elimination of exchange restrictions and discriminations, and other objectives of the above-mentioned policy declared by the Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Financial Agreement Between the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom</h4>
<p class="note-body">It is hereby agreed between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. Effective date of the agreement: The effective date of this Agreement shall be the date on which the Government of the United States notifies the Government of the United Kingdom that the Congress of the United States has made available the funds necessary to extend to the Government of the United Kingdom the line of credit in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Line of credit: The Government of the United States will extend to the Government of the United Kingdom a line of credit of $3,750,000,000 which may be drawn upon at any time between the effective date of this Agreement and December 31, 1951, inclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Purpose of the line of credit: The purpose of the line of credit is to facilitate purchases by the United Kingdom of goods and services in the United States, to assist the United Kingdom to meet transitional post-war deficits in its current balance of payments, to help the United Kingdom to maintain adequate reserves of gold and dollars, and to assist the Government of the United Kingdom to assume the obligations of multilateral trade, as defined in this and other agreements.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Amortization and interest:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The amount of the line of credit drawn by December 31, 1951, shall be repaid in 50 annual installments beginning on December 31, 1951, with interest at the rate of 2 percent per annum. Interest for the year 1951 shall be computed on the amount outstanding on December 31, 1951, and for each year thereafter, interest shall be computed on the amount outstanding on January 1 of each such year.</p>
<p class="note-body">Forty-nine annual installments of principal repayments and interest shall be equal, calculated at the rate of $31,823,000 for each $1,000,000,000 of the line of credit drawn by December 31, 1951, and the fiftieth installment shall be at the rate of $31,840,736.65 for each such $1,000,000,000. Each installment shall consist of the full amount of the interest due and the remainder of the installment shall be the principal to be repaid in that year. Payments required by this section are subject to the provisions of section 5.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:131 --><p class="note-body">(ii) The Government of the United Kingdom may accelerate repayment of the amount drawn under this line of credit.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. Deferment of annual installments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) In any calendar year after December 31, 1956, in which the Government of the United Kingdom advises the Government of the United States that it finds that a deferment is necessary in view of the present and prospective conditions of international exchange and the level of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, the Government of the United Kingdom may defer the payment of the annual installment for that year of principal repayment and interest specified under Section 4. Not more than seven (7) annual installments may be so deferred. The first of any such deferred installments shall be paid on December 31, 2001, and the others shall be paid annually thereafter, in order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) In addition, the installment of interest in respect of the year 1956 is hereby deferred, in lieu of any right of waiver hitherto existing. This installment shall be paid on December 31 of the year following that in which the last of all other installments, including installments deferred under the preceding paragraph, is due.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) Deferred installments shall bear interest at the rate of 2 percent per annum, payable annually on December 31 of each year following that in which deferment occurs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) Payment of deferred installments may be accelerated, in whole or in part, at the option of the Government of the United Kingdom. [Amended Mar. 6, 1957, eff. Apr. 25, 1957.]</p>
<p class="note-body">6. Relation of this line of credit to other obligations. The Government of the United Kingdom undertakes not to defer an installment under Section 5 of this Agreement in any year, unless it also defers the installment due in that year under the Financial Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United Kingdom, dated March 6, 1946. [Amended Mar. 6, 1957, eff. Apr. 25, 1957.]</p>
<p class="note-body">7. Sterling area exchange arrangements: The Government of the United Kingdom will complete arrangements as early as practicable and in any case not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement, unless in exceptional cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, under which immediately after the completion of such arrangements the sterling receipts from current transactions of all sterling area countries (apart from any receipts arising out of military expenditure by the Government of the United Kingdom prior to December 31, 1948, to the extent to which they are treated by agreement with the countries concerned on the same basis as the balances accumulated during the war) will be freely available for current transactions in any currency area without discrimination; with the result that any discrimination arising from the so-called sterling area dollar pool will be entirely removed and that each member of the sterling area will have its current sterling and dollar receipts at its free disposition for current transactions anywhere.</p>
<p class="note-body">8. Other exchange arrangements:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Government of the United Kingdom agrees that after the effective date of this Agreement it will not apply exchange controls in such a manner as to restrict (a) payments or transfers in respect of products of the United States permitted to be imported into the United Kingdom or other current transactions between the two countries or (b) the use of sterling balances to the credit of residents of the United States arising out of current transactions. Nothing in this paragraph (i) shall affect the provisions of Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund when those Articles have come into force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom agree that not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement, unless in exceptional cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, they will impose no restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions. The obligations of this paragraph (ii) shall not apply:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) to balances of third countries and their nationals accumulated before this paragraph (ii) becomes effective; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) to restrictions imposed in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, provided that the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States will not continue to invoke the provisions of Article XIV, Section 2 of those Articles after this paragraph (ii) becomes effective, unless in exceptional cases after consultation they agree otherwise; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) to restrictions imposed in connection with measures designed to uncover and dispose of assets of Germany and Japan.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) This section and section 9, which are in anticipation of more comprehensive arrangements by multilateral agreement, shall operate until December 31, 1951.</p>
<p class="note-body">9. Import arrangements: If either the Government of the United States or the Government of the United Kingdom imposes or maintains quantitative import restrictions, such restrictions shall be administered on a basis which does not discriminate against imports from the other country in respect of any product; provided that this undertaking shall not apply in cases in which (a) its application would have the effect of preventing the country imposing such restrictions from utilizing, for the purchase of needed imports, inconvertible currencies accumulated up to December 31, 1946, or (b) there may be special necessity for the country imposing such restrictions to assist, by measures not involving a substantial departure from the general rule of non-discrimination, a country whose economy has been disrupted by war, or (c) either government imposes quantitative restrictions having equivalent effect to any exchange restrictions which that government is authorized to impose in conformity with Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. The provisions of this section shall become effective as soon as practicable but not later than December 31, 1946.</p>
<p class="note-body">10. Accumulated sterling balances:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The Government of the United Kingdom intends to make agreements with the countries concerned, varying according to the circumstances of each case, for an early settlement covering the sterling balances accumulated by sterling area and other countries prior to such settlement (together with any future receipts arising out of military expenditure by the Government of the United Kingdom to the extent to which they are treated on the same basis by agreement with the countries concerned). The settlements with the sterling area countries will be on the basis of dividing these accumulated balances into three categories (a) balances to be released at once and convertible into any currency for current transactions, (b) balances to be similarly released by installments over a period of years beginning in 1951, and (c) balances to be adjusted as a contribution to the settlement of war and postwar indebtedness and in recognition of the benefits which the countries concerned might be expected to gain from such a settlement. The Government of the United Kingdom will make every endeavor to secure the early completion of these arrangements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) In consideration of the fact that an important purpose of the present line of credit is to promote the development of multilateral trade and facilitate its early resumption on a non-discriminatory basis, the Government of the United Kingdom agrees that any sterling balances released or otherwise available for current payments will, not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement unless in special cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, be freely available for current transactions in any currency area without discrimination.</p>
<p class="note-body">11. Definitions:</p>
<p class="note-body">For the purposes of this Agreement:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The term &ldquo;current transactions&rdquo; shall have the meaning prescribed in Article XIX (i) of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:132 --><p class="note-body">(ii) The term &ldquo;sterling area&rdquo; means the United Kingdom and the other territories declared by the Defence (Finance) Definition of the Sterling Area) (No. 2) Order, 1944, to be included in the sterling area, namely &ldquo;the following territories excluding Canada and Newfoundland, that is to say&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) any Dominion,</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) any other part of His Majesty's dominions,</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) any territory in respect of which a mandate on behalf of the League of Nations has been accepted by His Majesty and is being exercised by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom or in any Dominion,</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) any British protectorate or protected State,</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Egypt, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Iraq.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Iceland and the Faroe Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">12. Consultation on Agreement: Either government shall be entitled to approach the other for a reconsideration of any of the provisions of this Agreement, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions of international exchange justify such reconsideration, with a view to agreeing upon modifications for presentation to their respective legislatures.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such economic adjustment programs should be designed to safeguard, to the maximum extent feasible, international economic growth, world trade, employment, and the long-term solvency of banks, and to minimize the likelihood of civil disturbances in countries needing economic adjustment programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Changes in Fund guidelines; limitations on debt service exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To ensure the effectiveness of economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall oppose and vote against providing assistance from the Fund for any economic adjustment program for a country in which the annual external debt service exceeds 85 per centum of the annual export earnings of such country, unless the Secretary of the Treasury first determines and provides written documentation to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the economic adjustment program converts high interest rate, short-term bank debt into long-term debt at significantly narrower interest rate spreads than the average interest rate spreads prevailing on bank debt reschedulings negotiated between August 1982 and August 1983 for countries receiving assistance from the Fund for economic adjustment programs in order to minimize the burdens of adjustment on the debtor nation, provided that such interest rate spreads are consistent with that nation's need to obtain adequate external private financing;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Probable Exemptions to United Nations Employee Hiring Freeze</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;204, title VII, &sect;701, Dec. 22, 1987, 101 Stat. 1383, as amended by Pub. L. 102&ndash;138, title I, &sect;163, Oct. 28, 1991, 105 Stat. 676, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In April 1986, the Secretary-General of the United Nations adopted a freeze on the hiring of personnel within the United Nations Secretariat.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The conditions of the freeze were such that, as the terms of office for the personnel expired, replacements would not be recruited or hired to fill the vacant positions, with minor exceptions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The freeze was designed to reduce United Nations personnel by 15 percent over three years, as recommended by the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations (commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Group of 18 Experts&rsquo;).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:160 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) On May 5, 1987, the Secretary-General reported to the Department of State that he was considering granting 156 exceptions to the hiring freeze.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Of these 156 probable exceptions, 104 would be Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat&mdash;of 298 Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat&mdash;who would be replaced over the next 18 months.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) According to a report from the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on &lsquo;Soviet Presence in the United Nations Secretariat&rsquo; (Senate Print 99&ndash;52, May 1985), approximately one-fourth of the Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat are intelligence officers, many more are co-opted by the Soviet intelligence agencies, and all Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat must respond to KGB requests for assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Other United States intelligence authorities estimate that as many as one-half of the Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals in the United Nations Secretariat are officers of the KGB or the GRU.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) If the Secretary-General's probable exemptions are adopted, the Soviet Union will be allowed to replace retiring Soviet and Soviet-bloc personnel with new, highly skilled and well-trained intelligence officers of the KGB or the GRU.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Secretary-General's proposed exceptions would thus provide the Soviet Union with the capability to rebuild its intelligence apparatus within the United States, which was devastated in recent years when the United States ordered severe reductions in the size of the Soviet mission to the United Nations, the Soviet Embassy in Washington, District of Columbia, and the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Article 100 of the United Nations Charter calls for the establishment of an international civil service whose members are neutral and loyal only to the United Nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Section 3 of Article 101 of the United Nations Charter calls for the appointment of individuals who are professionally qualified for the positions they are to fill and maintains that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) As of September 1985, 442 of 446 Soviet nationals employed throughout the United Nations system are &lsquo;seconded&rsquo;, that is, serve on short, fixed-term contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Through the abuse of short, fixed-term contracts, the Soviet Union has maintained undue influence and control over major offices of the United Nations Secretariat, thereby effectively using the United Nations Secretariat in the conduct of its foreign relations, in clear violation of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) The Secretary-General's proposed exceptions to the hiring freeze (as described in paragraphs (1) through (5)) would continue the gross violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter described in paragraph (13).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The Secretary-General's proposed exceptions to such hiring freeze would be clearly inconsistent with the terms of the United Nation's self-imposed reform program.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) The United Nations has not yet achieved its reform goals and there is no indication that the United Nations can afford to make such large exceptions to such hiring freeze.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of the Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the President should take all such actions necessary to ensure compliance with the hiring freeze rule, including withholding all assessed United States contributions to the United Nations, and denying United States entry visas to Soviet and Soviet-bloc applicants coming to the United States to replace Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently serving in the United Nations Secretariat;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the President, through the Department of State and the United States mission to the United Nations, should express to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the insistence of the American people that the hiring freeze continue indefinitely, or until the United Nations has complied with the Group of 18 recommendations and can thus afford to make exceptions to the freeze;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Secretary-General should revoke all exceptions to the hiring freeze rule, excepting those member-nations which have 15 or fewer nationals serving in the United Nations Secretariat, or those positions not subject to geographical representation, such as those of the general service category;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the long-term, flagrant violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter and the abuse of secondment by the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc member-nations are reprehensible;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the United Nations should adopt the recommendations of the Group of 18 (as referred to in subsection (a)(3)) that no member-nation be allowed to have more than 50 percent of its nationals employed under fixed-term contracts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Soviet Union is hereby condemned for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) its refusal to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter calling for an international civil service,</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) its abuse of secondment, and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) its absolute disregard of the solemn purpose of the United Nations to be an international civil service; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) if the Soviet Union and the Soviet-bloc intend to remain member-nations of the United Nations, they should adhere to Articles 100, 101, and all other principles of the United Nations Charter to which every other member-nation must adhere.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this section, the term &lsquo;Soviet-bloc&rsquo; means the countries of Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Nicaragua, North Korea, Poland, and Romania.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice to Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall notify the Congress when a decision is made to withhold any <!-- PDFPage:161 -->share of the United States assessed contribution to the United Nations or its specialized agencies pursuant to subsection (a) and shall notify the Congress when the decision is made to pay any previously withheld assessed contribution.

<h4 class="note-head">Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization</h4>
I74the governments of the states parties to this constitution on behalf of their peoples declare<p class="note-body-block">that since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that ignorance of each other's ways and lives has been a common cause, throughout the history of mankind, of that suspicion and mistrust between the peoples of the world through which their differences have all too often broken into war;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that the great and terrible war which has now ended was a war made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that the wide diffusion of culture, and the education of humanity for justice and liberty and peace are indispensable to the dignity of man and constitute a sacred duty which all the nations must fulfill in a spirit of mutual assistance and concern;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of governments would not be a peace which could secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the world, and that the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">for these reasons,</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">the States parties to this Constitution, believing in full and equal opportunities for education for all, in the unrestricted pursuit of objective truth, and in the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, are agreed and determined to develop and to increase the means of communication between their peoples and to employ these means for the purposes of mutual understanding and a truer and more perfect knowledge of each other's lives;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">in consequence whereof</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">they do hereby create the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation for the purpose of <!-- PDFPage:165 -->advancing, through the educational and scientific and cultural relations of the peoples of the world, the objectives of international peace and of the common welfare of mankind for which the United Nations Organisation was established and which its Charter proclaims.</p>

<p class="note-body">2. To realise this purpose the Organisation will:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(<em>a</em>) collaborate in the work of advancing the mutual knowledge and understanding of peoples, through all means of mass communication and to that end recommend such international agreements as may be necessary to promote the free flow of ideas by word and image;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(<em>b</em>) give fresh impulse to popular education and to the spread of culture;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by collaborating with Members, at their request, in the development of educational activities; by instituting collaboration among the nations to advance the ideal of equality of educational opportunity without regard to race, sex or any distinctions, economic or social;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by suggesting educational methods best suited to prepare the children of the world for the responsibilities of freedom;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(<em>c</em>) maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by assuring the conservation and protection of the world's inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science, and recommending to the nations concerned the necessary international conventions;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by encouraging cooperation among the nations in all branches of intellectual activity, including the international exchange of persons active in the fields of education, science and culture and the exchange of publications, objects of artistic and scientific interest and other materials of information;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by initiating methods of international cooperation calculated to give the people of all countries access to the printed and published materials produced by any of them.</p>
