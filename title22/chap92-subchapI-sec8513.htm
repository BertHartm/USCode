<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Financial Action Task Force is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Thirty-three countries, plus the European Commission and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, belong to the Financial Action Task Force. The member countries of the Financial Action Task Force include the United States, Canada, most countries in western Europe, Russia, the People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In 2008 the Financial Action Task Force extended its mandate to include addressing &ldquo;new and emerging threats such as proliferation financing&rdquo;, meaning the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and published &ldquo;guidance papers&rdquo; for members to assist them in implementing various United Nations Security Council resolutions dealing with weapons of mass destruction, including United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1803 (2008), which deal specifically with proliferation by Iran.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Financial Action Task Force has repeatedly called on members&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to advise financial institutions in their jurisdictions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with Iran, including Iranian companies and financial institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to apply effective countermeasures to protect their financial sectors from risks relating to money laundering and financing of terrorism that emanate from Iran;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to protect against correspondent relationships being used by Iran and Iranian companies and financial institutions to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk-mitigation practices; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to take into account risks relating to money laundering and financing of terrorism when considering requests by Iranian financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdictions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) At a February 2010 meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, the Task Force called on members to apply countermeasures &ldquo;to protect the international financial system from the ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks&rdquo; emanating from Iran.</p>
