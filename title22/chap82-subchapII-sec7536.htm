<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The President has declared his view that the United States should provide significant assistance to Afghanistan so that it is no longer a haven for terrorism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction assistance from the international community is necessary for the safe return of refugees and is critical to the future stability of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Enhanced stability in Afghanistan through an improved security environment is critical to the functioning of the Government of Afghanistan and the traditional Afghan assembly or &ldquo;Loya Jirga&rdquo; process, which is intended to lead to a permanent national government in Afghanistan, and also is essential for the participation of women in Afghan society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Incidents of violence between armed factions and local and regional commanders, and serious abuses of human rights, including attacks on women and ethnic minorities throughout Afghanistan, create an insecure, volatile, and unsafe environment in parts of Afghanistan, displacing thousands of Afghan civilians from their local communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) On July 6, Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir was assassinated in Kabul by unknown assailants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) On September 5, 2002, a car bomb exploded in Kabul killing 32 and injuring 150 and on the same day a member of Kandahar Governor Sherzai's security team attempted to assassinate President Karzai.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The violence and lawlessness may jeopardize the &ldquo;Loya Jirga&rdquo; process, undermine efforts to build a strong central government, severely impede reconstruction and the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and increase the likelihood that parts of Afghanistan will once again become safe havens for al-Qaida, Taliban forces, and drug traffickers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The lack of security and lawlessness may also perpetuate the need for United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan and threaten the ability of the United States to meet its military objectives.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1541 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, currently led by Turkey, and composed of forces from other willing countries without the participation of United States Armed Forces, is deployed only in Kabul and currently does not have the mandate or the capacity to provide security to other parts of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Due to the ongoing military campaign in Afghanistan, the United States does not contribute troops to the International Security Assistance Force but has provided support to other countries that are doing so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The United States is providing political, financial, training, and other assistance to the Afghan Interim Authority as it begins to build a national army and police force to help provide security throughout Afghanistan, but this effort is not meeting the immediate security needs of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Because of these immediate security needs, the Government of Afghanistan, its President, Hamid Karzai, and many Afghan regional leaders have called for the International Security Assistance Force, which has successfully brought stability to Kabul, to be expanded and deployed throughout the country, and this request has been strongly supported by a wide range of international humanitarian organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Catholic Relief Services, and Refugees International.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It should be the policy of the United States to support measures to help meet the immediate security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil order, and support the formation of a functioning, representative Afghan national government.</p>
