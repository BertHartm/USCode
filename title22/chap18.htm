<p class="statutory-body">(3) Dollars appropriated pursuant to this section shall be applied to the payment of interest and in satisfaction of notes issued or assumed hereunder, and to the extent of such application to the principal of the notes, the Director is authorized to issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury which will bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yields of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the guaranties. The currencies determined to be unavailable for, or in excess of, requirements of the United States as provided above shall be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury to be held until disposed of, and any dollar proceeds realized from such disposition shall be deposited in miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Section 1476(a) of this title shall not apply with respect to any amounts appropriated under this section for the purpose of liquidating the notes (and any accrued interest thereon) which were assumed in the operation of the informational media guaranty program under this section and which were outstanding on August 24, 1982.</p>

My reasons for proposing this plan are stated in another message transmitted to the Congress today.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:271 --><p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of officers specified in section 1 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">I expect that the improved organizational arrangement provided for in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 will lead to substantial economies and significantly improved effectiveness of administration. It is not practicable, however, to itemize at this time the reductions in expenditures which will probably be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the reorganization plan.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977 to consolidate certain international communication, educational and cultural, and broadcasting activities of the United States Government. I am acting under the authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act, chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. I am also acting pursuant to section 501 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;105), which provides that my recommendations for reorganizing these activities be transmitted by October 31, 1977.</p>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization will consolidate into a new agency, to be known as the Agency for International Communication, the functions now exercised by the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the United States Information Agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal aspects of this proposal are:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The new agency will take over USIA's international communications programs (including the Voice of America) and the international educational and cultural exchange activities now conducted by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The agency's Director will be the principal advisor on international information and exchange activities to the President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of State. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, the Director will have primary responsibility within the Government for the conduct of such activities. The Director, the Deputy Director and the Associate Directors of the new agency will be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The two commissions that now advise USIA and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs will be combined into a single seven-member commission. Members of this nonpartisan commission will be chosen from fields related to the agency's mission. The commissioners will be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of this reorganization is to broaden our informational, educational and cultural intercourse with the world, since this is the major means by which our government can inform others about our country, and inform ourselves about the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Agency for International Communication will play a central role in building these two-way bridges of understanding between our people and the other peoples of the world. Only by knowing and understanding each other's experiences can we find common ground on which we can examine and resolve our differences.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new agency will have two distinct but related goals:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">To tell the world about our society and policies&mdash;in particular our commitment to cultural diversity and individual liberty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">To tell ourselves about the world, so as to enrich our own culture as well as to give us the understanding to deal effectively with problems among nations.</p>
<p class="note-body">As the world becomes more and more interdependent, such mutual understanding becomes increasingly vital. The aim of this reorganization, therefore, is a more effective dialogue among peoples of the earth. Americans&mdash;mostly immigrants or the descendants of immigrants&mdash;are particularly well suited to enter into such an undertaking. We have already learned much from those who have brought differing values, perspectives and experiences to our shores. And we must continue to learn.</p>
<p class="note-body">Thus the new agency will lay heavy emphasis on listening to others, so as to learn something of their motivations and aspirations, their histories and cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several principles guided me in shaping this reorganization plan. Among the most important were:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Maintaining the integrity of the educational and cultural exchange programs is imperative. To this end, the plan retains the Board of Foreign Scholarships, whose strong leadership has done so much to insure the high quality of the educational exchange program. In addition, I intend to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of educational and cultural functions consolidated in the new Agency. The responsibilities presently exercised by the Department of State in relation to the Center for Technical and Cultural Interchange Between East and West, Inc., will be transferred to the new agency without alteration.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Keeping the Voice of America's news gathering and reporting functions independent and objective. The Voice's charter, enacted into law in 1976, provides that &ldquo;VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive&rdquo;; that VOA will &ldquo;present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions&rdquo;; and that VOA will present U.S. policies &ldquo;clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussion and opinion on these policies.&rdquo; Under this Administration, VOA will be solely responsible for the content of news broadcasts&mdash;for there is no more valued coin than candor in the international marketplace of ideas. I also plan to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of the Voice of America.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The new agency's activities must be straightforward, open, candid, balanced, and representative. They will not be given over to the advancement of the views of any one group, any one party or any one Administration. The agency must not operate in a covert, manipulative, or propagandistic way.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Rights of U.S. Information Agency and State Department employees must be respected. In the new agency, their career achievements will be recognized and the best possible use made of their professional skills and abilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the new agency will assess and advise on the impact on worldwide public opinion of American foreign policy decisions. The Agency will coordinate the international information, educational, cultural and exchange programs conducted by the U.S. Government and will be a governmental focal point for private <!-- PDFPage:274 -->U.S. international exchange programs. It will also play a leading role within the U.S. Government in our efforts to remove barriers to the international exchange of ideas and information.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies that will result from the proposed reorganization, and therefore I do not do so. The reorganization will result in greater efficiency by unifying in Washington the management of programs which are already administered in a consolidated manner in the field. For example, field officers will no longer report to two separate sets of supervisors and headquarters at home.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan abolishes the functions of the Advisory Committee on the Arts authorized by section 106(c) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2456(c)). Also abolished, as a result of the consolidation of certain functions of the United States Advisory Commission on Information and the United States Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs in the United States Advisory Commission on International Communication, Cultural and Educational Affairs, are the functions authorized by section 603 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1468) (requiring submission by the United States Advisory Commission on Information of a quarterly report to the Director of USIA and a semiannual report to the Congress). The new commission will report annually and at such other times as it deems appropriate (as does the existing Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs). Since appointments of all members of the new commission will be on a nonpartisan basis, as has been the case with the Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs, the requirement of section 602(a) of the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act (22 U.S.C. 1467(a)) that not more than three members of the Advisory Commission on Information shall be of the same political party is abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">Various obsolete or superseded functions under Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 (22 U.S.C. 1461 note), which created the USIA, are superseded by this plan. Finally, the Plan abolishes a provision authorizing the Secretary of State to pay the expenses of transporting the bodies of participants in exchange programs who die away from home, since State no longer will conduct such programs (22 U.S.C. 2670(e)). All functions abolished by the reorganization are done so in compliance with section 903(b) of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to carry out the policy set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. The provisions in this Plan for the appointment and pay of the Director, Deputy Director, and Associate Directors of the Agency have been found by me to be necessary by reason of the reorganization made by the plan and are at a rate applicable to comparable officers in the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">In presenting this plan, I ask the support of Congress to strengthen and simplify the machinery by which we carry out these important functions of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Such action will make us better able to project the great variety and vitality of American life to those abroad, and to enrich our own lives with a fuller knowledge of the vitality and variety of other societies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Agency for International Communication will help us demonstrate &ldquo;a decent respect for the opinions of mankind,&rdquo; and to deal intelligently with a world awakening to a new spirit of freedom.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The United States Information Agency shall prepare and submit to the Congress quarterly reports which contain a detailed explanation of expenditures for USIA&ndash;TV during the fiscal years 1990 and 1991. Such reports shall contain specific justification and supporting information pertaining to all programs, particularly those described in subsection (c)(4) of this section, that were produced in-house by USIA&ndash;TV. Each such report shall include a statement by the Director of the United States Information Agency that, according to the best information available to the United States Information Agency, no comparable United States commercially-produced or public television program is available at a cost which is equal to or less than the cost of production by USIA&ndash;TV.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is the policy of the United States to support the right of the people of Cuba to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers, in accordance with article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consonant with this policy, television broadcasting to Cuba may be effective in furthering the open communication of accurate information and ideas to the people of Cuba and, in particular, information about Cuba;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) television broadcasting to Cuba, operated in a manner not inconsistent with the broad foreign policy of the United States and in accordance with high professional standards, would be in the national interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilities broadcasting television programming to Cuba must be operated in a manner consistent with applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and must not affect the quality of domestic broadcast transmission or reception; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1465aa_1_target" name="1465aa_1">1</a></sup> the Voice of America already broadcasts to Cuba information that represents America, not any single segment of American society, and includes a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions, but that there is a need for television broadcasts to Cuba which provide news, commentary, and other information about events in Cuba and elsewhere to promote the cause of freedom in Cuba.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1465bb. Television broadcasting to Cuba</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Television broadcasting to Cuba</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the purposes set forth in section 1465aa of this title and notwithstanding the limitation of section 1461 of this title with respect to the dissemination in the United States of information prepared for dissemination abroad to the extent such dissemination is inadvertent, the United States Information Agency (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;) shall provide for the open communication of information and ideas through the use of television broadcasting to Cuba. Television broadcasting to Cuba shall serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of accurate, objective, and comprehensive news.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:282 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Voice of America standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Television broadcasting to Cuba under this subchapter shall be in accordance with all Voice of America standards to ensure the broadcast of programs which are objective, accurate, balanced, and which present a variety of views.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) USIA Television Marti</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any program of United States Government television broadcasts to Cuba authorized by this section shall be designated &ldquo;USIA Television Marti Program&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Frequency assignment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], the Federal Communications Commission shall assign by order a suitable frequency to further the national interests expressed in this subchapter, except that no such assignment shall result in objectionable interference with the broadcasts of any domestic licensee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No Federal branch or agency shall compel an incumbent domestic licensee to change its frequency in order to eliminate objectionable interference caused by broadcasting of the Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of section 305 of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 305], a television broadcast station established for purposes of this subchapter shall be treated as a government station, but the Federal Communications Commission shall exercise the authority of the President under such section to assign a frequency to such station.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Interference with domestic broadcasting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Broadcasting by the Television Marti Service shall be conducted in accordance with such parameters as shall be prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission to preclude objectionable interference with the broadcasts of any domestic licensee. The Television Marti Service shall be governed by the same standards regarding objectionable interference as any domestic licensee. The Federal Communications Commission shall monitor the operations of television broadcasting to Cuba pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. If, on the basis of such monitoring or a complaint from any person, the Federal Communications Commission determines, in its discretion, that broadcasting by the Television Marti Service is causing objectionable interference with the transmission or reception of the broadcasts of a domestic licensee, the Federal Communications Commission shall direct the Television Marti Service to cease broadcasting and to eliminate the objectionable interference. Broadcasts by the Service shall not be resumed until the Federal Communications Commission finds that the objectionable interference has been eliminated and should not recur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Federal Communications Commission shall take such actions as are necessary and appropriate to assist domestic licensees in overcoming the adverse effects of objectionable interference caused by broadcasting by the Television Marti Service. Such assistance may include the authorization of nondirectional increases in the effective radiated power of a domestic television station so that its coverage is equivalent to the maximum allowable for such facilities, to avoid any adverse effect on such stations of the broadcasts of the Television Marti Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Federal Communications Commission directs the Television Marti Service to cease broadcasting pursuant to paragraph (1), the Commission shall, as soon as practicable, notify the appropriate committees of Congress of such action and the reasons therefor. The Federal Communications Commission shall continue to notify the appropriate committees of Congress of progress in eliminating the objectionable interference and shall assure that Congress is fully informed about the operation of the Television Marti Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Monitoring of interference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Communications Commission shall continually monitor and periodically report to the appropriate committees of the Congress interference to domestic broadcast licensees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) from the operation of Cuban television and radio stations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) from the operations of the television broadcasting to Cuba.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Task force</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should establish a task force to analyze the level of interference from the operation of Cuban television and radio stations experienced by broadcasters in the United States and to seek a practical political and technical solution to this problem.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated for the United States Information Agency, in addition to amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated for the Agency, such sums as may be necessary for any fiscal year for increases in salary, pay, retirement, and other employee benefits authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appropriations authorization based on currency fluctuations; Buying Power Maintenance account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to maintain the levels of program activity provided for by the annual authorizing legislation for the United States Information Agency, there are authorized to be appropriated for the Agency such sums as may be necessary for any fiscal year to offset adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or overseas wage and price changes, occurring after November 30 of the earlier of (A) the calendar year which ended during the fiscal year preceding such fiscal year, or (B) the calendar year which preceded the calendar year during which the authorization of appropriations for such fiscal year was enacted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out this subsection, there may be established a Buying Power Maintenance account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In order to eliminate substantial gains to the approved levels of overseas operations for the United States Information Agency, the Director shall transfer to the Buying Power Maintenance account such amounts appropriated for &ldquo;Salaries and Expenses&rdquo; as the Director determines are excessive to the needs of the approved level of operations under that appropriation account because of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in overseas wages and prices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In order to offset adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or foreign wages and prices, the Director may transfer from the Buying Power Maintenance account to the &ldquo;Salaries and Expenses&rdquo; appropriations account such amounts as the Director determines are necessary to maintain the approved level of operations under that appropriation account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Funds transferred by the Director from the Buying Power Maintenance account to another account shall be merged with and be available for the same purpose, and for the same time period, as the funds in that other account. Funds transferred by the Director from another account to the Buying Power Maintenance account shall be merged with the funds in the Buying Power Maintenance account and shall be available for the purposes of that account until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any restriction contained in an appropriation Act or other provision of law limiting the amounts that may be obligated or expended by the United States Information Agency shall be deemed to be adjusted to the extent necessary to offset the net effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or overseas wage and price changes in order to maintain approved levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Subject to the limitations contained in this paragraph, not later than the end of the 5th fiscal year after the fiscal year for which funds are appropriated or otherwise made available for the &ldquo;Salaries and Expenses&rdquo; account, the Director may transfer any unobligated balance of such funds to the Buying Power Maintenance account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The balance of the Buying Power Maintenance account may not exceed $50,000,000 as a result of any transfer under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any transfer pursuant to this paragraph shall be treated as a reprogramming of funds under section 1477c of this title and shall be available for obligation or expenditure only in accordance with the procedures under such section.</p>
