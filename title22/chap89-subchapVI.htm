<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) United States support for democracy is strengthened by using a variety of different instrumentalities, such as the National Endowment for Democracy, the United States Agency for International Development, and the Department; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the purpose of the Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund should be to support innovative programming, media, and materials designed to uphold democratic principles, practices, and values, support and strengthen democratic institutions, promote human rights and the rule of law, and build civil societies in countries around the world.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress regarding mechanisms for delivering assistance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Democracy assistance has many different forms, including assistance to promote the rule of law, build the capacity of civil society, political parties, and legislatures, improve the independence of the media and the judiciary, enhance independent auditing functions, and advance security sector reform.</p>
