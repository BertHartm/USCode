<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) State Department policy concerning the advertising of security contracts at Foreign Service buildings has been inconsistent over the years. In many cases, diplomatic and consular posts abroad have been given the responsibility to determine the manner in which the private sector was notified concerning an invitation for bids or a request for proposals with respect to a local guard contract. Some United States foreign missions have only chosen to advertise locally the availability of a local security guard contract abroad.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) As a result, many United States security firms that provide local guard services abroad have been unaware that local guard contracts were available for bidding abroad and such firms have been disadvantaged as a result.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Undoubtedly, United States security firms would be interested in bidding on more <!-- PDFPage:1141 -->local guard contracts abroad if such firms knew of the opportunity to bid on such contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the objective of this section to improve the efficiency of the local guard programs abroad administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State and to ensure maximum competition for local guard contracts abroad concerning Foreign Service buildings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building which exceed $250,000 and are entered into after February 16, 1990, the Secretary of State shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish procedures to ensure that all solicitations for such contracts are adequately advertised in the Commerce and Business Daily;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) absent compelling reasons, award such contracts through the competitive process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in evaluating and scoring proposals for such contracts, award not less than 60 percent of the total points on the basis of technical factors and subfactors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in countries where contract denomination and/or payment in local currencies constitutes a barrier to competition by United States firms&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allow solicitations to be bid in United States dollars; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) allow contracts awarded to United States firms to be paid in United States dollars;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure that United States diplomatic and consular posts assist United States firms in obtaining local licenses and permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) establish procedures to ensure that appropriate measures are taken by diplomatic and consular post management to assure that United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons are not disadvantaged during the solicitation and bid evaluation process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) give preference to United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons where such persons are price competitive to the non-United States persons bidding on the contract, are properly licensed by the host government, and are otherwise qualified to carry out all the terms of the contract.</p>
