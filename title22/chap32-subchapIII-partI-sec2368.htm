<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;417, [div. A], title XVI, &sect;1602, Oct. 14, 2008, 122 Stat. 4653, as amended by Pub. L. 111&ndash;383, div. A, title X, &sect;1075(e)(18), Jan. 7, 2011, 124 Stat. 4375, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In June 2004, the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (referred to as the &lsquo;Coordinator&rsquo;) was established in the Department of State with the mandate to lead, coordinate, and institutionalize United States Government civilian capacity to prevent or prepare for post-conflict situations and help reconstruct and stabilize a country or region that is at risk of, in, or is in transition from, conflict or civil strife.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In December 2005, the Coordinator's mandate was reaffirmed by the National Security Presidential Directive 44, which instructed the Secretary of State, and at the Secretary's direction, the Coordinator, to coordinate and lead integrated United States Government efforts, involving all United States departments and agencies with relevant capabilities, to prepare, plan for, and conduct reconstruction and stabilization operations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) National Security Presidential Directive 44 assigns to the Secretary, with the Coordinator's assistance, the lead role to develop reconstruction and stabilization strategies, ensure civilian interagency program and policy coordination, coordinate interagency processes to identify countries at risk of instability, provide decision-makers with detailed options for an integrated United States Government response in connection with reconstruction and stabilization operations, and carry out a wide range of other actions, including the development of a civilian surge capacity to meet reconstruction and stabilization emergencies. The Secretary and the Coordinator are also charged with coordinating with the Department of Defense on reconstruction and stabilization responses, and integrating planning and implementing procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Department of Defense issued Directive 3000.05, which establishes that stability operations are a core United States military mission that the Department of Defense must be prepared to conduct and support, provides guidance on stability operations that will evolve over time, and assigns responsibilities within the Department of Defense for planning, training, and preparing to conduct and support stability operations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The President's Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Request to Congress includes $248.6 million for a Civilian Stabilization Initiative that would vastly improve civilian partnership with United States Armed Forces in post-conflict stabilization situations, including by establishing an Active Response Corps of 250 persons, a Standby Response Corps of 2,000 persons, and a Civilian Response Corps of 2,000 persons.&rdquo;</p>
