The tolls on vessels in ballast without passengers or cargo may be less than the tolls for vessels with passengers or cargo. Tolls for small vessels (including yachts), as defined by the Commission, may be set at rates determined by the Commission without regard to the preceding provisions of this subsection.</p>

Tolls shall not be prescribed at rates calculated to produce revenues sufficient to cover payments to the Republic of Panama pursuant to paragraph 4(c) of Article XIII of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment of tolls by vessels of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Vessels operated by the United States, including vessels of war and auxiliary vessels, and ocean-going training ships owned by the United States and operated by State nautical schools, shall pay tolls.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Levy of tolls</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The levy of tolls is subject to the provisions of section 1 of Article III of the treaty between the United States of America and Great Britain signed November 18, 1901, of Article I of the treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Colombia signed April 6, 1914, and of Articles II, III, and VI of the Treaty Concerning Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama, signed September 7, 1977.</p>
