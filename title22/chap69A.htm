<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6021. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of at least 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the end of its subsidization by the former Soviet Union of between 5 billion and 6 billion dollars annually;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 36 years of communist tyranny and economic mismanagement by the Castro government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the extreme decline in trade between Cuba and the countries of the former Soviet bloc; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the stated policy of the Russian Government and the countries of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with Cuba on strictly commercial terms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban people have substantially deteriorated as a result of this economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime to permit free and fair democratic elections in Cuba.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Castro regime has made it abundantly clear that it will not engage in any substantive political reforms that would lead to democracy, a market economy, or an economic recovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on free and fair democratic elections, and continuing violations of fundamental human rights, have isolated the Cuban regime as the only completely nondemocratic government in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) As long as free elections are not held in Cuba, the economic condition of the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not improve in any significant way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to risk or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from Cuba to freedom.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Radio Marti and Television Marti have both been effective vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news and information and have helped to bolster the morale of the people of Cuba living under tyranny.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The consistent policy of the United States towards Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in sanctioning the totalitarian Castro regime.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The United States has shown a deep commitment, and considers it a moral obligation, to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms as expressed in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The Congress has historically and consistently manifested its solidarity and the solidarity of the American people with the democratic aspirations of the Cuban people.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1232 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 [22 U.S.C. 6001 et seq.] calls upon the President to encourage the governments of countries that conduct trade with Cuba to restrict their trade and credit relations with Cuba in a manner consistent with the purposes of that Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.] made by the FREEDOM Support Act require that the President, in providing economic assistance to Russia and the emerging Eurasian democracies, take into account the extent to which they are acting to &ldquo;terminate support for the communist regime in Cuba, including removal of troops, closing military facilities, and ceasing trade subsidies and economic, nuclear, and other assistance&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) The Cuban Government engages in the illegal international narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from justice in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) The Castro government threatens international peace and security by engaging in acts of armed subversion and terrorism such as the training and supplying of groups dedicated to international violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The Castro government has utilized from its inception and continues to utilize torture in various forms (including by psychiatry), as well as execution, exile, confiscation, political imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression, as means of retaining power.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as &ldquo;pluralistic garbage&rdquo; and continues to make clear that he has no intention of tolerating the democratization of Cuban society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) The Castro government holds innocent Cubans hostage in Cuba by no fault of the hostages themselves solely because relatives have escaped the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) Although a signatory state to the 1928 Inter-American Convention on Asylum and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which protects the right to leave one's own country), Cuba nevertheless surrounds embassies in its capital by armed forces to thwart the right of its citizens to seek asylum and systematically denies that right to the Cuban people, punishing them by imprisonment for seeking to leave the country and killing them for attempting to do so (as demonstrated in the case of the confirmed murder of over 40 men, women, and children who were seeking to leave Cuba on July 13, 1994).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) The Castro government continues to utilize blackmail, such as the immigration crisis with which it threatened the United States in the summer of 1994, and other unacceptable and illegal forms of conduct to influence the actions of sovereign states in the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Charter of the Organization of American States and other international agreements and international law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly reported on the unacceptable human rights situation in Cuba and has taken the extraordinary step of appointing a Special Rapporteur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) The Cuban Government has consistently refused access to the Special Rapporteur and formally expressed its decision not to &ldquo;implement so much as one comma&rdquo; of the United Nations Resolutions appointing the Rapporteur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(22) The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 47&ndash;139 on December 18, 1992, Resolution 48&ndash;142 on December 20, 1993, and Resolution 49&ndash;200 on December 23, 1994, referencing the Special Rapporteur's reports to the United Nations and condemning violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(23) Article 39 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter provides that the United Nations Security Council &ldquo;shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken .&nbsp;.&nbsp;., to maintain or restore international peace and security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(24) The United Nations has determined that massive and systematic violations of human rights may constitute a &ldquo;threat to peace&rdquo; under Article 39 and has imposed sanctions due to such violations of human rights in the cases of Rhodesia, South Africa, Iraq, and the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(25) In the case of Haiti, a neighbor of Cuba not as close to the United States as Cuba, the United States led an effort to obtain and did obtain a United Nations Security Council embargo and blockade against that country due to the existence of a military dictatorship in power less than 3 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(26) United Nations Security Council Resolution 940 of July 31, 1994, subsequently authorized the use of &ldquo;all necessary means&rdquo; to restore the &ldquo;democratically elected government of Haiti&rdquo;, and the democratically elected government of Haiti was restored to power on October 15, 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(27) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive manner to end the tyranny that has oppressed them for 36 years, and the continued failure to do so constitutes ethically improper conduct by the international community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(28) For the past 36 years, the Cuban Government has posed and continues to pose a national security threat to the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the President should advocate, and should instruct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to propose and seek within the Security Council, a mandatory international embargo against the totalitarian Cuban Government pursuant to chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, employing efforts similar to consultations conducted by United States representatives with respect to Haiti;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any resumption of efforts by any independent state of the former Soviet Union to make operational any nuclear facilities in Cuba, and any continuation of intelligence activities by such a state from Cuba that are targeted at the United States and its citizens will have a detrimental impact on United States assistance to such state; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) President Clinton stated in April 1993 that the United States opposed the construction of the Juragua nuclear power plant because of the concerns of the United States about Cuba's ability to ensure the safe operation of the facility and because of Cuba's refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or ratify the Treaty of Tlatelolco.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Cuba has not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the latter of which establishes Latin America and the Caribbean as a nuclear weapons-free zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The State Department, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy have expressed concerns about the construction and operation of Cuba's nuclear reactors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In a September 1992 report to the Congress, the General Accounting Office outlined concerns among nuclear energy experts about deficiencies in the nuclear plant project in Juragua, near Cienfuegos, Cuba, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a lack in Cuba of a nuclear regulatory structure;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1239 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the absence in Cuba of an adequate infrastructure to ensure the plant's safe operation and requisite maintenance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the inadequacy of training of plant operators;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) reports by a former technician from Cuba who, by examining with x-rays weld sites believed to be part of the auxiliary plumbing system for the plant, found that 10 to 15 percent of those sites were defective;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) since September 5, 1992, when construction on the plant was halted, the prolonged exposure to the elements, including corrosive salt water vapor, of the primary reactor components; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the possible inadequacy of the upper portion of the reactors&rsquo; dome retention capability to withstand only 7 pounds of pressure per square inch, given that normal atmospheric pressure is 32 pounds per square inch and United States reactors are designed to accommodate pressures of 50 pounds per square inch.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The United States Geological Survey claims that it had difficulty determining answers to specific questions regarding earthquake activity in the area near Cienfuegos because the Cuban Government was not forthcoming with information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Geological Survey has indicated that the Caribbean plate, a geological formation near the south coast of Cuba, may pose seismic risks to Cuba and the site of the power plant, and may produce large to moderate earthquakes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) On May 25, 1992, the Caribbean plate produced an earthquake numbering 7.0 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) According to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, summer winds could carry radioactive pollutants from a nuclear accident at the power plant throughout all of Florida and parts of the States on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico as far as Texas, and northern winds could carry the pollutants as far northeast as Virginia and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Cuban Government, under dictator Fidel Castro, in 1962 advocated the Soviets&rsquo; launching of nuclear missiles to the United States, which represented a direct and dangerous provocation of the United States and brought the world to the brink of a nuclear conflict.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Fidel Castro over the years has consistently issued threats against the United States Government, most recently that he would unleash another perilous mass migration from Cuba upon the enactment of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Despite the various concerns about the plant's safety and operational problems, a feasibility study is being conducted that would establish a support group to include Russia, Cuba, and third countries with the objective of completing and operating the plant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Withholding of foreign assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President shall withhold from assistance allocated, on or after March 12, 1996, for any country an amount equal to the sum of assistance and credits, if any, provided on or after March 12, 1996, by that country or any entity in that country in support of the completion of the Cuban nuclear facility at Juragua, near Cienfuegos, Cuba.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement of paragraph (1) to withhold assistance shall not apply with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assistance to meet urgent humanitarian needs, including disaster and refugee relief;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) democratic political reform or rule of law activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the creation of private sector or nongovernmental organizations that are independent of government control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the development of a free market economic system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) assistance for the purposes described in the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 (title XII of Public Law 103&ndash;160) [22 U.S.C. 5951 et seq.]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) assistance under the secondary school exchange program administered by the United States Information Agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Assistance&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; means assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], credits, sales, guarantees of extensions of credit, and other assistance under the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.], assistance under titles I and III of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., 1727 et seq.], assistance under the FREEDOM Support Act, and any other program of assistance or credits provided by the United States to other countries under other provisions of law.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6046. Condemnation of Cuban attack on American aircraft</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Brothers to the Rescue is a Miami-based humanitarian organization engaged in searching for and aiding Cuban refugees in the Straits of Florida, and was engaged in such a mission on Saturday, February 24, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The members of Brothers to the Rescue were flying unarmed and defenseless planes in a mission identical to hundreds they have flown since 1991 and posed no threat whatsoever to the Cuban Government, the Cuban military, or the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Statements by the Cuban Government that Brothers to the Rescue has engaged in covert operations, bombing campaigns, and commando operations against the Government of Cuba have no basis in fact.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1241 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Brothers to the Rescue aircraft notified air traffic controllers as to their flight plans, which would take them south of the 24th parallel and close to Cuban airspace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) International law provides a nation with airspace over the 12-mile territorial sea.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The response of Fidel Castro's dictatorship to Saturday's afternoon flight was to scramble 2 fighter jets from a Havana airfield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) At approximately 3:24 p.m., the pilot of one of the Cuban MiGs received permission and proceeded to shoot down one Brothers to the Rescue airplane more than 6 miles north of the Cuban exclusion zone, or 18 miles from the Cuban coast.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Approximately 7 minutes later, the pilot of the Cuban fighter jet received permission and proceeded to shoot down the second Brothers to the Rescue airplane almost 18.5 miles north of the Cuban exclusion zone, or 30.5 miles from the Cuban coast.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Cuban dictatorship, if it truly felt threatened by the flight of these unarmed aircraft, could have and should have pursued other peaceful options as required by international law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The response chosen by Fidel Castro, the use of lethal force, was completely inappropriate to the situation presented to the Cuban Government, making such actions a blatant and barbaric violation of international law and tantamount to cold-blooded murder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) There were no survivors of the attack on these aircraft, and the crew of a third aircraft managed to escape this criminal attack by Castro's Air Force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The crew members of the destroyed planes, Pablo Morales, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Armando Alejandre, were United States citizens from Miami flying with Brothers to the Rescue on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) It is incumbent upon the United States Government to protect the lives and livelihoods of United States citizens as well as the rights of free passage and humanitarian missions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) This premeditated act took place after a week-long wave of repression by the Cuban Government against Concilio Cubano, an umbrella organization of human rights activists, dissidents, independent economists, and independent journalists, among others.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The wave of repression against Concilio Cubano, whose membership is committed to peaceful democratic change in Cuba, included arrests, strip searches, house arrests, and in some cases sentences to more than 1 year in jail.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statements by Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress strongly condemns the act of terrorism by the Castro regime in shooting down the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft on February 24, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress extends its condolences to the families of Pablo Morales, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Armando Alejandre, the victims of the attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress urges the President to seek, in the International Court of Justice, indictment for this act of terrorism by Fidel Castro.</p>

<!-- field-start:head -->
<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6081. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Individuals enjoy a fundamental right to own and enjoy property which is enshrined in the United States Constitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The wrongful confiscation or taking of property belonging to United States nationals by the Cuban Government, and the subsequent exploitation of this property at the expense of the rightful owner, undermines the comity of nations, the free flow of commerce, and economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba in 1959&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) he has trampled on the fundamental rights of the Cuban people; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1247 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) through his personal despotism, he has confiscated the property of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) millions of his own citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) thousands of United States nationals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) thousands more Cubans who claimed asylum in the United States as refugees because of persecution and later became naturalized citizens of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is in the interest of the Cuban people that the Cuban Government respect equally the property rights of Cuban nationals and nationals of other countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Cuban Government is offering foreign investors the opportunity to purchase an equity interest in, manage, or enter into joint ventures using property and assets some of which were confiscated from United States nationals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) This &ldquo;trafficking&rdquo; in confiscated property provides badly needed financial benefit, including hard currency, oil, and productive investment and expertise, to the current Cuban Government and thus undermines the foreign policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to bring democratic institutions to Cuba through the pressure of a general economic embargo at a time when the Castro regime has proven to be vulnerable to international economic pressure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to protect the claims of United States nationals who had property wrongfully confiscated by the Cuban Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The United States Department of State has notified other governments that the transfer to third parties of properties confiscated by the Cuban Government &ldquo;would complicate any attempt to return them to their original owners&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The international judicial system, as currently structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) International law recognizes that a nation has the ability to provide for rules of law with respect to conduct outside its territory that has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The United States Government has an obligation to its citizens to provide protection against wrongful confiscations by foreign nations and their citizens, including the provision of private remedies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) To deter trafficking in wrongfully confiscated property, United States nationals who were the victims of these confiscations should be endowed with a judicial remedy in the courts of the United States that would deny traffickers any profits from economically exploiting Castro's wrongful seizures.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6082. Liability for trafficking in confiscated property claimed by United States nationals</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Civil remedy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Liability for trafficking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person that, after the end of the 3-month period beginning on the effective date of this subchapter, traffics in property which was confiscated by the Cuban Government on or after January 1, 1959, shall be liable to any United States national who owns the claim to such property for money damages in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount which is the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the amount, if any, certified to the claimant by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.], plus interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the amount determined under section 6083(a)(2) of this title, plus interest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the fair market value of that property, calculated as being either the current value of the property, or the value of the property when confiscated plus interest, whichever is greater; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) court costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Interest under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be at the rate set forth in section 1961 of title 28, computed by the court from the date of confiscation of the property involved to the date on which the action is brought under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Presumption in favor of the certified claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be a presumption that the amount for which a person is liable under clause (i) of paragraph (1)(A) is the amount that is certified as described in subclause (I) of that clause. The presumption shall be rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence that the amount described in subclause (II) or (III) of that clause is the appropriate amount of liability under that clause.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Increased liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any person that traffics in confiscated property for which liability is incurred under paragraph (1) shall, if a United States national owns a claim with respect to that property which was certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1643 et seq.], be liable for damages computed in accordance with subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the claimant in an action under this subsection (other than a United States national to whom subparagraph (A) applies) provides, after the end of the 3-month period described in paragraph (1) notice to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a person against whom the action is to be initiated, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a person who is to be joined as a defendant in the action,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">at least 30 days before initiating the action or joining such person as a defendant, as the case may be, and that person, after the end of the <!-- PDFPage:1248 -->30-day period beginning on the date the notice is provided, traffics in the confiscated property that is the subject of the action, then that person shall be liable to that claimant for damages computed in accordance with subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Damages for which a person is liable under subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) are money damages in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 3 times the amount determined applicable under paragraph (1)(A)(i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notice to a person under subparagraph (B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall be in writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall be posted by certified mail or personally delivered to the person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) a statement of intention to commence the action under this section or to join the person as a defendant (as the case may be), together with the reasons therefor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a demand that the unlawful trafficking in the claimant's property cease immediately; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a copy of the summary statement published under paragraph (8).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, actions may be brought under paragraph (1) with respect to property confiscated before, on, or after March 12, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of property confiscated before March 12, 1996, a United States national may not bring an action under this section on a claim to the confiscated property unless such national acquires ownership of the claim before March 12, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In the case of property confiscated on or after March 12, 1996, a United States national who, after the property is confiscated, acquires ownership of a claim to the property by assignment for value, may not bring an action on the claim under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of certain actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of a United States national who was eligible to file a claim with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1643 et seq.] but did not so file the claim, that United States national may not bring an action on that claim under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of any action brought under this section by a United States national whose underlying claim in the action was timely filed with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 but was denied by the Commission, the court shall accept the findings of the Commission on the claim as conclusive in the action under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A United States national, other than a United States national bringing an action under this section on a claim certified under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, may not bring an action on a claim under this section before the end of the 2-year period beginning on March 12, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) An interest in property for which a United States national has a claim certified under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 may not be the subject of a claim in an action under this section by any other person. Any person bringing an action under this section whose claim has not been so certified shall have the burden of establishing for the court that the interest in property that is the subject of the claim is not the subject of a claim so certified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Inapplicability of act of state doctrine</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No court of the United States shall decline, based upon the act of state doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action brought under paragraph (1) .</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Licenses not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action under this section may be brought and may be settled, and a judgment rendered in such action may be enforced, without obtaining any license or other permission from any agency of the United States, except that this paragraph shall not apply to the execution of a judgment against, or the settlement of actions involving, property blocked under the authorities of section 5(b) of title 50, Appendix, that were being exercised on July 1, 1977, as a result of a national emergency declared by the President before such date, and are being exercised on March 12, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and for purposes of this subchapter only, any claim against the Cuban Government shall not be deemed to be an interest in property the transfer of which to a United States national required before March 12, 1996, or requires after March 12, 1996, a license issued by, or the permission of, any agency of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Publication by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 60 days after March 12, 1996, the Attorney General shall prepare and publish in the Federal Register a concise summary of the provisions of this subchapter, including a statement of the liability under this subchapter of a person trafficking in confiscated property, and the remedies available to United States nationals under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount in controversy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An action may be brought under this section by a United States national only where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $50,000, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. In calculating $50,000 for purposes of the preceding sentence, the applicable amount under subclause (I), (II), or (III) of subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) of this section may not be tripled as provided in subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedural requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in this subchapter, the provisions of title 28 and the rules of the <!-- PDFPage:1249 -->courts of the United States apply to actions under this section to the same extent as such provisions and rules apply to any other action brought under section 1331 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any person who brings, under the common law or any provision of law other than this section, a civil action or proceeding for monetary or nonmonetary compensation arising out of a claim for which an action would otherwise be cognizable under this section may not bring an action under this section on that claim.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
