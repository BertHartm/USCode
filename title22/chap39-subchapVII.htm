<p class="statutory-body">Sanctions set forth in subsection (a) of this section may not be imposed under this section on a person with respect to acts described in such subsection or, if such sanctions are in effect against a person on account of such acts, such sanctions shall be terminated, if an MTCR adherent is taking judicial or other enforcement action against that person with respect to such acts, or that person has been found by the government of an MTCR adherent to be innocent of wrongdoing with respect to such acts, and if the President certifies to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver and report to Congress</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event that the President decides to apply the waiver described in paragraph (1), the President shall so notify the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives not less than 45 working days before issuing the waiver. Such notification shall include a report fully articulating the rationale and circumstances which led the President to apply the waiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether to apply sanctions under subsection (a) of this section to a foreign person involved in the export, transfer, or trade <!-- PDFPage:1059 -->of an item on the MTCR Annex, it should be a rebuttable presumption that such item is designed for use in a missile listed in the MTCR Annex if the President determines that the final destination of the item is a country the government of which the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of 2405(j)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2797b_2_target" name="2797b_2">2</a></sup> of title 50, Appendix, has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under paragraph (1) on a person with respect to a product or service if the President certifies to the Congress that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such person is a sole source supplier of the product or service, the product or service is not available from any alternative reliable supplier, and the need for the product or service cannot be met in a timely manner by improved manufacturing processes or technological developments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including the exercise of options for production quantities to satisfy requirements essential to the national security of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the President determines that the person to which the sanctions would be applied is a sole source supplier of the defense articles and services, that the defense articles or services are essential to the national security of the United States, and that alternative sources are not readily or reasonably available; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the President determines that such articles or services are essential to the national security of the United States under defense coproduction agreements or NATO Programs of Cooperation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to products or services provided under contracts entered into before the date on which the President publishes his intention to impose the sanctions; or</p>
