<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Interim assistance to United States broadcasters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intent of the Congress that the Secretary of State should seek prompt and full settlement of United States claims against the Government of Cuba arising from Cuban interference with broadcasting in the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the Agency may make payments to the United States radio broadcasting station licensees upon their application for expenses which they have incurred before, on, or after October 4, 1983, in mitigating, pursuant to special temporary authority from the Federal Communications Commission, the effects of activities by the Government of Cuba which directly interfere with the transmission or reception of broadcasts by these licensees. Such expenses shall be limited to the costs of equipment replaced (less depreciation) and associated technical and engineering costs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Presidential task force</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should establish a task force to analyze the level of interference from the operation of <!-- PDFPage:281 -->Cuban radio stations experienced by broadcasters in the United States and to seek a practical political and technical solution to this problem.</p>
