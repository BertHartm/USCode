<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">An ultimate goal of the United States is a world which is free from the scourge of war and the dangers and burdens of armaments; in which the use of force has been subordinated to the rule of law; and in which international adjustments to a changing world are achieved peacefully. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide impetus toward this goal by creating a new agency of peace to deal with the problem of reduction and control of armaments looking toward ultimate world disarmament.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy, being an important aspect of foreign policy, must be consistent with national security policy as a whole. The formulation and implementation of United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy in a manner which will promote the national security can best be insured by a central organization charged by statute with primary responsibility for this field. This organization must have such a position within the Government that it can provide the President, the Secretary of State, other officials of the executive branch, and the Congress with recommendations concerning United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy, and can assess the effect of these recommendations upon our foreign policies, our national security policies, and our economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">This organization must have the capacity to provide the essential scientific, economic, political, military, psychological, and technological information upon which realistic arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy must be based. It shall have the authority, under the direction of the President and the Secretary of State, to carry out the following primary functions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The preparation for and management of United States participation in international negotiations and implementation fora in the arms control and disarmament field.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) When directed by the President, the preparation for, and management of, United States participation in international negotiations and implementation fora in the nonproliferation field.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:726 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The conduct, support, and coordination of research for arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy formulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The preparation for, operation of, or, as appropriate, direction of, United States participation in such control systems as may become part of United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The dissemination and coordination of public information concerning arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of security and loyalty requirements, restrictions, and safeguards; investigation of personnel; standards of clearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall establish such security and loyalty requirements, restrictions, and safeguards as he deems necessary in the interest of the national security and to carry out the provisions of this chapter. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Director shall arrange with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management for the conduct of full-field background security and loyalty investigations of all the Agency's officers, employees, consultants, persons detailed from other Government agencies, members of its General Advisory Committee, advisory boards, contractors, and subcontractors, and their officers and employees, actual or prospective. In the case of persons detailed from other Government agencies or employed directly from other Government agencies, the Director may accept the results of full-field background security and loyalty investigations conducted by such agencies as the basis for the determination required by this subsection that the person is not a security risk or of doubtful loyalty. In the event the investigation discloses information indicating that the person investigated may be or may become a security risk, or may be of doubtful loyalty, the report of the investigation shall be turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a full-field investigation. The final results of all such investigations shall be turned over to the Director for final determination. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, no person shall be permitted to enter on duty as such an officer, employee, consultant, or member of advisory committee or board, or pursuant to any such detail, and no contractor or subcontractor, or officer or employee thereof shall be permitted to have access to any classified information, until he shall have been investigated in accordance with this subsection and the report of such investigations made to the Director, and the Director shall have determined that such person is not a security risk or of doubtful loyalty. Standards applicable with respect to the security clearance of persons within any category re<!-- PDFPage:739 -->ferred to in this subsection shall not be less stringent, and the investigation of such persons for such purposes shall not be less intensive or complete, than in the case of such clearance of persons in a corresponding category under the security procedures of the Government agency or agencies having the highest security restrictions with respect to persons in such category.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acceptance of investigation and clearance granted by other Government agencies to contractor personnel; access to confidential information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of contractors or subcontractors and their officers or employees, actual or prospective, the Director may accept, in lieu of the investigation prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, a report of investigation conducted by a Government agency, other than the Director of the Office of Personnel Management or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, when it is determined by the Director that the completed investigation meets the standards established in subsection (a) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That security clearance had been granted to the individual concerned by another Government agency based upon such investigation and report. The Director may also grant access for information classified no higher than &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; to contractors or subcontractors and their officers and employees, actual or prospective, on the basis of reports on less than full-field investigations: <em>Provided</em>, That such investigations shall each include a current national agency check. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Director may also grant access to classified information to contractors or subcontractors and their officers and employees, actual or prospective, on the basis of a security clearance granted by the Department of Defense, or any agency thereof, to the individual concerned; except that any access to Restricted Data shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Atomic Energy Commission Restricted Data; access; personnel security procedures and standards of Commission and Agency; interim clearance; exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Atomic Energy Commission may authorize any of its employees, or employees of any contractor, prospective contractor, licensee, or prospective licensee of the Atomic Energy Commission or any other person authorized to have access to Restricted Data by the Atomic Energy Commission under section 2165 of title 42, to permit the Director or any officer, employee, consultant, person detailed from other Government agencies, member of the General Advisory Committee or of an advisory board established pursuant to section 2581(f) of this title, contractor, subcontractor, prospective contractor, or prospective subcontractor, or officer or employee of such contractor, subcontractor, prospective contractor, or prospective subcontractor, to have access to Restricted Data which is required in the performance of his duties and so certified by the Director, but only if (1) the Atomic Energy Commission has determined, in accordance with the established personnel security procedures and standards of the Commission, that permitting such individual to have access to such Restricted Data will not endanger the common defense and security, and (2) the Atomic Energy Commission finds that the established personnel and other security procedures and standards of the Agency are adequate and in reasonable conformity to the standards established by the Atomic Energy Commission under section 2165 of title 42, including those for interim clearance in subsection (b) thereof. Any individual granted access to such Restricted Data pursuant to this subsection may exchange such data with any individual who (A) is an officer or employee of the Department of Defense, or any department or agency thereof, or a member of the Armed Forces, or an officer or employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or a contractor or subcontractor of any such department, agency, or armed force, or an officer or employee of any such contractor or subcontractor, and (B) has been authorized to have access to Restricted Data under the provisions of sections 2163 or 2455 of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of required investigation and determination with respect to consultants; procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The investigations and determination required under subsection (a) of this section may be waived by the Director in the case of any consultant who will not be permitted to have access to classified information if the Director determines and certifies in writing that such waiver is in the best interests of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">United States Program for On-Site Inspections Under Arms Control Agreements</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 101&ndash;189, div. A, title X, &sect;1014, Nov. 29, 1989, 103 Stat. 1547, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings Concerning On-Site Inspection Personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The United States is currently engaged in multilateral and bilateral negotiations seeking to achieve treaties or agreements to reduce or eliminate various types of military weapons and to make certain reductions in military personnel levels. These negotiations include negotiations for (A) reductions in strategic forces, conventional armaments, and military personnel levels, (B) regimes for monitoring nuclear testing, and (C) the complete elimination of chemical weapons.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Requirements for monitoring these possible treaties or agreements will be extensive and will place severe stress on the monitoring capabilities of United States national technical means.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the case of the INF Treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union negotiated, and are currently using, on-site inspection procedures to complement and support monitoring by national technical means. Similar on-site inspection procedures are being negotiated for inclusion in possible future treaties and agreements referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) During initial implementation of the provisions of the INF Treaty, the United States was not fully prepared for the personnel requirements for the conduct of on-site inspections. The Director of Central Intelligence has stated that on-site inspection requirements for any strategic arms reduction treaty or agreement will be far more extensive than those for the INF Treaty. The number of locations within the Soviet Union that would possibly be subject to on-site inspections under a START agreement have been estimated to be approximately 2,500 (compared to 120 for the INF Treaty).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) On-site inspection procedures are likely to be an integral part of any future arms control treaty or agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Personnel requirements will be extensive for such on-site inspection procedures, both in terms of numbers of personnel and technical and linguistic skills. Since verification requirements for the INF Treaty are already placing severe stress on current personnel resources, the requirements for verification under START and other possible future treaties and agreements may quickly exceed the current number of verification personnel having necessary technical and language skills.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is a clear need for a database of the names of individuals who are members of the Armed Forces or civilian employees of the United States Government, or of other citizens and nationals of the United States, who are qualified (by reason of technical or language skills) to participate in on-site inspections under an arms control treaty or agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The organization best suited to establish such a database is the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA) of the Department of Defense, which was created by the President to implement (for the United States) the on-site inspection provisions of the INF Treaty.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Status of the OSIA</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) the Director of the OSIA (currently a brigadier general of the Army) is appointed by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the approval of the President;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) the Secretary of Defense provides to the Director appropriate policy guidance formulated by the interagency arms control mechanism established by the President;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) most of the personnel of the OSIA are members of the Armed Forces (who are trained and paid by the military departments within the Department of Defense) and include linguists, weapons specialists, and foreign area specialists;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) the Department of Defense provides the OSIA with substantially all of its administrative and logistic support (including military air transportation for inspections in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(E) the facilities in Europe and the United States at which OSIA personnel escort personnel of the Soviet Union conducting inspections under the on-site inspection terms of the INF Treaty are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense (or under the jurisdiction of entities that are contractors with the Department of Defense).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) In light of the findings in paragraph (1) and the report submitted pursuant to section 909 of Public Law 100&ndash;456 [div. A, title IX, Sept. 29, 1988, 102 Stat. 2036] entitled &lsquo;Report to the Congress on U.S. Monitoring and Verification Activities Related to the INF Treaty&rsquo; (submitted on July 27, 1989), Congress hereby determines that by locating the On-Site Inspection Agency within the Department of Defense for the purposes of administrative and logistic support and operational guidance, and integrating on-site inspection responsibilities under the INF Treaty with existing organizational activities of that Department, the President has been able to ensure that sensitive national security assets are protected and that obligations of the United States under that treaty are fulfilled in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Personnel Database</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In light of the findings in subsection (a), the Director of the On-Site Inspection Agency shall establish a database consisting of the names of individuals who could be assigned or detailed (in the case of Government personnel) or employed (in the case of non-Government personnel) to participate in the conduct of on-site inspections under any future arms control treaty or agreement that includes provisions for such inspections.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The database should be composed of the names of individuals with skills (including linguistic and technical skills) necessary for the conduct of on-site inspections.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>INF Treaty Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, the term &lsquo;INF Treaty&rsquo; means the Treaty Between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed in Washington, DC, on December 8, 1987.&rdquo;</p>
