<p class="statutory-body">(B) The period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the period which begins on the first day of the month following the month in which the divorce or annulment becomes final and ends on the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 55 years of age.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A former spouse shall not be qualified for any benefit under this subsection if, before the commencement of any benefit, the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of title 26, payments to a former spouse under this section shall be treated as income to the former spouse and not to the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any reduction in payments to a participant or former participant as a result of payments to a former spouse under this subsection shall be disregarded in calculating&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this part, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under this part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the annuity of the former spouse shall commence on the date the participant would qualify, on the basis of his or her creditable service, for an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) or the date the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any former spouse who becomes entitled to receive any benefit under this part which would otherwise be payable to a participant or former participant shall be entitled to make any election regarding method of payment to such former spouse that such participant would have otherwise been entitled to elect, and the participant may elect an alternate method for the remaining share of such benefits.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A former spouse may not elect a method of payment under subchapter II, chapter 84 of title 5, providing for payment of a survivor annuity to any survivor of the former spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The maximum amount payable to any former spouse pursuant to this subsection shall be the difference, if any, between 50 percent of the total benefits authorized to be paid to a former participant by this part, disregarding any apportionment of these benefits to others, and the aggregate amount payable to all others at any one time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Entitlement to survivor benefits; determination of share; disqualification upon remarriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Unless otherwise expressly provided for by any spousal agreement or court order governing survivorship benefits under this part to a former spouse married to a participant or former participant for the periods specified in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, such former spouse is <!-- PDFPage:1104 -->entitled to a share, determined under subsection (b)(2) of this section, of all survivor benefits that would otherwise be payable under this part to an eligible surviving spouse of the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The share referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section equals&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of participant from Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System; determination of benefit share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a member becomes a participant under this part after qualifying for benefits under part I of this subchapter and, at the time of transfer, has a former spouse entitled to benefits under part I of this subchapter which are determined under section 4054 or 4055 of this title (as determined by the Secretary of State) and are similar in amount to a pro rata share division under section 4054 or 4055 of this title and the service of the member as a participant under this part is not recognized in determining that pro rata share, then subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply to such former spouse. Otherwise, subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Death of participant entitled to deferred annuity; spousal agreement; payment of survivor annuity</h4>
