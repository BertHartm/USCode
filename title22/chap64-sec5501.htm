<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the safety and security of passengers of United States air carriers against terrorist threats should be given the highest priority by the United States Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the report of the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, dated May 15, 1990, found that current aviation security systems are inadequate to provide such protection;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States Government should immediately take steps to ensure fuller compliance with existing laws and regulations relating to aviation security;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the United States Government should work through the International Civil Aviation Organization and directly with foreign governments to enhance aviation security of foreign carriers and at foreign airports;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the United States Government, in bilateral negotiations with foreign governments, should emphasize upgrading international aviation security objectives;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the United States should work with other nations to treat as outlaws state sponsors of terrorism, isolating such sponsors politically, economically, and militarily;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the United States must develop a clear understanding that state-sponsored terrorism threatens United States values and interests, and that active measures are needed to counter more effectively the terrorist threat; and</p>
