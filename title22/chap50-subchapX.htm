<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) experience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of workers to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) safeguards the public interest,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) facilitates and encourages the amicable settlement of disputes between workers and their employers involving conditions of employment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public interest demands the highest standards of performance by members of the Service and the continuous development and implementation of modern and progressive work practices to facilitate improved performance and efficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the unique conditions of Foreign Service employment require a distinct framework for the development and implementation of modern, constructive, and cooperative relationships between management officials and organizations representing members of the Service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Therefore, labor organizations and collective bargaining in the Service are in the public interest and are consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government. The provisions of this subchapter should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Department or labor organization is charged by any person with having engaged in or engaging in an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall investigate the charge and may issue and cause to be served upon the Department or labor organization a complaint. In any case in which the General Counsel does not issue a complaint because the charge fails to state an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall provide the person making the charge a written statement of the reasons for not issuing a complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice in complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any complaint under subsection (a) of this section shall contain a notice&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) of the time and place fixed for the hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Answer; personal appearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The labor organization or Department involved shall have the right to file an answer to the original and any amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint for the hearing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge with the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the General Counsel determines that the person filing any charge was prevented from filing the charge during the 6-month period referred to in paragraph (1) by reason of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any failure of the Department or labor organization against which the charge is made to perform a duty owed to the person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any concealment which prevented discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice during the 6-month period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the General Counsel may issue a complaint based on the charge if the charge was filed during the 6-month period beginning on the day of the discovery by the person of the alleged unfair labor practice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) shall conduct a hearing on the complaint not earlier than 5 days after the date on which the complaint is served. In the discretion of the individual or individuals conducting the hearing, any person involved may be allowed to intervene in the hearing and to present testimony. Any such hearing shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, except that the parties shall not be bound by rules of evidence, whether statutory, common law, or adopted by a court.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Findings of fact relative to issuance of orders; backpay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) determines after any hearing on a complaint under subsection (f) of this section that the preponderance of the evidence received demonstrates that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, then the individual or individuals conducting the hearing shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the Department or labor organization an order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice in which the Department or labor organization is engaged;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) service as a management official or confidential employee is prohibited on the part of any individual having participated in the management of a labor organization for purposes of collective bargaining or having acted as a representative of a labor organization during the preceding two years.</p>
