<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Middle East terrorism accounted for 60 percent of total international terrorism in 1985;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the &ldquo;PLO&rdquo;) was directly responsible for the murder of an American citizen on the Achille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, and a member of the PLO's Executive Committee is under indictment in the United States for the murder of that American citizen;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the head of the PLO has been implicated in the murder of a United States Ambassador overseas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the PLO and its constituent groups have taken credit for, and been implicated in, the murders of dozens of American citizens abroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the PLO covenant specifically states that &ldquo;armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine, thus it is an overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the PLO rededicated itself to the &ldquo;continuing struggle in all its armed forms&rdquo; at the Palestine National Council meeting in April 1987; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Attorney General has stated that &ldquo;various elements of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its allies and affiliates are in the thick of international terror&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, the Congress determines that the PLO and its affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat to the interests of the United States, its allies, and to international law and should not benefit from operating in the United States.</p>
