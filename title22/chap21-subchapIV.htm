(a) The Congress hereby approves the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic on the Settlement of Certain Outstanding Claims and Financial Issues, initialed at Prague, Czechoslovakia on November 6, 1981.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The President may, without further approval by the Congress, execute such technical revisions of the Agreement approved by subsection (a) of this section as in his judgment may from time to time be required to facilitate the implementation of that Agreement. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize any revision of that Agreement to reduce any amount to be paid by the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to the United States Government under the Agreement, or to defer the payment of any such amount.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) &lsquo;national of the United States&rsquo; has the meaning given such term by section 401(1) of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1642(1)];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) &lsquo;Commission&rsquo; means the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) &lsquo;property&rsquo; means any property, right, or interest.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;the fund</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) The Secretary shall cover into the Fund the amount paid by the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in settlement and discharge of claims of nationals of the United States pursuant to article 1(1) of the Agreement, and shall deduct from that amount $50,000 for reimbursement to the United States Government for expenses incurred by the Department of the Treasury and the Commission in the administration of this Act and title IV of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [this subchapter]. The amount so deducted shall be covered into the Treasury to the credit of miscellaneous receipts. The deduction required by this subsection shall be made in lieu of the deduction provided in section 402(e) of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1642a(e)]; however, it is the sense of the Congress that the United States Government is entitled to a larger percentage of the total award (generally presumed to be 5 percent) and that the ex gratia payment hereinafter provided to certain claimants, who were otherwise excluded from sharing in this claims settlement under generally-accepted principles of international law and United States practice, is justified only by the extraordinary circumstances of this case and does not establish any precedent for future claims negotiations or payments.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Secretary shall establish three accounts in the Fund into which the amount covered into the Fund pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, less the deduction required by that subsection, shall be covered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) An account into which $74,550,000 shall be covered, to be available for payment in accordance with section 8 of this Act on account of awards certified pursuant to section 410 of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1642i].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) An account into which $1,500,000 shall be covered, to be available for payment in accordance with section 8 of this Act on account of awards determined pursuant to section 5 of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) An account into which the remainder of amounts in the Fund shall be covered, to be available <!-- PDFPage:354 -->for payment in accordance with section 8 of this Act on account of awards determined pursuant to section 6 of this Act.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;determination of certain claims</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) The Commission shall receive and determine, in accordance with applicable substantive law, including international law, the validity and amount of claims by nationals of the United States against the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic for losses resulting from the nationalization or other taking of property owned at the time by nationals of the United States, which nationalization or other taking occurred between August 8, 1958, and the date on which the Agreement enters into force. In making the determination with respect to the validity and amount of any such claim and the value of the property taken, the Commission is authorized to accept the fair or proved value of such property as of the time when the property taken was last operated, used, managed, or controlled by the national or nationals of the United States asserting the claim, regardless of whether such time is prior to the actual date of nationalization or other taking by the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Commission shall certify to the Secretary the amount of any award determined pursuant to subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;determination of other claims</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. (a)(1) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) in the case of certain persons holding claims against the Czechoslovakian Government who became nationals of the United States by February 26, 1948, the date on which the current Communist Government of Czechoslovakia assumed power; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) while the Commission had the authority to deny those claims described in subparagraph (A) on the basis that the properties involved had been taken by the Benes Government while the claimants were not yet nationals of the United States, the effect of that denial is to withhold compensation to persons who have been United States citizens for many years and whose expropriated property has benefited the Communist Government of Czechoslovakia no less than properties expropriated more directly and clearly by the Communist Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2)(A) It is therefore the purpose of this section, in accordance with the intent of the Congress in enacting title IV of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [this subchapter] and in the interests of equity, to make ex gratia payments to the claimants described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) The Congress reaffirms the principle and practice of the United States to seek compensation from foreign governments on behalf only of persons who were nationals of the United States at the time they sustained losses by the nationalization or other taking of their property by those foreign governments. In making payments under this section, the Congress does not establish any precedent for future claims payments.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Commission shall reopen and redetermine the validity and amount of any claim against the Government of Czechoslovakia which was filed with the Commission in accordance with the provisions of title IV of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [this subchapter], which was based on property found by the Commission to have been nationalized or taken by the Government of Czechoslovakia on or after January 1, 1945, and before February 26, 1948, and which was denied by the Commission because such property was not owned by a person who was a national of the United States on the date of such nationalization or taking. The provisions of section 405 of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1642d] requiring that the property upon which a claim is based must have been owned by a national of the United States on the date of nationalization or other taking by the Government of Czechoslovakia shall be deemed to be met if such property was owned on such date by a person who became a national of the United States on or before February 26, 1948. The Commission shall certify to the Secretary the amount of any award determined pursuant to this subsection.</p>
