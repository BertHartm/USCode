<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall determine which of the basic salary rates prescribed by the President under paragraph (1) for any salary class shall be paid to each member of the Senior Foreign Service who is appointed to that class. The Secretary may adjust the basic salary rate of a member of the Senior Foreign Service not more than once during any 12-month period.</p>
