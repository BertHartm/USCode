<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;187, June 10, 2002, 116 Stat. 590, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act of 2002&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103&ndash;447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared that &lsquo;full and active participants in the Partnership for Peace in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area should be invited to become full NATO members in accordance with Article 10 of such Treaty at an early date&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title VI of section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law 104&ndash;208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for the prompt admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia to NATO, and declared that &lsquo;in order to promote economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of division G of Public Law 105&ndash;277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared that &lsquo;Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO&rsquo; and that &lsquo;Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would make an outstanding contribution to furthering the goals of NATO and enhancing stability, freedom, and peace in Europe should they become NATO members [and] upon complete satisfaction of all relevant criteria should be invited to become full NATO members at the earliest possible date&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) At the Madrid Summit of the NATO Alliance in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were invited to join the Alliance in the first round of NATO enlargement, and the NATO heads of state and government issued a declaration stating &lsquo;[t]he Alliance expects to extend further invitations in coming years to nations willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [n]o European democratic country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of the [North Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded from consideration&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) At the Washington Summit of the NATO Alliance in April 1999, the NATO heads of state and government issued a communique declaring &lsquo;[w]e pledge that NATO will continue to welcome new members in a position to further the principles of the [North Atlantic] Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [t]he three new members will not be the last .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [n]o European democratic country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from consideration, regardless of its geographic location&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In late 2002, NATO will hold a summit in Prague, the Czech Republic, at which it will decide which additional emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to invite to join the Alliance in the next round of NATO enlargement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In May 2000 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the foreign ministers of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia issued a statement (later joined by Croatia) declaring that their countries will cooperate in jointly seeking NATO membership in the next round of NATO enlargement, that the realization of NATO membership by one or more of these countries would be a success for all, and that eventual NATO membership for all of these countries would be a success for Europe and NATO.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, President George W. Bush stated &lsquo;[a]ll of Europe's new democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie between, should have the same chance for security and freedom&mdash;and the same chance to join the institutions of Europe&mdash;as Europe's old democracies have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I believe in NATO membership <!-- PDFPage:380 -->for all of Europe's democracies that seek it and are ready to share the responsibilities that NATO brings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [a]s we plan to enlarge NATO, no nation should be used as a pawn in the agenda of others .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [w]e will not trade away the fate of free European peoples .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [n]o more Munichs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [n]o more Yaltas .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [a]s we plan the Prague Summit, we should not calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we can do to advance the cause of freedom&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, former President William J. Clinton stated &lsquo;NATO's doors will not close behind its first new members .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. NATO should remain open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to shoulder the responsibilities of membership .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [n]o nation will be automatically excluded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [n]o country outside NATO will have a veto .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [a] gray zone of insecurity must not reemerge in Europe&rsquo;.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2702. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Policy With Respect to NATO Enlargement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress urges the President to outline a clear and complete strategic rationale for the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States should ensure that NATO continues a process whereby all other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that wish to join NATO will be considered for membership in NATO as soon as they meet the criteria for such membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States should ensure that no limitations are placed on the numbers of NATO troops or types of equipment, including tactical nuclear weapons, to be deployed on the territory of new member states;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the United States should reject all efforts to condition NATO decisions on review or approval by the United Nations Security Council;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the United States should clearly delineate those NATO deliberations, including but not limited to discussions on arms control, further Alliance en<!-- PDFPage:381 -->largement, procurement matters, and strategic doctrine, that are not subject to review or discussion in the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the United States should work to ensure that countries invited to join the Alliance are provided an immediate seat in NATO discussions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the United States already pays more than a proportionate share of the costs of the common defense of Europe and should obtain, in advance, agreement on an equitable distribution of the cost of NATO enlargement to ensure that the United States does not continue to bear a disproportionate burden.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy With Respect to Negotiations With Russia.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Implementation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;NATO enlargement should be carried out in such a manner as to underscore the Alliance's defensive nature and demonstrate to Russia that NATO enlargement will enhance the security of all countries in Europe, including Russia. Accordingly, the United States and its NATO allies should make this intention clear in negotiations with Russia, including negotiations regarding adaptation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty of November 19, 1990.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on commitments to russia</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In seeking to demonstrate to Russia NATO's defensive and security-enhancing intentions, it is essential that neither fundamental United States security interests in Europe nor the effectiveness and flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance be jeopardized. In particular, no commitments should be made to Russia that would have the effect of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) extending rights or imposing responsibilities on new NATO members different from those applicable to current NATO members, including rights or responsibilities with respect to the deployment of nuclear weapons and the stationing of troops and equipment from other NATO members;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) limiting the ability of NATO to defend the territory of new NATO members by, for example, restricting the construction of defense infrastructure or limiting the ability of NATO to deploy necessary reinforcements;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) providing any international organization, or any country that is not a member of NATO, with authority to delay, veto, or otherwise impede deliberations and decisions of the North Atlantic Council or the implementation of such decisions, including deliberations and decisions with respect to the deployment of NATO forces or the admission of additional members to NATO;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) impeding the development of enhanced relations between NATO and other European countries that do not belong to the Alliance;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in Central or Eastern Europe;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) requiring NATO to subsidize Russian arms sales, service, or support to the militaries of those former Warsaw Pact countries invited to join the Alliance; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) legitimizing Russian efforts to link concessions in arms control negotiations to NATO enlargement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Commitments from russia</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to enhance security and stability in Europe, the United States should seek commitments from Russia&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to demarcate and respect all its borders with neighboring states;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to achieve the immediate and complete withdrawal of any armed forces and military equipment under the control of Russia that are deployed on the territories of the independent states of the former Soviet Union without the full and complete agreement of those states;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to station its armed forces on the territory of other states only with the full and complete agreement of that state and in strict accordance with international law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) to take steps to reduce further its nuclear and conventional forces in Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Consultations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As negotiations on adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe proceed, the United States should engage in close and continuous consultations not only with its NATO allies, but also with the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine, and the South Caucasus.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Policy With Respect to Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As the United States proceeds with efforts to develop defenses against ballistic missile attack, it should seek to foster a climate of cooperation with Russia on matters related to missile defense. In particular, the United States and its NATO allies should seek to cooperate with Russia in such areas as early warning.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Discussions with nato allies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States should initiate discussions with its NATO allies for the purpose of examining the feasibility of deploying a ballistic missile defense capable of protecting NATO's southern and eastern flanks from a limited ballistic missile attack.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Constitutional prerogatives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Even as the Congress seeks to promote ballistic missile defense cooperation with Russia, it must insist on its constitutional prerogatives regarding consideration of arms control agreements with Russia that bear on ballistic missile defense.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2703. AUTHORITIES RELATING TO NATO ENLARGEMENT.</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">NATO Enlargement Facilitation</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;208, div. A, title I, &sect;101(c) [title VI], Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009&ndash;121, 3009&ndash;173, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 602. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and its partners in the Alliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to the security of the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creating the stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully complete political and economic transformation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States continues to regard the political independence and territorial integrity of all emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace and security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those countries seeking NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different occasions since 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new members into NATO.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Lasting security and stability in Europe requires not only the military integration of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe into existing European structures, but also the eventual economic and political integration of these countries into existing European structures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making available the resources necessary to supplement efforts prospective new members are themselves undertaking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) New members will be full members of the Alliance, enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington on April 4, 1949 (hereafter in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Washington Treaty&rsquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In order to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO to be prepared to assume the responsibilities of NATO membership, the United States should encourage and support efforts by such countries to develop force structures and force modernization priorities that will enable such countries to contribute to the full range of NATO missions, including, most importantly, territorial defense of the Alliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving emerging democracies in Central and East<!-- PDFPage:384 -->ern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force, can make an important contribution to European peace and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can assist those countries preparing to assume the responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly should receive appropriate support from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) NATO remains the only multilateral security organization capable of conducting effective military operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a positive role in defusing tensions between members of the Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred between two Alliance member states since the inception of NATO in 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a position to further the principles of the Washington Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance the security of the region. Countries which have become democracies and established market economies, which practice good neighborly relations, and which have established effective democratic civilian control over their defense establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the principles of the Washington Treaty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Democratic civilian control of defense forces is an essential element in the process of preparation for those states interested in possible NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights is an integral aspect of genuine security, and in evaluating requests for membership in NATO, the human rights records of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be evaluated according to their commitments to fulfill in good faith the human rights obligations of the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the Helsinki Final Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) A number of Central and Eastern European countries have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) The Caucasus region remains important geographically and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United States and NATO should continue to examine means to strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of United Nations recognized countries in that region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) In recognition that not all countries which have requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance should include those emerging democracies most ready for closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward eventual NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) The Congress of the United States finds in particular that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made significant progress toward achieving the criteria set forth in section 203(d)(3) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;447, set out in a note below] and should be eligible for the additional assistance described in this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of all NATO members.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) The process of NATO enlargement entails the consensus agreement of the governments of all 16 NATO members and ratification in accordance with their constitutional procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory although they are accorded the full collective security guarantees provided by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO members, particularly in the current security climate. However, NATO retains the right to alter its security posture at any time as circumstances warrant.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 603. UNITED STATES POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War world;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to support the enlargement of NATO in recognition that enlargement will benefit the interests of the United States and the Alliance and to consider these benefits in any analysis of the costs of NATO enlargement;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure that all countries in Central and Eastern Europe are fully aware of and capable of assuming the costs and responsibilities of NATO membership, including the obligation set forth in Article 10 of the Washington Treaty that new members be able to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to work to define a constructive and cooperative political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian Federation.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 604. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER ENLARGEMENT OF NATO.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States should continue and expand its support for the full and active participation of these countries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic means available to press the European Union to admit as soon as possible any country which qualifies for membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Russia; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 605. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA AND LITHUANIA.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50 years, it is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical security concerns that must be taken into account by the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance will continue for the foreseeable future to rely on a modern and credible nuclear deterrent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) NATO should make every effort to achieve the goal of raising the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict in Europe.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) While recognizing that there is a critical need for improvements in conventional forces, Congress also recognizes that the United States will have to devote defense resources in the future to the continuing modernization of the theater nuclear capabilities of NATO.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The modernization of the theater nuclear capabilities of NATO is a continuing process and stems from the 1983 Montebello decision by NATO to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons in Europe while taking steps to ensure that the remaining nuclear weapons of the alliance are responsive, survivable, and effective.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Programs to modernize theater nuclear forces, which had a high priority for NATO before the ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, are at least as important following the ratification of that treaty in May 1988.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The NATO Nuclear Planning Group recently reaffirmed its endorsement of development by the United States of a new missile for delivery of theater nuclear weapons as a follow-on to the current Lance missile, with a view toward an eventual decision on deployment of such a follow-on missile.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Japan-United States security relationship is the foundation of the peace and security of Japan <!-- PDFPage:390 -->and the Far East, as well as a major contributor to the protection of the United States and of the democratic freedoms and economic prosperity enjoyed by both the United States and Japan;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the threats to our two democracies have increased significantly since 1976, principally through the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the expansion of Soviet armed forces in the Far East, the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam, and the instability in the Persian Gulf region as signified by the continuing Iran-Iraq conflict;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) in recognition of these and other threats, the United States has greatly increased its annual defense spending through sustained real growth averaging 8.8 percent yearly between fiscal 1981 and 1985, and cumulative real growth of 50 percent in that period;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the United States Government applauds the policy of Japan to obtain the capabilities to defend its sea and air lanes out to 1,000 miles, expects that these capabilities should be acquired by the end of the decade, and recognizes that achieving those capabilities would significantly improve the national security of both Japan and the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the United States Government appreciates the contribution already made by Japan through the Host Nation Support Program and its recent efforts to increase its defense spending; and</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) that fulfillment by NATO member nations of their goals and commitments to increase defense spending, improve conventional sustainability, and provide support facilities in Western Europe for rapid reinforcements from the United States is crucial to accomplishing that objective; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) that an increase over current United States military personnel levels in European member nations of NATO can be justified only if these goals and commitments are substantially met by NATO member nations (other than the United States).</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Japan is the ally of the United States with the greatest potential for improving its self-defense capabilities and should, therefore, rapidly increase its annual defense spending to the levels required to fulfill that pledge and to enable Japan to be capable of an effective conventional self-defense capability by 1990, including the capability to carry out its 1,000-mile defense policy, a development that would be consonant not only with Japan's current prominent position in the family of nations but also with its unique sensibilities on the issues of war and peace, sensibilities that are recognized and respected by the people of the United States; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 11633. Dec. 3, 1971, 36 F.R. 23197, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States now participates in the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). The Security regulations of these three treaty organizations provide that each participating nation shall be responsible for the security screening and security clearance of its own citizens before they are authorized access to the Organization's TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information. There is no existing program, however, under which United States civilians who are hired directly by these organizations can be screened and cleared for access to such Organization's TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information while so employed. It is, of course, in the interest of the United States that United States citizens who participate in the activities of NATO, SEATO, and CENTO as direct hire employees of the civil or military agencies of those organizations be reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States. At the same time, it is a fundamental principle of our Government to protect against unreasonable or unwarranted encroachment on the freedom and privacy of individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have determined that the provisions and procedures prescribed by this Order are necessary to assure the preservation of the integrity of the classified information of NATO, SEATO, and CENTO, and to protect the national interest. I have also determined that these provisions and procedures recognize the rights of individuals affected thereby and provide maximum possible safeguards to protect such rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, it is ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. The Secretary of Defense shall establish a program and, by regulation, shall prescribe such specific requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards as he considers necessary for the administration of procedures whereby &ldquo;Certificates of Security Clearance&rdquo; for the United States citizens directly employed by civil or military agencies of NATO, SEATO, or CENTO may be provided to these international organizations when they so request. Such program shall also provide for the denial, revocation, or suspension of such &ldquo;Certificates.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. Subject to the provisions of applicable international agreements, the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense shall, insofar as is practical, be similar to those established by him pursuant to the authority vested in him by Executive Order No. 10865 of February 20, 1960, as amended [set out as a note under section 435 of Title 50, War and National Defense].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. The substance of the criteria, safeguards, and procedures provided in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of Executive Order No. 10865, as amended [set out as a note under section 435 of Title 50, War and National Defense], shall be incorporated in the regulations of the Secretary of Defense governing the program established hereunder.</p>
