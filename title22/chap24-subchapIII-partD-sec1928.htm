<h4 class="note-head">NATO Enlargement Facilitation</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;208, div. A, title I, &sect;101(c) [title VI], Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009&ndash;121, 3009&ndash;173, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 602. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and its partners in the Alliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to the security of the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creating the stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully complete political and economic transformation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States continues to regard the political independence and territorial integrity of all emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace and security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those countries seeking NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different occasions since 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new members into NATO.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Lasting security and stability in Europe requires not only the military integration of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe into existing European structures, but also the eventual economic and political integration of these countries into existing European structures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making available the resources necessary to supplement efforts prospective new members are themselves undertaking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) New members will be full members of the Alliance, enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington on April 4, 1949 (hereafter in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Washington Treaty&rsquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In order to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO to be prepared to assume the responsibilities of NATO membership, the United States should encourage and support efforts by such countries to develop force structures and force modernization priorities that will enable such countries <!-- PDFPage:360 -->to contribute to the full range of NATO missions, including, most importantly, territorial defense of the Alliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force, can make an important contribution to European peace and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can assist those countries preparing to assume the responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly should receive appropriate support from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) NATO remains the only multilateral security organization capable of conducting effective military operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a positive role in defusing tensions between members of the Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred between two Alliance member states since the inception of NATO in 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a position to further the principles of the Washington Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance the security of the region. Countries which have become democracies and established market economies, which practice good neighborly relations, and which have established effective democratic civilian control over their defense establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the principles of the Washington Treaty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Democratic civilian control of defense forces is an essential element in the process of preparation for those states interested in possible NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights is an integral aspect of genuine security, and in evaluating requests for membership in NATO, the human rights records of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be evaluated according to their commitments to fulfill in good faith the human rights obligations of the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the Helsinki Final Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) A number of Central and Eastern European countries have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) The Caucasus region remains important geographically and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United States and NATO should continue to examine means to strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of United Nations recognized countries in that region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) In recognition that not all countries which have requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance should include those emerging democracies most ready for closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward eventual NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) The Congress of the United States finds in particular that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made significant progress toward achieving the criteria set forth in section 203(d)(3) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;447, set out in a note below] and should be eligible for the additional assistance described in this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of all NATO members.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) The process of NATO enlargement entails the consensus agreement of the governments of all 16 NATO members and ratification in accordance with their constitutional procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory although they are accorded the full collective security guarantees provided by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO members, particularly in the current security climate. However, NATO retains the right to alter its security posture at any time as circumstances warrant.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 603. UNITED STATES POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War world;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to support the enlargement of NATO in recognition that enlargement will benefit the interests of the United States and the Alliance and to consider these benefits in any analysis of the costs of NATO enlargement;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure that all countries in Central and Eastern Europe are fully aware of and capable of assuming the costs and responsibilities of NATO membership, including the obligation set forth in Article 10 of the Washington Treaty that new members be able to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to work to define a constructive and cooperative political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian Federation.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 604. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER ENLARGEMENT OF NATO.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States should continue and expand its support for the full and active participation of these countries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic means available to press the European Union to admit as soon as possible any country which qualifies for membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Russia; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 605. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA AND LITHUANIA.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50 years, it is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical security concerns that must be taken into account by the United States; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:361 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 606. DESIGNATION OF COUNTRIES ELIGIBLE FOR NATO ENLARGEMENT ASSISTANCE.</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance will continue for the foreseeable future to rely on a modern and credible nuclear deterrent.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 11633. Security Clearance Program for United States Citizens Employed Directly by NATO, SEATO, and CENTO</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 11633. Dec. 3, 1971, 36 F.R. 23197, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States now participates in the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). The Security regulations of these three treaty organizations provide that each participating nation shall be responsible for the security screening and security clearance of its own citizens before they are authorized access to the Organization's TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information. There is no existing program, however, under which United States civilians who are hired directly by these organizations can be screened and cleared for access to such Organization's TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information while so employed. It is, of course, in the interest of the United States that United States citizens who participate in the activities of NATO, SEATO, and CENTO as direct hire employees of the civil or military agencies of those organizations be reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States. At the same time, it is a fundamental principle of our Government to protect against unreasonable or unwarranted encroachment on the freedom and privacy of individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have determined that the provisions and procedures prescribed by this Order are necessary to assure the preservation of the integrity of the classified information of NATO, SEATO, and CENTO, and to protect the national interest. I have also determined that these provisions and procedures recognize the rights of individuals affected thereby and provide maximum possible safeguards to protect such rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, it is ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. The Secretary of Defense shall establish a program and, by regulation, shall prescribe such specific requirements, restrictions, and other safeguards as he considers necessary for the administration of procedures whereby &ldquo;Certificates of Security Clearance&rdquo; for the United States citizens directly employed by civil or military agencies of NATO, SEATO, or CENTO may be provided to these international organizations when they so request. Such program shall also provide for the denial, revocation, or suspension of such &ldquo;Certificates.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. Subject to the provisions of applicable international agreements, the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense shall, insofar as is practical, be similar to those established by him pursuant to the authority vested in him by Executive Order No. 10865 of February 20, 1960, as amended [set out as a note under section 435 of Title 50, War and National Defense].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. The substance of the criteria, safeguards, and procedures provided in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of Executive Order No. 10865, as amended [set out as a note under section 435 of Title 50, War and National Defense], shall be incorporated in the regulations of the Secretary of Defense governing the program established hereunder.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. Any authority vested in the Secretary of Defense by this Order may be delegated to the Deputy Secretary of Defense or an Assistant Secretary of Defense.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense</p>
<p class="note-body">Consistent with section 406(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (Public Law 101&ndash;510; 104 Stat. 1546) [amending section 1002 of Pub. L. 98&ndash;525, set out as a note above], I hereby authorize an end strength level of members of the Armed Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in excess of 261,855 for fiscal year 1991, and determine that the national security interests of the United States require such authorization.</p>
