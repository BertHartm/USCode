<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) United States development cooperation policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect <!-- PDFPage:434 -->individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world's limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">United States development cooperation policy should emphasize five principal goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alleviation of the worst physical manifestations of poverty among the world's poor majority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the promotion of conditions enabling developing countries to achieve self-sustaining economic growth with equitable distribution of benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the encouragement of development processes in which individual civil and economic rights are respected and enhanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the integration of the developing countries into an open and equitable international economic system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the promotion of good governance through combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United States foreign policy and that United States development resources be effectively and efficiently utilized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of development-related activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the policy guidance of the Secretary of State, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should have the responsibility for coordinating all United States development-related activities.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">&ldquo;TITLE I&mdash;BILATERAL ACTION ON ADDRESSING URGENT NEEDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The National Security Strategy of the United States, dated September 17, 2002, concludes that &lsquo;[i]n Africa, promise and opportunity sit side-by-side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror. American interests and American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) On February 16, 2005, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency testified, &lsquo;In Africa, chronic instability will continue to hamper counterterrorism efforts and pose heavy humanitarian and peacekeeping burdens.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the United States Agency for International Development, &lsquo;Given its size, population, and resources, the Congo is an important player in Africa and of long-term interest to the United States.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Democratic Republic of the Congo is 2,345,410 square miles (approximately 1/4 the size of the United States), lies at the heart of Africa, and touches every major region of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, a secure, peaceful, and prosperous Democratic Republic of the Congo would have a profound impact on progress throughout Africa.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The most recent war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which erupted in 1998, spawned some of the world's worst human rights atrocities and drew in six neighboring countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Despite the conclusion of a peace agreement and subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, both the real and perceived presence of armed groups hostile to the Governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi continue to serve as a major source of regional instability and an apparent pretext for continued interference in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by its neighbors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) A mortality study completed in December 2004 by the International Rescue Committee found that 31,000 people were dying monthly and 3,800,000 people had died in the previous six years because of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and resulting disintegration of the social service infrastructure, making this one of the deadliest conflicts since World War II.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) In 2004, Amnesty International estimated that at least 40,000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1998, and nearly two-thirds of ongoing abuses against women and girls are perpetrated by members of the security forces, particularly the Forces Armes de la Republique Democratique du Congo (FARDC) and the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) According to the Department of State, &lsquo;returning one of Africa's largest countries [the Democratic Republic of the Congo] to full peace and stability will <!-- PDFPage:441 -->require significant United States investments in support of national elections, the reintegration of former combatants, the return and reintegration of refugees and [internally displaced persons], establishment of central government control over vast territories, and promotion of national reconciliation and good governance&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to help promote, reinvigorate, and support the political process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to press all parties in the Transitional National Government and the succeeding government to implement fully and to institutionalize mechanisms, including national and international election observers, fair and transparent voter registration procedures, and a significant civic awareness and public education campaign created for the July 30, 2006, elections and future elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to ensure that elections are carried out in a fair and democratic manner;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces, hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations, particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war, accountable and bring such individuals to justice;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to help ensure that, once a stable national government is established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is committed to multiparty democracy, open and transparent governance, respect for human rights and religious freedom, ending the violence throughout the country, promoting peace and stability with its neighbors, rehabilitating the national judicial system and enhancing the rule of law, combating corruption, instituting economic reforms to promote development, and creating an environment to promote private investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as it seeks to meet the basic needs of its citizens, including security, safety, and access to health care, education, food, shelter, and clean drinking water;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to support security sector reform by assisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to establish a viable and professional national army and police force that respects human rights and the rule of law, is under effective civilian control, and possesses a viable presence throughout the entire country, provided the Democratic Republic of the Congo meets all requirements for United States military assistance under existing law;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to help expedite planning and implementation of programs associated with the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration, and rehabilitation process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to support efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), and other entities, as appropriate, to disarm, demobilize, and repatriate the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and other illegally armed groups;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to make all efforts to ensure that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) is committed to responsible and transparent management of natural resources across the country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) takes active measures&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) to promote economic development;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) to hold accountable individuals who illegally exploit the country's natural resources; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative by enacting laws requiring disclosure and independent auditing of company payments and government receipts for natural resource extraction;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to promote a viable civil society and to enhance nongovernmental organizations and institutions, including religious organizations, the media, political parties, trade unions, and trade and business associations, that can act as a stabilizing force and effective check on the government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) to help rebuild and enhance infrastructure, communications, and other mechanisms that will increase the ability of the central government to manage internal affairs, encourage economic development, and facilitate relief efforts of humanitarian organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) to help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health, education, and psycho-social support programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) to work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards, promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions, and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as undertakes steps to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) protect internally displaced persons and refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and border regions from all forms of violence, including gender-based violence and other human rights abuses;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) address other basic needs of vulnerable populations with the goal of allowing these conflict-affected individuals to ultimately return to their homes; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) assess the magnitude of the problem of orphans from conflict and HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and work to establish a program of national support;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) to engage with governments working to promote peace and security throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo and hold accountable individuals, entities, and countries working to destabilize the country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) to promote appropriate use of the forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a manner that benefits the rural population in that country that depends on the forests for their livelihoods and protects national and environmental interests.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 103. BILATERAL ASSISTANCE TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Funding for Fiscal Years</cap-smallcap> 2006 <cap-smallcap>and</cap-smallcap> 2007.&mdash;Of the amounts made available to carry out the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] (68 Stat. 454, chapter 469), and the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) for fiscal year 2006 and 2007, at least $52,000,000 for each such fiscal year should be allocated for bilateral assistance programs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Future Year Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State should submit budget requests in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 that contain increases in bilateral assistance for the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are appropriate if progress is being made, particularly cooperation by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, toward accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Coordination With Other Donor Nations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States should work with other donor nations, on a bilateral and multilateral basis, to increase international contributions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and accomplish the policy objectives described in section 102.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:442 --><h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 104. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be committed to achieving the policy objectives described in section 102 if the efforts of the United States and other members of the international community are to be effective in bringing relief, security, and democracy to the country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should immediately exercise control over and discipline its armed forces, stop the mass rapes at the hands of its armed forces, and hold those responsible for these acts accountable before an appropriate tribunal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in collaboration with international aid agencies, should establish expert teams to assess the needs of the victims of rape and provide health, counseling, and social support services that such victims need; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the international community, through the United Nations peacekeeping mission, humanitarian and development relief, and other forms of assistance, is providing a substantial amount of funding that is giving the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo an opportunity to make progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102, but this assistance cannot continue in perpetuity.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should withhold assistance otherwise available under this Act if the Secretary determines that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 105. WITHHOLDING OF ASSISTANCE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Secretary of State is authorized to withhold assistance made available under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), other than humanitarian, peacekeeping, and counterterrorism assistance, for a foreign country if the Secretary determines that the government of the foreign country is taking actions to destabilize the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) recommendations for&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to allow for the more effective protection and monitoring of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially in the eastern part of the country, and for public disclosure and independent auditing of natural resource revenues to help ensure transparent and accountable management of these revenues;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;175, Dec. 12, 2003, 117 Stat. 2482, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On June 24, 2002, President Bush stated &lsquo;Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states &lsquo;refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts&rsquo;, take &lsquo;the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts&rsquo;, and &lsquo;deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by United States law from receiving United States assistance because it has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for purposes of section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) and other relevant provisions of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides &lsquo;safe haven and support to several terrorist groups&rsquo;, fewer United States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect to any other country that is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&mdash;General Command, maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities <!-- PDFPage:444 -->on Syrian territory, and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran through Syria.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for &lsquo;strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Approximately 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining its political independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have passed seven bills and resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) On March 3, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that it is the objective of the United States to &lsquo;let Lebanon be ruled by the Lebanese people without the presence of [the Syrian] occupation army&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United Nations Secretary General.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Even in the face of this United Nations certification that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah continues to attack Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the pretense that Shebaa Farms is territory from which Israel was required to withdraw by Security Counsel Resolution 425, and Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah and other militant organizations continue to attack civilian targets in Israel.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Syria will not allow Lebanon&mdash;a sovereign country&mdash;to fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which continues to attack Israeli positions, allows Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate freely in the area, and maintains thousands of rockets along Israel's northern border, destabilizing the entire region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) On February 12, 2003, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet stated the following with respect to the Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah: &lsquo;[A]s an organization with capability and worldwide presence [it] is [al Qaeda's] equal if not a far more capable organization *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [T]hey're a notch above in many respects, in terms of in their relationship with the Iranians and the training they receive, [which] puts them in a state-sponsored category with a potential for lethality that's quite great.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, President Bush declared that the United States will &lsquo;work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) The Government of Syria continues to develop and deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) On May 6, 2002, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, stated: &lsquo;The United States also knows that Syria has long had a chemical warfare program.

Under Secretary Bolton added that: &lsquo;Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [Syria's] behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syria's WMD capabilities.&rsquo;.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">African Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;381, Oct. 19, 1994, 108 Stat. 3513, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;African Conflict Resolution Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa's future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa's children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. <!-- PDFPage:452 -->Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the experience of elder statesmen. Groups such as the All African Council of Churches have assisted in defusing conflicts. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has sought to address the conflict in Liberia by deploying an African peacekeeping force. The Southern African states have been working to prevent a crisis in Lesotho. The Intergovernmental Authority on Desertification and Drought (IGADD) has been engaged in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The Organization of African Unity, under the leadership of Secretary General Salim Salim, has established a conflict resolution mechanism and has been active in mediation and conflict resolution in several African countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>United States Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress declares, therefore, that a key goal for United States foreign policy should be to help institutionalize conflict resolution capability in Africa.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151&ndash;1. Development assistance policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Principal purpose of bilateral development assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to build and maintain the social and economic institutions necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth and to provide opportunities to improve the quality of life for their people depend primarily upon successfully marshalling their own economic and human resources. The Congress recognizes that the magnitude of these efforts exceeds the resources of developing countries and therefore accepts that there will be a long-term need for wealthy countries to contribute additional resources for development purposes. The United States should take the lead in concert with other nations to mobilize such resources from public and private sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Provision of development resources must be adapted to the needs and capabilities of specific developing countries. United States assistance to countries with low per capita incomes which have limited access to private external resources should primarily be provided on concessional terms. Assistance to other developing countries should generally consist of programs which facilitate their access to private capital markets, investment, and technical skills, whether directly through guarantee or reimbursable programs by the United States Government or indirectly through callable capital provided to the international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Bilateral assistance and United States participation in multilateral institutions shall emphasize programs in support of countries which pursue development strategies designed to meet basic human needs and achieve self-sustaining growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the principal purpose of United States bilateral development assistance is to help the poor majority of people in developing countries to participate in a process of equitable growth through productive work and to influence decisions that shape their lives, with the goal of increasing their incomes and their access to public services which will enable them to satisfy their basic needs and lead lives of decency, dignity, and hope. Activities shall be emphasized that effectively involve the poor in development by expanding their access to the economy through services and institutions at the local level, increasing their participation in the making of decisions that affect their lives, increasing labor-intensive production and the use of appropriate technology, expanding productive investment and services out from major cities to small towns and rural areas, and otherwise providing opportunities for the poor to improve their lives through their own efforts. Participation of the United States in multilateral institutions shall also place appropriate emphasis on these principles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Form of assistance; principles governing assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance under this part should be used not only for the purpose of transferring financial resources to developing countries, but also to help countries solve development problems in accordance with a strategy that aims to insure wide participation of the poor in the benefits of development on a sustained basis. Moreover, assistance shall be provided in a prompt and effective manner, using appropriate United States institutions for carrying out this strategy. In order to achieve these objectives and the broad objectives set forth in section 2151 of this title and in subsection (a) of this section, bilateral development assistance authorized by this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Development is primarily the responsibility of the people of the developing countries themselves. Assistance from the United States shall be used in support of, rather than substitution for, the self-help efforts that are essential to successful development programs and shall be concentrated in those countries that take positive steps to help themselves. Maximum effort shall be made, in the administration of subchapter I of this chapter, to stimulate the involvement of the people in the development process through the encouragement of democratic participation in private and local governmental activities and institution building appropriate to the requirements of the recipient countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Development planning must be the responsibility of each sovereign country. United States assistance should be administered in a collaborative style to support the development goals chosen by each country receiving assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States bilateral development assistance should give high priority to undertakings submitted by host governments which directly improve the lives of the poorest of their people and their capacity to participate in the development of their countries, while also helping such governments enhance their planning, technical, and administrative capabilities needed to insure the success of such undertakings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development assistance provided under this part shall be concentrated in countries which will make the most effective use of such assistance to help satisfy basic human needs of poor people through equitable growth, especially in those countries having the greatest need for outside assistance. In order to make possible consistent and informed judgments in this respect, the President shall assess the commitment and progress of countries in moving toward the objectives and purposes of this part by utilizing criteria, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increase in agricultural productivity per unit of land through small-farm, labor-intensive agriculture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduction of infant mortality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) control of population growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) promotion of greater equality of income distribution, including measures such as more progressive taxation and more equitable returns to small farmers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) reduction of rates of unemployment and underemployment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increase in literacy; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:459 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) progress in combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability in the public and private sector.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) United States development assistance should focus on critical problems in those functional sectors which affect the lives of the majority of the people in the developing countries; food production and nutrition; rural development and generation of gainful employment; population planning and health; environment and natural resources; education, development administration, and human resource development; and energy development and production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) United States assistance shall encourage and promote the participation of women in the national economies of developing countries and the improvement of women's status as an important means of promoting the total development effort.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) United States bilateral assistance shall recognize that the prosperity of developing countries and effective development efforts require the adoption of an overall strategy that promotes the development, production, and efficient utilization of energy and, therefore, consideration shall be given to the full implications of such assistance on the price, availability, and consumption of energy in recipient countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) United States cooperation in development should be carried out to the maximum extent possible through the private sector, including those institutions which already have ties in the developing areas, such as educational institutions, cooperatives, credit unions, free labor unions, and private and voluntary agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the maximum extent practicable, United States private investment should be encouraged in economic and social development programs to which the United States lends support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Assistance shall be planned and utilized to encourage regional cooperation by developing countries in the solution of common problems and the development of shared resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Assistance efforts of the United States shall be planned and furnished to the maximum extent practicable in coordination and cooperation with assistance efforts of other countries, including the planning and implementation of programs and projects on a multilateral and multidonor basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) United States bilateral development assistance should be concentrated on projects which do not involve large-scale capital transfers. However, to the extent that such assistance does involve large-scale capital transfers, it should be furnished in association with contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) United States encouragement of policy reforms is necessary if developing countries are to achieve economic growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Development assistance should, as a fundamental objective, promote private sector activity in open and competitive markets in developing countries, recognizing such activity to be a productive and efficient means of achieving equitable and long term economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) United States cooperation in development should recognize as essential the need of developing countries to have access to appropriate technology in order to improve food and water, health and housing, education and employment, and agriculture and industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) United States assistance should focus on establishing and upgrading the institutional capacities of developing countries in order to promote long term development. An important component of institution building involves training to expand the human resource potential of people in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Economic reform and development of effective institutions of democratic governance are mutually reinforcing. The successful transition of a developing country is dependent upon the quality of its economic and governance institutions. Rule of law, mechanisms of accountability and transparency, security of person, property, and investments, are but a few of the critical governance and economic reforms that underpin the sustainability of broad-based economic growth. Programs in support of such reforms strengthen the capacity of people to hold their governments accountable and to create economic opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Worldwide cooperative effort to overcome aspects of absolute poverty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, recognizing the desirability of overcoming the worst aspects of absolute poverty by the end of this century by, among other measures, substantially lowering infant mortality and birth rates, and increasing life expectancy, food production, literacy, and employment, encourages the President to explore with other countries, through all appropriate channels, the feasibility of a worldwide cooperative effort to overcome the worst aspects of absolute poverty and to assure self-reliant growth in the developing countries by the year 2000.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151a. Agricultural development in rural areas</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization to President to furnish assistance; appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In recognition of the fact that the great majority of the people of developing countries live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture and agricultural-related pursuits for their livelihood, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to alleviate starvation, hunger, and malnutrition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to expand significantly the provision of basic services to rural poor people to enhance their capacity for self-help; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to help create productive farm and off-farm employment in rural areas to provide a more viable economic base and enhance opportunities for improved incomes, living standards, and contributions by rural poor people to the economic and social development of their countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1987. Of these amounts, the President may use such amounts as he deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of section 316 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980. Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,000,000 shall be available only for the purpose of controlling and eradicating amblyomma variegatum (heartwater) in bovine animals in the Caribbean.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use of assistance primarily in aid of rural poor; multilateral infrastructure projects; forestry projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance provided under this section shall be used primarily for activities which are specifically designed to increase the productivity and income of the rural poor, through such means as creation and strengthening of local institutions linked to the regional and national levels; organization of a system of financial institutions which provide both savings and credit services to the poor; stimulation of small, labor-intensive enterprises in rural towns; improvement of marketing facilities and systems; expansion of rural infrastructure and utilities such as farm-to-market roads, water management systems, land improvement, energy, and storage facilities; establishment of more equitable and more secure land tenure arrangements; and creation and strengthening of systems to provide other services and supplies needed by farmers, such as extension, research, training, fertilizer, water, forestry, soil conservation, and improved seed, in ways which assure access to them by small farmers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In circumstances where development of major infrastructure is necessary to achieve the objectives set forth in this section, assistance for that purpose should be furnished under this part in association with significant contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework. Infrastructure projects so assisted should be complemented by other measures to ensure that the benefits of the infrastructure reach the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the accelerating loss of forests and tree cover in developing countries undermines and offsets efforts to improve agricultural production and nutrition and otherwise to meet the basic human needs of the poor. Deforestation results in increased flooding, reduction in water supply for agricultural capacity, loss of firewood and needed wood products, and loss of valuable plants and animals. In order to maintain and increase forest resources, the President is authorized to provide assistance under this section for forestry projects which are essential to fulfill the fundamental purposes of this section. Emphasis shall be given to community woodlots, agroforestry, reforestation, protection of watershed forests, and more effective forest management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increased agricultural production in least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the greatest potential for significantly expanding availability of food for people in rural areas and augmenting world food production at relatively low cost lies in increasing the productivity of small farmers who constitute a majority of the agricultural producers in developing countries. Increasing the emphasis on rural development and expanded food production in the poorest nations of the developing world is a matter of social justice and a principal element contributing to broadly based economic growth, as well as an important factor in alleviating inflation in the industrialized countries. In the allocation of funds under this section, special attention shall be given to increasing agricultural production in countries which have been designated as &ldquo;least developed&rdquo; by the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination with population planning and health programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance provided under this section shall also be used in coordination with programs car<!-- PDFPage:461 -->ried out under section 2151b of this title to help improve nutrition of the people of developing countries through encouragement of increased production of crops with greater nutritional value; improvement of planning, research, and education with respect to nutrition, particularly with reference to improvement and expanded use of indigenously produced foodstuffs; and the undertaking of pilot or demonstration programs explicitly addressing the problem of malnutrition of poor and vulnerable people. In particular, the President is encouraged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to devise and carry out in partnership with developing countries a strategy for programs of nutrition and health improvement for mothers and children, including breast feeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide technical, financial, and material support to individuals or groups at the local level for such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of local currency proceeds from sales of commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Local currency proceeds from sales of commodities provided under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] which are owned by foreign governments shall be used whenever practicable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National food security policies and programs; bilateral and multilateral assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to enhance their national food security deserves encouragement as a matter of United States development assistance policy. Measures complementary to assistance for expanding food production in developing countries are needed to help assure that food becomes increasingly available on a regular basis to the poor in such countries. Therefore, United States bilateral assistance under this chapter and the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.], and United States participation in multilateral institutions, shall emphasize policies and programs which assist developing countries to increase their national food security by improving their food policies and management and by strengthening national food reserves, with particular concern for the needs of the poor, through measures encouraging domestic production, building national food reserves, expanding available storage facilities, reducing postharvest food losses, and improving food distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) International Fund for Agricultural Development; participation and contributions; availability of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to carry out the purposes of this section, the President may continue United States participation in and may make contributions to the International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Of the aggregate amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out subchapter I of this chapter, up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 may be made available, by appropriation or by transfer, for United States contributions to the second replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151b. Population planning and health programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that poor health conditions and uncontrolled population growth can <!-- PDFPage:463 -->vitiate otherwise successful development efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Large families in developing countries are the result of complex social and economic factors which change relatively slowly among the poor majority least affected by economic progress, as well as the result of a lack of effective birth control. Therefore, effective family planning depends upon economic and social change as well as the delivery of services and is often a matter of political and religious sensitivity. While every country has the right to determine its own policies with respect to population growth, voluntary population planning programs can make a substantial contribution to economic development, higher living standards, and improved health and nutrition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Good health conditions are a principal element in improved quality of life and contribute to the individual's capacity to participate in the development process, while poor health and debilitating disease can limit productivity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance for voluntary population planning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to increase the opportunities and motivation for family planning and to reduce the rate of population growth, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for voluntary population planning. In addition to the provision of family planning information and services, including also information and services which relate to and support natural family planning methods, and the conduct of directly relevant demographic research, population planning programs shall emphasize motivation for small families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance for health programs; special health needs of children and mothers; Child Survival Fund; promotion of immunization and oral rehydration; control of AIDS and tuberculosis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to contribute to improvements in the health of the greatest number of poor people in developing countries, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for health programs. Assistance under this subsection shall be used primarily for basic integrated health services, safe water and sanitation, disease prevention and control, and related health planning and research. This assistance shall emphasize self-sustaining community-based health programs by means such as training of health auxiliary and other appropriate personnel, support for the establishment and evaluation of projects that can be replicated on a broader scale, measures to improve management of health programs, and other services and supplies to support health and disease prevention programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In carrying out the purposes of this subsection, the President shall promote, encourage, and undertake activities designed to deal directly with the special health needs of children and mothers. Such activities should utilize simple, available technologies which can significantly reduce childhood mortality, such as improved and expanded immunization programs, oral rehydration to combat diarrhoeal diseases, and education programs aimed at improving nutrition and sanitation and at promoting child spacing. In carrying out this paragraph, guidance shall be sought from knowledgeable health professionals from outside the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter. In addition to government-to-government programs, activities pursuant to this paragraph should include support for appropriate activities of the types described in this paragraph which are carried out by international organizations (which may include international organizations receiving funds under part III of this subchapter) and by private and voluntary organizations, and should include encouragement to other donors to support such types of activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition to amounts otherwise available for such purpose, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 for use in carrying out this paragraph. Amounts appropriated under this subparagraph are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Appropriations pursuant to subparagraph (B) may be referred to as the &ldquo;Child Survival Fund&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the promotion of primary health care is a major objective of the foreign assistance program. The Congress further recognizes that simple, relatively low cost means already exist to reduce incidence of communicable diseases among children, mothers, and infants. The promotion of vaccines for immunization, and salts for oral rehydration, therefore, is an essential feature of the health assistance program. To this end, the Congress expects the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter to set as a goal the protection of not less than 80 percent of all children, in those countries in which such agency has established development programs, from immunizable diseases by January 1, 1991. Of the aggregate amounts made available for fiscal year 1987 to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection (relating to the Child Survival Fund) and to carry out subsection (c) of this section (relating to development assistance for health), $50,000,000 shall be used to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to other laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Assistance made available under this subsection and sections 2151b&ndash;2, 2151b&ndash;3, and 2151b&ndash;4 of this title, and assistance made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter to carry out the purposes of this subsection and the provisions cited in this paragraph, may be made available notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts assistance to foreign countries, except for the provisions of this subsection, the provisions of law cited in this paragraph, subsection (f) of this section, section 2394&ndash;1 of this title, and provisions of law that limit assistance to organizations that support or participate in a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization included under the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund heading in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108&ndash;7).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administration of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance under this part shall be administered so as to give particular attention to the <!-- PDFPage:464 -->interrelationship between (A) population growth, and (B) development and overall improvement in living standards in developing countries, and to the impact of all programs, projects, and activities on population growth. All appropriate activities proposed for financing under this part shall be designed to build motivation for smaller families through modification of economic and social conditions supportive of the desire for large families, in programs such as education in and out of school, nutrition, disease control, maternal and child health services, improvements in the status and employment of women, agricultural production, rural development, and assistance to the urban poor, and through community-based development programs which give recognition to people motivated to limit the size of their families. Population planning programs shall be coordinated with other programs aimed at reducing the infant mortality rate, providing better nutrition for pregnant women and infants, and raising the standard of living of the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Since the problems of malnutrition, disease, and rapid population growth are closely related, planning for assistance to be provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section and under section 2151a of this title shall be coordinated to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Assistance provided under this section shall emphasize low-cost integrated delivery systems for health, nutrition, and family planning for the poorest people, with particular attention to the needs of mothers and young children, using paramedical and auxiliary medical personnel, clinics and health posts, commercial distribution systems, and other modes of community outreach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Research and analysis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Health and population research and analysis carried out under this chapter shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be undertaken to the maximum extent practicable in developing countries by developing country personnel, linked as appropriate with private and governmental biomedical research facilities within the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) take account of the special needs of the poor people of developing countries in the determination of research priorities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make extensive use of field testing to adapt basic research to local conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to study the complex factors affecting population growth in developing countries and to identify factors which might motivate people to plan family size or to space their children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on use of funds for performance or research respecting abortions or involuntary sterilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilizations as a method of family planning or to coerce or provide any financial incentive to any person to undergo sterilizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for any biomedical research which relates, in whole or in part, to methods of, or the performance of, abortions or involuntary sterilization as a means of family planning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $205,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $180,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds appropriated under this subsection are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;264, title II, &sect;202, Aug. 19, 2000, 114 Stat. 758, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States and the Western World.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in the developing world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the World Health Organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of tuberculosis-related illnesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) one-third of the world's total population is infected with tuberculosis; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:466 --><p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of children becoming orphans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, its international persistence and growth pose a direct public health threat to those nations that had previously largely controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the United States attributable to foreign-born persons, tuberculosis will never be controlled in the United States until it is controlled abroad.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by several barriers, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in screening, detecting, and treating the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the unique circumstances in each country, which requires the development and implementation of country-specific programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the risk of having a bad tuberculosis program, which is worse than having no tuberculosis program because it would significantly increase the risk of the development of more widespread drug-resistant strains of the disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by the disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Between 1970 and 1997, the malaria infection rate in the United States increased by about 40 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Malaria is caused by a single-cell parasite that is spread to humans by mosquitoes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) No vaccine is available and treatment is hampered by development of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Congress recognizes the growing international problem of tuberculosis and the impact its continued existence has on those countries that had previously largely controlled the disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Congress further recognizes that the means exist to control and treat tuberculosis through expanded use of the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) treatment strategy, including DOTS-Plus to address multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and adequate investment in newly created mechanisms to increase access to treatment, including the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility established in 2001 pursuant to the Amsterdam Declaration to Stop TB and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is a major objective of the foreign assistance program of the United States to control tuberculosis, including the detection of at least 70 percent of the cases of infectious tuberculosis, and the cure of at least 85 percent of the cases detected, not later than December 31, 2005, in those countries classified by the World Health Organization as among the highest tuberculosis burden, and not later than December 31, 2010, in all countries in which the United States Agency for International Development has established development programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To carry out this section and consistent with section 2151b(c) of this title, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as the President may determine, for the prevention, treatment, control, and elimination of tuberculosis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out this section, the President shall coordinate with the World Health Organization, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and other organizations with respect to the development and implementation of a comprehensive tuberculosis control program.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:470 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Priority to DOTS coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In furnishing assistance under subsection (c) of this section, the President shall give priority to activities that increase Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) coverage and treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis where needed using DOTS-Plus, including funding for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility, the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership, and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development. In order to meet the requirement of the preceding sentence, the President should ensure that not less than 75 percent of the amount made available to carry out this section for a fiscal year should be expended for antituberculosis drugs, supplies, direct patient services, and training in diagnosis and treatment for Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) coverage and treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis using DOTS-Plus, including substantially increased funding for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) DOTS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;DOTS&rdquo; or &ldquo;Directly Observed Treatment Short-course&rdquo; means the World Health Organization-recommended strategy for treating tuberculosis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) DOTS-Plus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;DOTS-Plus&rdquo; means a comprehensive tuberculosis management strategy that is built upon and works as a supplement to the standard DOTS strategy, and which takes into account specific issues (such as use of second line anti-tuberculosis drugs) that need to be addressed in areas where there is high prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development&rdquo; means the public-private partnership that brings together leaders in health, science, philanthropy, and private industry to devise new approaches to tuberculosis and to ensure that new medications are available and affordable in high tuberculosis burden countries and other affected countries.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility (GDF)&rdquo; means the new initiative of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership to increase access to high-quality tuberculosis drugs to facilitate DOTS expansion.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151d. Development of indigenous energy resources</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Congress finds that energy development and production are vital elements in the development process, that energy shortages in developing countries severely limit the development process in such countries, that two-thirds of the developing countries which import oil depend on it for at least 90 percent of the energy which their economies require, and that the dramatic increase in world oil prices since 1973 has resulted in considerable economic hardship for many developing countries. The Congress is concerned that the value and purpose of much of the assistance provided to developing countries under sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title are undermined by the inability of many developing countries to satisfy their energy requirements. Unless the energy deficit of the developing countries can be narrowed by more fully ex<!-- PDFPage:472 -->ploiting indigenous sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, and coal, scarce foreign exchange will increasingly have to be diverted to oil imports, primarily to the detriment of long-term development and economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Congress recognizes that many developing countries lack access to the financial resources and technology necessary to locate, explore, and develop indigenous energy resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Congress declares that there is potential for at least a moderate increase by 1990 in the production of energy for commercial use in the developing countries which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In addition, there is a compelling need for vigorous efforts to improve the available data on the location, scale, and commercial exploitability of potential oil, natural gas, and coal reserves in developing countries, especially those which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Congress further declares that there are many benefits to be gained by the developing countries and by the United States and other developed countries through expanded efforts to expedite the location, exploration, and development of potential sources of energy in developing countries. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The world's energy supply would be increased and the fear of abrupt depletion would be lessened with new energy production. This could have a positive impact upon energy prices in international markets as well as a positive effect upon the balance of payments problems of many developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Diversification of the world's supplies of energy from fossil fuels would make all countries, developing and developed, less susceptible to supply interruptions and arbitrary production and pricing policies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Even a moderate increase in energy production in the developing countries would improve their ability to expand commercial trade, foreign investment, and technology transfer possibilities with the United States and other developed countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Assistance for the production of energy from indigenous resources, as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, would be of direct benefit to the poor in developing countries because of the overwhelming impact of imported energy costs upon the lives of the poor and their ability to participate in development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress also finds that energy production from renewable, decentralized sources and energy conservation are vital elements in the development process. Inadequate access by the poor to energy sources as well as the prospect of depleted fossil fuel reserves and higher energy prices require an enhanced effort to expand the energy resources of developing countries through greater emphasis on renewable sources. Renewable and decentralized energy technologies have particular applicability for the poor, especially in rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General assistance authority; cooperative programs in energy production and conservation; program goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to help developing countries alleviate their energy problems by improving their ability to use indigenous energy resources to produce the energy needed by their economies, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, to enable such countries to prepare for and undertake development of their energy resources. Such assistance may include data collection and analysis, the training of skilled personnel, research on and development of suitable energy sources, and pilot projects to test new methods of energy production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to furnish assistance under this part for cooperative programs with developing countries in energy production and conservation, through research on and development and use of small-scale, decentralized, renewable energy sources for rural areas carried out as integral parts of rural development efforts in accordance with section 2151a of this title. Such programs shall also be directed toward the earliest practicable development and use of energy technologies which are environmentally acceptable, require minimum capital investment, are most acceptable to and affordable by the people using them, are simple and inexpensive to use and maintain, and are transferable from one region of the world to another. Such programs may include research on and the development, demonstration, and application of suitable energy technologies (including use of wood); analysis of energy uses, needs, and resources; training and institutional development; and scientific interchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative coordination of planning and implementation of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter and the Department of Energy shall coordinate with one another, to the maximum extent possible, the planning and implementation of energy programs under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance for programs of technical cooperation and development, research, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for the following activities, to the extent that such activities are not authorized by sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) programs of technical cooperation and development, particularly the development efforts of United States private and voluntary agencies and regional and international development organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) programs of research into, and evaluation of, the process of economic development in less developed countries and areas, into the factors affecting the relative success and costs of development activities, and into the means, techniques, and such other aspects of development assistance as the President may determine in order to render such assistance of increasing value and benefit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) programs of reconstruction following natural or manmade disasters and programs of disaster preparedness, including the prediction of and contingency planning for natural disasters abroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) programs designed to help solve special development problems in the poorest countries and to make possible proper utilization of in<!-- PDFPage:473 -->frastructure and related projects funded with earlier United States assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) programs of urban development, with particular emphasis on small, labor intensive enterprises, marketing systems for small producers, and financial and other institutions which enable the urban poor to participate in the economic and social development of their country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $207,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $207,000,000 for fiscal year 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Financing cooperative projects among United States, Israel, and developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated to carry out this part, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 shall be used to finance cooperative projects among the United States, Israel, and developing countries.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that if current trends in the degradation of natural resources in developing countries continue, they will severely undermine the best efforts to meet basic human needs, to achieve sustained economic growth, and to prevent international tension and conflict. The Congress also finds that the world faces enormous, urgent, and complex problems, with respect to natural resources, which require new forms of cooperation between the United States and developing countries to prevent such problems from becoming unmanageable. It is, therefore, in the economic and security interest of the United States to provide leadership both in thoroughly reassessing policies relating to natural resources and the environment, and in cooperating extensively with developing countries in order to achieve environmentally sound development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance authority and emphasis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to address the serious problems described in subsection (a) of this section, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter for developing and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to protect and manage their environment and natural resources. Special efforts shall be made to maintain and where possible to restore the land, vegetation, water, wildlife, and other resources upon which depend economic growth and human well-being, especially of the poor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation considerations applicable to programs and projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President, in implementing programs and projects under this part and part X of this subchapter, shall take fully into account the impact of such programs and projects upon the environment and natural resources of developing countries. Subject to such procedures as the President considers appropriate, the President shall require all agencies and officials responsible for programs or projects under this part and part X of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental impact statement for any program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any country, the environment of the United States, or other aspects of the environment which the President may specify; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental assessment of any proposed program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of any foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such agencies and officials should, where appropriate, use local technical resources in preparing environmental impact statements and environmental assessments pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President may establish exceptions from the requirements of this subsection for emergency conditions and for cases in which compliance with those requirements would be seriously detrimental to the foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151p&ndash;1. Tropical forests</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Importance of forests and tree cover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In enacting section 2151a(b)(3) of this title the Congress recognized the importance of forests and tree cover to the developing countries. The Congress is particularly concerned about the continuing and accelerating alteration, destruction, and loss of tropical forests in developing countries, which pose a serious threat to development and the environment. Tropical forest destruction and loss&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) result in shortages of wood, especially wood for fuel; loss of biologically productive wetlands; siltation of lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation systems; floods; destruction of indigenous peoples; extinction of plant and animal species; reduced capacity for food production; and loss of genetic resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) can result in desertification and destabilization of the earth's climate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Properly managed tropical forests provide a sustained flow of resources essential to the economic growth of developing countries, as well as genetic resources of value to developed and developing countries alike.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The concerns expressed in subsection (a) of this section and the recommendations of the United States Interagency Task Force on Tropical Forests shall be given high priority by the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in formulating and carrying out programs and policies with respect to developing countries, including those relating to bilateral and multilateral assistance and those relating to private sector activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in seeking opportunities to coordinate public and private development and investment activities which affect forests in developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance to developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing assistance to developing countries, the President shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Place a high priority on conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which stress the importance of conserving and sustainably managing forest resources for the long-term economic benefit of those countries, as well as the irreversible losses associated with forest destruction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to deforestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and activities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which offer employment and income alternatives to those who otherwise would cause destruction and loss of forests, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which help developing countries identify and implement alternatives to colonizing forested areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the fullest extent feasible, support training programs, educational efforts, and the establishment or strengthening of institutions which increase the capacity of developing countries to formulate forest policies, engage in relevant land-use planning, and otherwise improve the management of their forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To the fullest extent feasible, help end destructive slash-and-burn agriculture by supporting stable and productive farming practices in areas already cleared or degraded and on lands which inevitably will be settled, with special emphasis on demonstrating the feasibility of agroforestry and other techniques <!-- PDFPage:485 -->which use technologies and methods suited to the local environment and traditional agricultural techniques and feature close consultation with and involvement of local people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To the fullest extent feasible, help conserve forests which have not yet been degraded, by helping to increase production on lands already cleared or degraded through support of reforestation, fuelwood, and other sustainable forestry projects and practices, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and other activities to conserve forested watersheds and rehabilitate those which have been deforested, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To the fullest extent feasible, support training, research, and other actions which lead to sustainable and more environmentally sound practices for timber harvesting, removal, and processing, including reforestation, soil conservation, and other activities to rehabilitate degraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the fullest extent feasible, support research to expand knowledge of tropical forests and identify alternatives which will prevent forest destruction, loss, or degradation, including research in agroforestry, sustainable management of natural forests, small-scale farms and gardens, small-scale animal husbandry, wider application of adopted traditional practices, and suitable crops and crop combinations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) To the fullest extent feasible, utilize the resources and abilities of all relevant United States Government agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Require that any program or project under this part significantly affecting tropical forests (including projects involving the planting of exotic plant species)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be based upon careful analysis of the alternatives available to achieve the best sustainable use of the land, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take full account of the environmental impacts of the proposed activities on biological diversity,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as provided for in the environmental procedures of the Agency for International Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Deny assistance under this part for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the procurement or use of logging equipment, unless an environmental assessment indicates that all timber harvesting operations involved will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which minimizes forest destruction and that the proposed activity will produce positive economic benefits and sustainable forest management systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) actions which significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas which contain tropical forests or introduce exotic plants or animals into such areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Deny assistance under this part for the following activities unless an environmental assessment indicates that the proposed activity will contribute significantly and directly to improving the livelihood of the rural poor and will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which supports sustainable development:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Activities which would result in the conversion of forest lands to the rearing of livestock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The construction, upgrading, or maintenance of roads (including temporary haul roads for logging or other extractive industries) which pass through relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The colonization of forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The construction of dams or other water control structures which flood relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the survival of many animal and plant species is endangered by over-hunting, by the presence of toxic chemicals in water, air and soil, and by the destruction of habitats. The Congress further finds that the extinction of animal and plant species is an irreparable loss with potentially serious environmental and economic consequences for developing and developed countries alike. Accordingly, the preservation of animal and plant species through the regulation of the hunting and trade in endangered species, through limitations on the pollution of natural ecosystems, and through the protection of wildlife habitats should be an important objective of the United States development assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Remedial measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to preserve biological diversity, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter, notwithstanding section 2420 of this title, to assist countries in protecting and maintaining wildlife habitats and in developing sound wildlife management and plant conservation programs.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional finding of importance of participation by private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the participation of rural and urban poor people in their countries&rsquo; development can be assisted and accelerated in an effective manner through an increase in activities planned and carried out by private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives. Such organizations and cooperatives, embodying the American spirit of self-help and assistance to others to improve their lives and incomes, constitute an important means of mobilizing private American financial and human resources to benefit poor people in developing countries. The Congress declares that it is in the interest of the United States that such organizations and cooperatives expand their overseas development efforts without compromising their private and independent nature. The Congress further declares that the financial resources of such organizations and cooperatives should be supplemented by the contribution of public funds for the purpose of undertaking development activities in accordance with the principles set forth in section 2151&ndash;1 of this title and, if necessary and determined on a case-by-case basis, for the purpose of sharing the cost of developing programs related to such activities. The Congress urges the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, in implementing programs authorized under subchapter I of this chapter, to draw on the resource of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives to plan and carry out development activities and to establish simplified procedures for the development and approval of programs to be carried out by such private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives as have demonstrated a capacity to undertake effective development activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of transportation charges on shipments by American National Red Cross and United States voluntary agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to further the efficient use of United States voluntary contributions for development, relief, and rehabilitation of friendly peoples, the President is authorized to use funds made available for the purposes of this part and part X of this subchapter to pay transportation charges on shipments by the American National Red Cross and by United States voluntary agencies registered with the Agency for International Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reimbursement for transportation charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursement under this section may be provided for transportation charges on shipments from United States ports, or in the case of excess or surplus property supplied by the United States from foreign ports, to ports of entry abroad or to points of entry abroad in cases (1) of landlocked countries, (2) where ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disturbances, (3) where carriers to a specified country are unavailable, or (4) where a substantial savings in costs or time can be effected by the utilization of points of entry other than ports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Arrangements with receiving country for free entry of shipments and for availability of local currency to defray transportation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where practicable, the President shall make arrangements with the receiving country for free entry of such shipments and for the making available by the country of local currencies for the purpose of defraying the transportation costs of such shipments from the port or point of entry of the receiving country to the designated shipping point of the consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuation of support for programs in countries antedating prohibitions on assistance; national interest considerations; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prohibitions on assistance to countries contained in this chapter or any other Act shall not be construed to prohibit assistance by the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter in support of programs of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives already being supported prior to the date such prohibition becomes applicable. The President shall take into consideration, in any case in which statutory prohibitions on assistance would be applicable but for this subsection, whether continuation of support for such programs is in the national interest of the United States. If the President continues such support after such date, he shall prepare and transmit, not later than one year after such date, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report setting forth the reasons for such continuation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funds for private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1989, funds in an amount not less than thirteen and one half percent of the aggregate amount appropriated for that fiscal year to carry out sections <!-- PDFPage:490 -->2151a(a), 2151b(b), 2151b(c), 2151c, 2151d, 2151s,<sup><a href="#2151u_1_target" name="2151u_1">1</a></sup> and 2292 of this title shall be made available for the activities of private and voluntary organizations, and the President shall seek to channel funds in an amount not less than 16 percent of such aggregate amount for the activities of private and voluntary organizations. Funds made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter for the activities of private and voluntary organizations may be considered in determining compliance with the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Promotion of democratic cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that, in addition to their role in social and economic development, cooperatives provide an opportunity for people to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Therefore, assistance under this part shall be provided to rural and urban cooperatives which offer large numbers of low- and middle-income people in developing countries an opportunity to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Such assistance shall be designed to encourage the adoption of self-help, private sector cooperative techniques and practices which have been successful in the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151v. Aid to relatively least developed countries</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Characterization of least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Relatively least developed countries (as determined on the basis of criteria comparable to those used for the United Nations General Assembly list of &ldquo;least developed countries&rdquo;) are characterized by extreme poverty, very limited infrastructure, and limited administrative capacity to implement basic human needs growth strategies. In such countries special measures may be necessary to insure the full effectiveness of assistance furnished under subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance on grant basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of promoting economic growth in these countries, the President is authorized and encouraged to make assistance under this part available on a grant basis to the maximum extent that is consistent with the attainment of United States development objectives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of principal and interest on prior liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress recognizes that the relatively least developed countries have virtually no access to private international capital markets. Insofar as possible, prior assistance terms should be consistent with present grant assistance terms for relatively least developed countries. Therefore, notwithstanding section 2370(r) of this title and section 321 of the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975 but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the President on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of the country for financial resources and the commitment of the country to the development objectives set forth in sections 2151 and 2151&ndash;1 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may permit a relatively least developed country to place amounts, which would otherwise be paid to the United States as payments on principal or interest on liability incurred by that country under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) into local currency accounts (in equivalent amounts of local currencies as determined by the official exchange rate for United States dollars) for use by the relatively least developed country, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, for activities which are consistent with section 2151&ndash;1 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may waive interest payments on liability incurred by a relatively least developed coun<!-- PDFPage:492 -->try under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) if the President determines that that country would be unable to use for development purposes the equivalent amounts of local currencies which could be made available under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The aggregate amount of interest waived and interest and principal paid into local currency accounts under this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed the amount approved for such purpose in an Act appropriating funds to carry out this part for that fiscal year, which amount may not exceed the amount authorized to be so approved by the annual authorizing legislation for development assistance programs. Amounts due and payable during fiscal year 1981 to the United States from relatively least developed countries on loans made under this subchapter (or any predecessor legislation) are authorized to be approved for use, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in an amount not to exceed $10,845,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In exercising the authority granted by this subsection, the President should act in concert with other creditor countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of requirement of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may on a case-by-case basis waive the requirement of section 2151h(a) of this title for financial or &ldquo;in kind&rdquo; contributions in the case of programs, projects, or activities in relatively least developed countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of time limitations on aid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 2151h(b) of this title shall not apply with respect to grants to relatively least developed countries.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that illicit narcotics cultivation is related to overall development problems and that the vast majority of all individuals employed in the cultivation of illicit <!-- PDFPage:493 -->narcotics reside in the developing countries and are among the poorest of the poor in those countries and that therefore the ultimate success of any effort to eliminate illicit narcotics production depends upon the availability of alternative economic opportunities for those individuals, upon other factors which assistance under this part could address, as well as upon direct narcotics control efforts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program planning priorities; resource utilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In planning programs of assistance under this part, and part X of this subchapter, and under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter for countries in which there is illicit narcotics cultivation, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should give priority consideration to programs which would help reduce illicit narcotics cultivation by stimulating broader development opportunities.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The American people abhor torture by any government or person. The existence of torture creates a <!-- PDFPage:498 -->climate of fear and international insecurity that affects all people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Torture is the deliberate mental and physical damage caused by governments to individuals to destroy individual personality and terrorize society. The effects of torture are long term. Those effects can last a lifetime for the survivors and affect future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) By eliminating the leadership of their opposition and frightening the general public, repressive governments often use torture as a weapon against democracy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Torture survivors remain under physical and psychological threats, especially in communities where the perpetrators are not brought to justice. In many nations, even those who treat torture survivors are threatened with reprisals, including torture, for carrying out their ethical duty to provide care. Both the survivors of torture and their treatment providers should be accorded protection from further repression.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering the United States have been victims of torture. Those claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of their applications for political asylum to minimize their insecurity and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now live in the United States. They should be provided with the rehabilitation services which would enable them to become productive members of our communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and other acts of torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers, together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect their families, the United States can help to heal the effects of torture and prevent its use around the world.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. DEFINITION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;As used in this Act, the term &lsquo;torture&rsquo; has the meaning given the term in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, and includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence by a person acting under the color of law upon another person under his custody or physical control.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Widespread corruption endangers the stability and security of societies, undermines democracy, and jeopardizes the social, political, and economic development of a society.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Corruption facilitates criminal activities, such as money laundering, hinders economic development, inflates the costs of doing business, and undermines the legitimacy of the government and public trust.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In January 1997 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution urging member states to carefully consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States was the first country to criminalize international bribery through the enactment of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 [Pub.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In May 1996 the Organization of American States (OAS) adopted the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption requiring countries to provide various forms of international cooperation and assistance to facilitate the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of acts of corruption.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Competent and independent judiciary, founded on a merit-based selection process and trained to enforce contracts and protect property rights, is critical for creating a predictable and consistent environment for transparency in legal procedures.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2152f. Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There are more than 143,000,000 orphans living&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2152f_1_target" name="2152f_1">1</a></sup> sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children have lost both parents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. The pandemic is deepening poverty in entire communities, and is jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected countries. It is estimated that 14,000,000 children have lost one or both parents to AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for human welfare, development, and political stability that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Extended families and local communities are struggling to meet the basic needs of orphans and vulnerable children by providing food, health care including treatment of children living with HIV/AIDS, education expenses, and clothing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Famines, natural disasters, chronic poverty, ongoing conflicts, and civil wars in developing countries are adversely affecting children in these countries, the vast majority of whom currently do not receive humanitarian assistance or other support from the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The United States Government administers various assistance programs for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. In order to improve targeting and programming of resources, the United States Agency for International Development should develop methods to adequately track the overall number of orphans and other vulnerable children receiving assistance, the kinds of programs for such children by sector and location, and any other such related data and analysis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The United States Agency for International Development should improve its capabilities to deliver assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries through partnerships with private volunteer organizations, including community and faith-based organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The United States Agency for International Development should be the primary United States Government agency responsible for identifying and assisting orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Providing assistance to such children is an important expression of the humanitarian concern and tradition of the people of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) AIDS</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;95, &sect;2, Nov. 8, 2005, 119 Stat. 2111, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) As of July 2004, there were more than 143,000,000 children living in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean who were identified as orphans, having lost one or both of their parents. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children were identified as double orphans, having lost both parents&mdash;the vast majority of whom died of AIDS. These children often are disadvantaged in numerous and devastating ways and most households with orphans cannot meet the basic needs of health care, food, clothing, and educational expenses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) It is estimated that 121,000,000 children worldwide do not attend school and that the majority of such children are young girls. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), orphans are less likely to be in school and more likely to be working full time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) School food programs, including take-home rations, in developing countries provide strong incentives for children to remain in school and continue their education. School food programs can reduce short-term hunger, improve cognitive functions, and enhance learning, behavior, and achievement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Financial barriers, such as school fees and other costs of education, prevent many orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries from attending school. Providing children with free primary school education, while simultaneously ensuring that adequate resources exist for teacher training and infrastructure, would help more orphans and other vulnerable children obtain a quality education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The trauma that results from the loss of a parent can trigger behavior problems of aggression or emotional withdrawal and negatively affect a child's performance in school and the child's social relations. Children living in families affected by HIV/AIDS or who have been orphaned by AIDS often face stigmatization and discrimination. Providing culturally appropriate psychosocial support to such children can assist them in successfully accepting and adjusting to their circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries routinely are denied their inheritance or encounter difficulties in claiming the land and other property which they have inherited. Even when the inheritance rights of women and children are spelled out in law, such rights are difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many countries it is difficult or impossible for a widow, even if she has young children, to claim property after the death of her husband.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating affect on children and is deepening poverty in entire communities and jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased the number of orphans worldwide and has exacerbated the poor living conditions of the world's poorest and most vulnerable children. AIDS has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. An estimated 14,000,000 orphans have lost 1 or both parents to AIDS. By 2010, it is estimated that over 25,000,000 children will have been orphaned by AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Approximately 2,500,000 children under the age of 15 worldwide have HIV/AIDS. Every day another 2,000 children under the age of 15 are infected with HIV. Without treatment, most children born with HIV can expect to die by age two, but with sustained drug treatment through childhood, the chances of long-term survival and a productive adulthood improve dramatically.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Few international development programs specifically target the treatment of children with HIV/AIDS in developing countries. Reasons for this include the perceived low priority of pediatric treatment, a lack of pediatric health care professionals, lack of expertise and experience in pediatric drug dosing and monitoring, the perceived complexity of pediatric treatment, and mistaken beliefs regarding the risks and benefits of pediatric treatment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Although a number of organizations seek to meet the needs of orphans or other vulnerable children, extended families and local communities continue to be the primary providers of support for such children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The HIV/AIDS pandemic is placing huge burdens on communities and is leaving many orphans with little support. Alternatives to traditional orphanages, such as community-based resource centers, continue to evolve in response to the massive number of orphans that has resulted from the pandemic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for political stability, human welfare, and development that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide, and this crisis requires an accelerated response from the international community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Although section 403(b) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(b)) establishes the requirement that not less than 10 percent of amounts appropriated for HIV/AIDS assistance for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2008 shall be expended for assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS, there is an urgent need to provide assistance to such children prior to 2006.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) Numerous United States and indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. Many of these organizations have submitted applications for grants to the Administrator of the United <!-- PDFPage:505 -->States Agency for International Development to provide increased levels of assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Increasing the amount of assistance that is provided by the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development through United States and indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, will provide greater protection for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) It is essential that the United States Government adopt a comprehensive approach for the provision of assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. A comprehensive approach would ensure that important services, such as basic care, psychosocial support, school food programs, increased educational opportunities and employment training and related services, the protection and promotion of inheritance rights for such children, and the treatment of orphans and other vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS, are made more accessible.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children can best be provided by a comprehensive approach of the United States Government that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) ensures that Federal agencies and the private sector coordinate efforts to prevent and eliminate duplication of efforts and waste in the provision of such assistance; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to the maximum extent possible, focuses on community-based programs that allow orphans and other vulnerable children to remain connected to the traditions and rituals of their families and communities.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Water-related diseases are a human tragedy, killing up to five million people annually, preventing millions of people from leading healthy lives, and undermining development efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A child dies an average of every 15 seconds because of lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the poorest countries in the world, one out of five children dies from a preventable, water-related disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices are directly responsible for the vast majority of diarrheal diseases which kill over two million children each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) At any given time, half of all people in the developing world are suffering from one or more of the main diseases associated with inadequate provision of water supply and sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Over 1.1 billion people, one in every six people in the world, lack access to safe drinking water.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Nearly 2.6 billion people, two in every five people in the world, lack access to basic sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Half of all schools in the world do not have access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Over the past 20 years, two billion people have gained access to safe drinking water and 600 million people have gained access to basic sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Access to safe water and sanitation and improved hygiene are significant factors in controlling the spread of disease in the developing world and positively affecting worker productivity and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Increasing access to safe water and sanitation advances efforts toward other development objectives, such as fighting poverty and hunger, promoting <!-- PDFPage:507 -->primary education and gender equality, reducing child mortality, promoting environmental stability, improving the lives of slum dwellers, and strengthening national security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Providing safe supplies of water and sanitation and hygiene improvements would save millions of lives by reducing the prevalence of water-borne diseases, water-based diseases, water-privation diseases, and water-related vector diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Because women and girls in developing countries are often the carriers of water, lack of access to safe water and sanitation disproportionately affects women and limits women's opportunities at education, livelihood, and financial independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Between 20 percent and 50 percent of existing water systems in developing countries are not operating or are operating poorly.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) In developing world water delivery systems, an average of 50 percent of all water is lost before it gets to the end-user.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Every $1 invested in safe water and sanitation would yield an economic return of between $3 and $34, depending on the region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Developing sustainable financing mechanisms, such as pooling mechanisms and revolving funds, is necessary for the long-term viability of improved water and sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) The annual level of investment needed to meet the water and sanitation needs of developing countries far exceeds the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and spending by governments of developing countries, so facilitating and attracting greater public and private investment is essential.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) Meeting the water and sanitation needs of the lowest-income developing countries will require an increase in the resources available as grants from donor countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) The long-term sustainability of improved water and sanitation services can be advanced by promoting community level action and engagement with civil society.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a)(1) Congress finds that the Government of Portugal's recognition of the right to independence of the African territories of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau marks a significant advance toward the goal of self-determination for all the peoples of Africa, without which peace on the continent is not secure.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Congress finds that progress toward independence for the Portuguese African territories will have a significant impact on the international organizations and the community of nations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Congress commends the Portuguese Government's initiatives on these fronts as evidence of a reaffirmation of that Government's support for her obligations under both the United Nations Charter and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Therefore, Congress calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to take the following actions designed to make clear United States support for a peaceful and orderly transition to independence in the Portuguese African territories:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) An official statement should be issued of United States support for the independence of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, and of our desire to have good relations with the future governments of the countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) It should be made clear to the Government of of Portugal that we view the efforts toward a peaceful and just settlement of the conflict in the African territories as consistent with Portugal's obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization partnership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The United States should encourage United Nations support for a peaceful transition to independence, negotiated settlement of all differences, and the protection of human rights of all citizens of the three territories.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States should open a dialog with potential leaders of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau and assure them of our commitment to their genuine political and economic independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The economic development needs of the three territories will be immense when independence is <!-- PDFPage:510 -->achieved. Therefore, it is urged that the United States Agency for International Development devote attention to assessing the economic situation in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau and be ready to cooperate with the future governments in providing the kind of assistance that will help make their independence viable. In addition, the United States Government should take the initiative among other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, in seeking significant contribution of development assistance for the three territories.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In light of the need of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau for skilled and educated manpower, a priority consideration should be given to expanding current United States programs of educational assistance to the territories as a timely and substantive contribution to their independence.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) [Repealed. Pub. L. 97&ndash;113, title VII, &sect;734(a)(8), Dec. 29, 1981, 95 Stat. 1560.]&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Multilateral programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that the planning and administration of development assistance by, or under the sponsorship of the United Nations, multilateral lending institutions, and other multilateral organizations may contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of that assistance through participation of other donors in the development effort, improved coordination of policies and programs, pooling of knowledge, avoidance of duplication of facilities and manpower, and greater encouragement of self-help performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regional programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further the sense of the Congress (1) that where problems or opportunities are common to two or more countries in a region, in such fields as agriculture, education, transportation, communications, power, watershed development, disease control, and establishment of development banks, these countries often can more effectively resolve such problems and exploit such opportunities by joining together in regional organizations or working together on regional programs, (2) that assistance often can be utilized more efficiently in regional programs than in separate country programs, and (3) that to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this chapter assistance under this chapter should be furnished so as to encourage less developed countries to cooperate with each other in regional development programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federal funds to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations for loans to foreign countries; increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should increase, to the extent practicable, the funds provided by the United States to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations in which the United States participates for use by such institutions and organizations in making loans to foreign countries.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 93&ndash;559, &sect;55(a), Dec. 30, 1974, 88 Stat. 1819, provided that: &ldquo;The United Nations has designated thirty-two countries as &lsquo;Most Seriously Affected&rsquo; by the current economic crisis. These are countries without the internal food production capability or the foreign exchange availability to secure food to meet their immediate food requirements. The Congress calls upon the President and Secretary of State to take the following actions designed to mobilize appropriate resources to meet the food emergency:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Review and make appropriate adjustments in the level of programming of our food and fertilizer assistance programs with the aim of increasing to the maximum extent feasible the volume of food and fertilizer available to those countries most seriously affected by current food shortages.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Call upon all traditional and potential new donors of food, fertilizer, or the means of financing these commodities to immediately increase their participation in efforts to address the emergency food needs of the developing world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Make available to these most seriously affected countries the maximum feasible volume of food commodities, with appropriate regard to the current domestic price and supply situations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Maintain regular and full consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress and report to the Congress and the Nation on steps which are being taken to help meet this food emergency. In accordance with this provision, the President shall report to the Congress on a global assessment of food needs for fiscal year 1975, specifying expected food grain deficits and currently planned programming of food assistance, and steps which are being taken to encourage other countries to increase their participation in food assistance or the financing of food assistance. Such report should reach the Congress promptly and should be supplemented quarterly for the remainder of fiscal year 1975.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Congress directs that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, not more than 30 percent of concessional food aid should be allocated to countries other than those which are most seriously affected by current food shortages, unless the President demonstrates to the appropriate Committees of the Congress that the use of such food assistance is solely for humanitarian food purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Congress calls upon the President to proceed with the implementation of resolutions and recommendations adopted by the World Food Conference. The Congress believes that it is incumbent upon the United States to take a leading role in assisting in the development of a viable and coherent world food policy which would begin the task of alleviating widespread hunger and suffering prevalent in famine-stricken nations. The President shall report to the Congress within 120 days of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 1974] on the implementation of the resolutions and the extent to which the United States is participating in the implementation of resolutions adopted at the World Food Conference.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that shelter, including essential urban development services, is among the most fundamental of human needs. Shelter for most people in the developing countries consists largely of domestic materials assembled by local labor. While recognizing that most financing for such shelter must come from domestic resources, the Congress finds that carefully designed programs involving United States capital and expertise can increase the availability of domestic financing for improved shelter and related services for low-income people by demonstrating to local entrepreneurs and institutions that providing low-cost shelter can be financially viable. The Congress reaffirms, therefore, that the United States should continue to assist developing countries in marshalling resources for low-cost shelter. Particular attention should be given to programs which will support pilot projects for low-cost shelter or which will have a maximum demonstration impact on local institutions and national policy. The Congress declares that the long run goal of all such programs should be to develop domestic construction capabilities and to stimulate local credit institutions to make available domestic capital and other management and technological resources required for effective low-cost shelter programs and policies.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Fees; determination by President; reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fee shall be charged for each guaranty issued under section 2182 or 2182a of this title in an amount to be determined by the President.

<p class="statutory-body">The amount of $50,000,000 of fees accumulated under prior investment guaranty provisions repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, together with all fees collected in connection with guaranties issued under section 2182 of this title or under prior housing guaranty authorities, shall be available for meeting necessary administrative and operating expenses of carrying out the provisions of section 2182 of this title and administering housing guaranties heretofore authorized under this subpart and under prior housing guaranty provisions repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 (including, but not limited to expenses pertaining to personnel, supplies, and printing), subject to such limitations as may be imposed in annual appropriation Acts; for meeting management and custodial costs incurred with respect to currencies or other assets acquired under guaranties made pursuant to section 2182 of this title or heretofore pursuant to this subpart or prior Latin American and other housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969; and to pay the cost of investigating and adjusting (including costs of arbitration) claims under such guaranties; and shall be available for expenditure in discharge of liabilities under such guaranties until such time as all such property has been disposed of and all such liabilities have been discharged or have expired, or until all such fees have been expended in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Fees collected in connection with guaranties issued under section 2182a of this title shall likewise be available to meet similar expenses, costs, or liabilities incurred in connection with the programs authorized by that section. All of the foregoing fees referred to in this section together with earnings thereon and other income arising from guaranty operations under this subpart shall be held in a revolving fund account <!-- PDFPage:518 -->maintained in the Treasury of the United States. All funds in such account may be invested in obligations of the United States. Any interest or other receipts derived from such investments shall be credited to such account and may be used for the purposes cited in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priorities of funds for guaranty payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under section 2182 of this title or heretofore under this subpart or under prior Latin American or other housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, shall be paid first out of fees referred to in subsection (b) of this section (excluding amounts required for purposes other than the discharge of liabilities under guaranties) as long as such fees are available, and thereafter shall be paid out of funds, if any, realized from the sale of currencies or other assets acquired in connection with any payment made to discharge liabilities under such guaranties as long as funds are available, and finally out of funds hereafter made available pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guaranties as obligations backed by full faith and credit of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All guaranties issued under section 2182 or 2182a, or previously under section 2200 of this title or heretofore under this subpart or under prior Latin American or other housing guaranty authority repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 shall constitute obligations, in accordance with the terms of such guaranties, of the United States of America and the full faith and credit of the United States of America is hereby pledged for the full payment and performance of such obligations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Administrator may exercise the authority to borrow under this paragraph only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount borrowed under this paragraph which is outstanding at any one time may not exceed $100,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any such borrowing shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into account the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make loans under this paragraph and for such purpose may borrow on the credit of the United States in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 31 of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agency determination of maximum rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any loan investment guaranteed under section 2182 of this title, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall prescribe the maximum rate of interest allowable to the eligible investor, which maximum rate shall not exceed by more than 1 per centum the then current rate of interest applicable to housing mortgages insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The maximum allowable rate of interest under this subsection shall be prescribed by the agency as of the date the project covered by the investment is officially authorized and, prior to the execution of the contract, the agency may amend such rate at its discretion, consistent with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guaranties under prior acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Housing guaranties committed, authorized, or outstanding heretofore under this subpart or under prior housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 shall continue subject to provisions of law originally applicable thereto and fees collected hereafter with respect to such guaranties shall be available for the purposes specified in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fraud or misrepresentation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Guaranties shall be issued under section 2182 of this title only for housing projects which are coordinated with and complementary to any development assistance being furnished under part I of this subchapter and which are specifically designed to demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of particular kinds of housing or of financial or other institutional arrangements. Of the aggregate face value of housing guaranties hereafter issued under this subpart, not less than 90 per centum shall be issued for housing suitable for families with income below the median income (below the median urban income for housing in urban areas) in the country in which the housing is located.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If less than the full amount of guarantees authorized to be made available in a fiscal year pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection is issued to Israel during that fiscal year, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall extend to any subsequent fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Not later than September 1 of each year during the period in which the President is authorized to issue loan guarantees under subsection (a) of this section, beginning in fiscal year 1993, the President shall notify the appropriate congressional committees in writing of his intentions regarding the exercise of that authority for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of that year, including a statement of the total principal amount of guarantees, if any, that the President proposes to issue for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;appropriate congressional committees&rdquo; means the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:523 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Guarantees may be issued under this section only to support activities in the geographic areas which were subject to the administration of the Government of Israel before June 5, 1967.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on guarantee amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of authorized but unissued guarantees that the President is authorized to issue as specified in subsection (b) of this section shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount extended or estimated to have been extended by the Government of Israel during the previous year for activities which the President determines are inconsistent with the objectives of this section or understandings reached between the United States Government and the Government of Israel regarding the implementation of the loan program. The President shall submit a report to Congress no later than September 30 of each fiscal year during the pendency of the program specifying the amount calculated under this subsection and that will be deducted from the amount of guarantees authorized to be issued in the next fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Fees charged for the loan guarantee program under this section each year shall be an aggregate annual origination fee equal to the estimated subsidy cost of the guarantees issued under this section for that year, calculated by the Office of Management and Budget for the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]. This shall also include an amount for the administrative expenses of the Agency for International Development in administering the program under this section. All such fees shall be paid by the Government of Israel to the Government of the United States. Funds made available for Israel under part 4 of subchapter II of this chapter, may be utilized by the Government of Israel to pay such fees to the United States Government. No further appropriations of subsidy cost are needed for the loan guarantee authorized hereunder for fiscal year 1993 and the four succeeding fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The origination fee shall be payable to the United States Government on a pro rata basis as each guarantee for each loan or increment is issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authority to suspend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (<em>l</em>) and (m) of this section, the President shall determine the terms and conditions for issuing guarantees. If the President determines that these terms and conditions have been breached, the President may suspend or terminate the provision of all or part of the additional loan guarantees not yet issued under this section. Upon making such a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Procedures for suspension or termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any suspension or termination pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon making a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such a suspension or termination shall cease to be effective if Congress enacts, within 30 days of submission, a joint resolution authorizing the assistance notwithstanding the suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any such joint resolution shall be considered in the Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions under this subsection, a motion to proceed to the consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In the event that the President suspends the provision of additional loan guarantees under subsection (f) of this section and Congress does not enact a joint resolution pursuant to this subsection, the provision of additional loan guarantees under the program established by this section may be resumed only if the President determines and so reports to Congress that the reasons for the suspension have been resolved or that the resumption is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Economic context</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The effective absorption of immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia within the private sector requires large investment and economic restructuring to promote market efficiency and thereby contribute to productive employment and sustainable growth. Congress recognizes that the Government of Israel is developing an economic strategy designed to achieve these goals, and that the Government of Israel intends to adopt a comprehensive, multi-year economic strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Congress also recognizes that these policies are being designed to reduce direct involvement of the government in the economic system and to promote private enterprise, important prerequisites for economic stability and sustainable growth.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that, as agreed between the two Governments and in order to further the policies specified in subsection (h) of this section, Israel and the United States should continue to engage in consultations concerning economic and financial measures, including structural and other reforms, that Israel should undertake during the pendency of this program to enable its economy to absorb and resettle immigrants and to accommodate the increased debt burden that will result from loans guaranteed pursuant to this section. It is the sense of the Congress that these consultations on economic measures should address progress and plans in the areas of budget policies, privatiza<!-- PDFPage:524 -->tion, trade liberalization, financial and capital markets, labor markets, competition policy, and deregulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Goods and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the pendency of the loan program authorized under this section, it is anticipated that, in the context of the economic reforms undertaken pursuant to subsections (h) and (i) of this section, Israel's increased population due to its absorption of immigrants, and the liberalization by the Government of Israel of its trade policy with the United States, the amount of United States investment goods and services purchased for use in or with respect to the country of Israel will substantially increase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall report to Congress by December 31 of each fiscal year until December 31, 1999, regarding the implementation of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Applicability of certain sections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 2183 of this title shall apply to guarantees issued under subsection (a) of this section in the same manner as such section applies to guarantees issued under section 2182 of this title, except that subsections (a), (e)(1), (g), and (j) of section 2183 of this title shall not apply to such guarantees and except that, to the extent section 2183 of this title is inconsistent with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], that Act shall apply. Loans shall be guaranteed under this section without regard to sections 2181, 2182, and 2198(c) of this title. Notwithstanding section 2183(f) of this title, the interest rate for loans guaranteed under this section may include a reasonable fee to cover the costs and fees incurred by the borrower in connection with this program or financing under this section in the event the borrower elects not to finance such costs or fees out of loan principal. Guarantees once issued hereunder shall be unconditional and fully and freely transferable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each loan guarantee issued under this section shall guarantee 100 percent of the principal and interest payable on such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standard terms of any loan or increment guaranteed under this section shall be 30 years with semiannual payments of interest only over the first 10 years, and with semiannual payments of principal and interest on a level payment basis, over the last 20 years thereof, except that the guaranteed loan or any increments issued in a single transaction may include obligations having different maturities, interest rates, and payment terms if the aggregate scheduled debt service for all obligations issued in a single transaction equals the debt service for a single loan or increment of like amount having the standard terms described in this sentence. The guarantor shall not have the right to accelerate any guaranteed loan or increment or to pay any amounts in respect of the guarantees issued other than in accordance with the original payment terms of the loan. For purposes of determining the maximum principal amount of any loan or increment to be guaranteed under this section, the principal amount of each such loan or increment shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of any loan issued on a discount basis, the original issue price (excluding any transaction costs) thereof; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any loan issue&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2186_1_target" name="2186_1">1</a></sup> on an interest-bearing basis, the stated principal amount thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation, in determining whether to provide insurance, financing, or reinsurance for a project, shall especially&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) give preferential consideration to investment projects in less developed countries that have per capita incomes of $984 or less in 1986 United States dollars, and restrict its activities with respect to investment projects in less developed countries that have per capita incomes of $4,269 or more in 1986 United States dollars (other than countries designated as <!-- PDFPage:525 -->beneficiary countries under section 2702 of title 19, Ireland, and Northern Ireland); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that the project is consistent with the provisions of section 2151p of this title, section 2151p&ndash;1 of this title, and section 2151q of this title relating to the environment and natural resources of, and tropical forests and endangered species in, developing countries, and consistent with the intent of regulations issued pursuant to section 2151p of this title, section 2151p&ndash;1 of this title, and section 2151q of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out its purpose, the Corporation, utilizing broad criteria, shall undertake&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) to conduct financing, insurance, and reinsurance operations on a self-sustaining basis, taking into account in its financing operations the economic and financial soundness of projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) to utilize private credit and investment institutions and the Corporation's guaranty authority as the principal means of mobilizing capital investment funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) to broaden private participation and revolve its funds through selling its direct investments to private investors whenever it can appropriately do so on satisfactory terms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) to conduct its insurance operations with due regard to principles of risk management including efforts to share its insurance and reinsurance risks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) to the maximum degree possible consistent with its purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(1) to give preferential consideration in its investment insurance, reinsurance, and guaranty activities to investment projects sponsored by or involving United States small business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) to increase the proportion of projects sponsored by or significantly involving United States small business to at least 30 percent of all projects insured, reinsured, or guaranteed by the Corporation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(g) to foster private initiative and competition and discourage monopolistic practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(h) to further to the greatest degree possible, in a manner consistent with its goals, the balance-of-payments and employment objectives of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to conduct its activities in consonance with the activities of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter and the international trade, investment, and financial policies of the United States Government, and to seek to support those developmental projects having positive trade benefits for the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(k)(1) to decline to issue any contract of insurance or reinsurance, or any guaranty, or to enter into any agreement to provide financing for an eligible investor's proposed investment if the Corporation determines that such investment is likely to cause such investor (or the sponsor of an investment project in which such investor is involved) significantly to reduce the number of his employees in the United States production he is replacing his United States production with production from such investment which involves substantially the same product for substantially the same market as his United States production; and (2) to monitor conformance with the representations of the investor on which the Corporation relied in making the determination required by clause (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(<em>l</em>) to decline to issue any contract of insurance or reinsurance, or any guaranty, or to enter into any agreement to provide financing for an eligible investor's proposed investment if the Corporation determines that such investment is likely to cause a significant reduction in the number of employees in the United States;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Recognizing that major private investments in less developed friendly countries or <!-- PDFPage:530 -->areas are often made by enterprises in which there is multinational participation, including significant United States private participation, the Corporation may make arrangements with foreign governments (including agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions thereof) or with multilateral organizations and institutions for sharing liabilities assumed under investment insurance for such investments and may in connection therewith issue insurance to investors not otherwise eligible hereunder, except that liabilities assumed by the Corporation under the authority of this subsection shall be consistent with the purposes of this subpart and that the maximum share of liabilities so assumed shall not exceed the proportionate participation by eligible investors in the project.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 2194 of this title shall continue until September 30, 2007.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance Reserve; Guaranty Reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be established in the Treasury of the United States a noncredit account revolving fund, which shall be available for discharge of liabilities, as provided in subsection (d) of this section, until such time as all such liabilities have been discharged or have expired or until all of the fund has been expended in accordance with the provisions of this section. Such fund shall be funded by: (1) the funds heretofore available to discharge liabilities under predecessor guaranty authority (including housing guaranty authorities), less both the amount made available for housing guaranty programs pursuant to section 2183(b) of this title and the amount made available to the Corporation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; and (2) such sums as shall be appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section for such purpose. Additional amounts may thereafter be transferred to such fund pursuant to section 2196 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority of funds used to discharge liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payments made to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance issued under section 2194 of this title, under similar predecessor guaranty authority, or under section 2194b of this title shall be paid first out of the noncredit account revolving fund, as long as such fund remains available, and thereafter out of funds made available pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under section 2194(b) of this title or 2194(c) of this title shall be paid in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reserves from predecessor guaranty authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby authorized to be transferred to the Corporation at its call, for the purposes specified in section 2196 of this title, all fees and other revenues collected under predecessor guaranty authority from December 31, 1968, available as of the date of such transfer.</p>

However, no appropriations shall be made to augment the noncredit account revolving fund until the amount of funds in the noncredit account revolving fund is less than $25,000,000. Any appropriations to augment the noncredit account revolving fund shall then only be made either pursuant to specific authorization enacted after August 27, 1974, or to satisfy the full faith and credit provision of section 2197(c) of this title. In order to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance, the Corporation is authorized to issue from time to time for purchase by the Secretary of the Treasury its notes, debentures, bonds, or other obligations; but the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000. Any such obligation shall be repaid to the Treasury within one year after the date of issue of such obligation. Any such obligation shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of any obligation authorized by this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligation of the Corporation issued under this subsection, and for such purchase he may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 after August 27, 1974. The purpose for which securities may be issued under such chapter shall include any such purchase.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guaranties as obligations backed by full faith and credit of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All guaranties issued prior to July 1, 1956, all guaranties issued under sections 1872(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2197_1_target" name="2197_1">1</a></sup> and 1933(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2197_1_target" name="2197_1">1</a></sup> of this title, all guaranties heretofore issued pursuant to prior guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, and all insurance, reinsurance and guaranties issued pursuant to this subpart shall constitute obligations, in accordance with the terms of such insurance, reinsurance or guaranties, of the United States of America and the full faith and credit of the United States of America is hereby pledged for the full payment and performance of such obligations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes the humanitarian needs of disadvantaged children in Asian countries where there has been or continues to be a heavy presence of United States military and related personnel in recent years. Moreover, the Congress finds that inadequate provision has been made for the care and welfare of such disadvantaged children, particularly those fathered by the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2201_1_target" name="2201_1">1</a></sup> United States citizens.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the President is authorized to expend up to $3,000,000 of funds made available under part I of this subchapter, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, to help meet the needs of these disadvantaged children in Asia by assisting in the expansion and improvement of orphanages, hostels, day care centers, school feeding programs, and health, education, and welfare programs. Assistance provided under this section shall be furnished under the auspices of and by international organizations or private voluntary agencies operating within, and in cooperation with, the countries of Asia where these disadvantaged children reside.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Access to financial services and the development of microenterprise are vital factors in the stable growth of developing countries and in the development of free, open, and equitable international economic systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is therefore in the best interest of the United States to facilitate access to financial services and assist the development of microenterprise in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Access to financial services and the development of microenterprises can be supported by programs providing credit, savings, training, technical assistance, business development services, and other financial services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Given the relatively high percentage of populations living in rural areas of developing countries, and the combined high incidence of poverty in rural areas and growing income inequality between rural and urban markets, microenterprise programs should target both rural and urban poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Microenterprise programs have been successful and should continue to empower vulnerable women in the developing world. The Agency should work to ensure that recipients of microenterprise and microfinance development assistance under this subpart communicate and work with nongovernmental organizations and government organizations to identify and assist victims of trafficking as provided for in section 7104(a)(1) of this title and women who are victims of or susceptible to other forms of exploitation and violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Given that microenterprise programs have been successful in empowering disenfranchised groups such as women, microenterprise programs should also target populations disenfranchised due to race or ethnicity in countries where a strong relationship between poverty and race or ethnicity has been demonstrated, such as countries in Latin America.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:547 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Congress has demonstrated its support for microenterprise development assistance programs through the enactment of two comprehensive microenterprise laws:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) The Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 (title I of Public Law 106&ndash;309; 114 Stat. 1082) [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title].</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The report on the effectiveness of the United States Agency for International Development's microfinance program, prepared by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, rated the Agency in the top tier of the 17 donors in this field.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Comptroller General, in a report dated November 2003, found that the United States Agency for International Development has met some, but not all, of the key objectives of such microenterprise development assistance programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Comptroller General's report found, among other things, the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Microenterprise development assistance generally can help alleviate some impacts of poverty, improve income levels and quality of life for borrowers and provide poor individuals, workers, and their families with an important coping mechanism.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Microenterprise development assistance programs of the United States Agency for International Development have encouraged women's participation in microfinance projects and, according to data of the Agency, women have comprised two-thirds or more of the micro-loan clients in Agency-funded microenterprise projects since 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The Comptroller General's report recommends that the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development review the Agency's &lsquo;microenterprise results reporting&rsquo; system with the goal of ensuring that its annual reporting is complete and accurate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Specifically, the Administrator should review and reconsider the methodologies used for the collection, analysis, and reporting of data on annual spending targets, outreach to the very poor, sustainability of microfinance institutions, and the contribution of Agency's funding to the institutions it supports.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) should ensure that recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title do not expend an unreasonably large percentage of such assistance on administrative costs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) should not use recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title to carry out critical management functions of the Agency, including functions such as strategy development or overall management of programs in a country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) should consult with the appropriate congressional committees with respect to the implementation of title VI of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 23, 2004].&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;309, title I, &sect;102, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1079, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings and declarations:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) According to the World Bank, more than 1,200,000,000 people in the developing world, or one-fifth of the world's population, subsist on less than $1 a day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Over 32,000 of their children die each day from largely preventable malnutrition and disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads and less access to educational and economic opportunities than their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health and education, as women in particular reinvest income in their families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly women, generally lack stable employment and social safety nets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial portion of their livelihood. In Africa, over 80 percent of employment is generated in the informal sector of the self-employed poor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-employment activities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:551 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their businesses dramatically when they can access loans at reasonable interest rates.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Through the development of self-sustaining microfinance programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against hunger and poverty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6)(A) On February 2&ndash;4, 1997, a global Microcredit Summit was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a plan to expand access to credit for self-employment and other financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's poorest families, especially the women of those families, by 2005. While this scale of outreach may not be achievable in this short time-period, the realization of this goal could dramatically alter the face of global poverty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) With an average family size of five, achieving this goal will mean that the benefits of microfinance will thereby reach nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 absolute poor people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7)(A) Nongovernmental organizations, such as those that comprise the Microenterprise Coalition (such as the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh), K&ndash;REP (Kenya), and networks such as Accion International, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), and the credit union movement) are successful in lending directly to the very poor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Microfinance institutions such as BRAC (Bangladesh), BancoSol (Bolivia), SEWA Bank (India), and ACEP (Senegal) are regulated financial institutions that can raise funds directly from the local and international capital markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) Microenterprise institutions not only reduce poverty, but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Interest income on the credit portfolio is used to pay recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term sustainability of development assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Microfinance institutions leverage foreign assistance resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits to program participants.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) The development of sustainable microfinance institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize domestic savings, is a critical component to a global strategy of poverty reduction and broad-based economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) In the efforts of the United States to lead the development of a new global financial architecture, microenterprise should play a vital role. The recent shocks to international financial markets demonstrate how the financial sector can shape the destiny of nations. Microfinance can serve as a powerful tool for building a more inclusive financial sector which serves the broad majority of the world's population including the very poor and women and thus generate more social stability and prosperity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) Over the last two decades, the United States has been a global leader in promoting the global microenterprise sector, primarily through its development assistance programs at the United States Agency for International Development. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State have used their authority to promote microenterprise in the development programs of international financial institutions and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International Development launched the &lsquo;Microenterprise Initiative&rsquo; in partnership with the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, by the end of fiscal year 1996, one-half of all microenterprise resources would support programs and institutions that provide credit to the poorest, with loans under $300.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, increased investment in microfinance institutions serving the poorest will be critical.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit will require only a small increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microfinance institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) These institutions need assistance in developing their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap commercial sources of capital.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated competence in developing networks of local microfinance institutions and other assistance delivery mechanisms so that they reach large numbers of the very poor, and achieve financial sustainability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) Recognizing that the United States Agency for International Development has developed very effective partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the Agency will have fewer missions overseas to carry out its work, the Agency should place priority on investing in those nongovernmental network institutions that meet performance criteria through the central funding mechanisms of the Agency.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) By expanding and replicating successful microfinance institutions, it should be possible to create a global infrastructure to provide financial services to the world's poorest families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17)(A) The United States can provide leadership to other bilateral and multilateral development agencies as such agencies expand their support to the microenterprise sector.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The United States should seek to improve coordination among G&ndash;7 countries in the support of the microenterprise sector in order to leverage the investment of the United States with that of other donor nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Through increased support for microenterprise, especially credit for the poorest, the United States can continue to play a leadership role in the global effort to expand financial services and opportunity to 100,000,000 of the poorest families on the planet.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional objectives and findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that, in order to achieve the mutual goals among nations of ensuring food security, human health, agricultural growth, trade expansion, and the wise and sustainable use of natural resources, the United States should mobilize the capacities of the United States land-grant universities, other eligible universities, and public and private partners of universities in the United States and other countries, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a&ndash;1 of this title, for: (1) global research on problems affecting food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; (2) improved human capacity and institutional resource development for the global application of agricultural and related environmental sciences; (3) agricultural development and trade research and extension services in the United States and other countries to support the entry of rural industries into world markets; and (4) providing for the application of agricultural sciences to solving food, health, nutrition, rural income, and environmental problems, especially such problems in low-income, food deficit countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress so declares because it finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress with and through the private sector in this country and to understanding processes of economic development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with international agencies, educational and research institutions in other countries, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations worldwide, in expanding global agricultural production, processing, business and trade, to the benefit of aid recipient countries and of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that, in a world of growing populations with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger and ensure human health and child survival, but to build the basis for economic growth and trade, and the social security in which democracy and a market economy can thrive, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies and incomes to purchase food is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current incomes are lowest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that, with expanding global markets and increasing imports into many countries, including the United States, food safety and quality, as well as secure supply, have emerged as mutual concerns of all countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional and policy development therefore are prime factors in improving agricultural production, food distribution, processing, storage, and marketing abroad (as well as in the United States);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture and the broader economy of the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) that there is a need to responsibly manage the world's agricultural and natural resources for sustained productivity, health and resilience to climate variability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) that universities and public and private partners of universities need a dependable source of funding in order to increase the impact of their own investments and those of their State governments and constituencies, in order to continue and expand their efforts to advance agricultural development in cooperating countries, to translate development into economic growth and trade for the United States and cooperating countries, and to prepare future teachers, researchers, extension specialists, entrepreneurs, managers, and decisionmakers for the world economy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration for collation of components to increase world food production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the following components must be brought together in a coordinated program to increase world food and fiber production, agricultural trade, and responsible management of natural resources, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) continued efforts by the international agricultural research centers and other international research entities to provide a global network, including United States universities, for international scientific collaboration on <!-- PDFPage:557 -->crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems of worldwide importance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contract research and the implementation of collaborative research support programs and other research collaboration led by United States universities, and involving research systems in other countries focused on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems, with benefits to the United States and partner countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) broadly disseminating the benefits of global agricultural research and development including increased benefits for United States agriculturally related industries through establishment of development and trade information and service centers, for rural as well as urban communities, through extension, cooperatively with, and supportive of, existing public and private trade and development related organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilitation of participation by universities and public and private partners of universities in programs of multilateral banks and agencies which receive United States funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) expanding learning opportunities about global agriculture for students, teachers, community leaders, entrepreneurs, and the general public through international internships and exchanges, graduate assistantships, faculty positions, and other means of education and extension through long-term recurring Federal funds matched by State funds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) competitive grants through universities to United States agriculturalists and public and private partners of universities from other countries for research, institution and policy development, extension, training, and other programs for global agricultural development, trade, and responsible management of natural resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) University involvement, participation, and cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each of the program components described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide mechanisms for the universities and public and private partners of universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assist such universities and public and private partners of universities in cooperative joint efforts with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) agricultural institutions in developing nations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) regional and international agricultural research centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) multilateral banks and agencies receiving United States funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) development agencies of other countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) United States Government foreign assistance and economic cooperation programs;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) generally engage the United States university community more extensively in the agricultural research, trade, and development initiatives undertaken outside the United States, with the objectives of strengthening its capacity to carry out research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, processing, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally developing nations, and for transforming progress in global agricultural research and development into economic growth, trade, and trade benefits for aid recipient countries and United States communities and industries, and for the wise use of natural resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure that all federally funded support to universities and public and private partners of universities relating to the goals of this subpart is periodically reviewed for its performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Universities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this subpart, the term &ldquo;universities&rdquo; means those colleges or universities in each State, territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, now receiving, or which may hereafter receive, benefits under the Act of July 2, 1862 (known as the First Morrill Act) [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], or the Act of August 30, 1890 (known as the Second Morrill Act) [7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.], which are commonly known as &ldquo;land-grant&rdquo; universities; institutions now designated or which may hereafter be designated as sea-grant colleges under the Act of October 15, 1966 (known as the National Sea Grant College and Program Act) [33 U.S.C. 1121 et seq.], which are commonly known as sea-grant colleges; Native American land-grant colleges as authorized under the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301 note); and other United States colleges and universities which&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Education that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global strategy to eliminate terrorism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Education in the Middle East about the world outside that region is weak.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:570 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The United Nations has rightly equated literacy with freedom.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The international community is moving toward setting a concrete goal of reducing by half the illiteracy rate in the Middle East by 2010, through the implementation of education programs targeting women and girls and programs for adult literacy, and by other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To be effective, efforts to improve education in the Middle East must also include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) support for the provision of basic education tools, such as textbooks that translate more of the world's knowledge into local languages and local libraries to house such materials; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more vocational education in trades and business skills.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Middle East can benefit from some of the same programs to bridge the digital divide that already have been developed for other regions of the world.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) International Youth Opportunity Fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of State is authorized to establish through an existing international organization, such as the United Nations Educational, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) or other similar body, an International Youth Opportunity Fund to provide financial assistance for the improvement of public education in the Middle East and other countries of strategic interest with predominantly Muslim populations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) International participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary should seek the cooperation of the international community in establishing and generously supporting the Fund.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the building of democracy, the restoration of peace, the improvement of living conditions, and the application of equal justice under law in Central America are important to the interests of the United States and the community of American States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the interrelated issues of social and human progress, economic growth, political reform, and regional security must be effectively dealt with to assure a democratic and economically and politically secure Central America.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The achievement of democracy, respect for human rights, peace, and equitable economic growth depends primarily on the cooperation and the human and economic resources of the people and governments of Central America. The Congress recognizes that the United States can make a significant contribution to such peaceful and democratic development through a consistent and coherent policy which includes a long-term commitment of assistance. This policy should be designed to support actively&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) democracy and political reform, including opening the political process to all members of society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) full observance of internationally recognized human rights, including free elections, freedom of the press, freedom of association, and the elimination of all human rights abuses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) leadership development, including training and educational programs to improve public administration and the administration of justice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) land reform, reform in tax systems, encouragement of private enterprise and individual initiative, creation of favorable investment climates, curbing corruption where it exists, and spurring balanced trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the establishment of the rule of law and an effective judicial system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the termination of extremist violence by both the left and the right as well as vigorous action to prosecute those guilty of crimes and the prosecution to the extent possible of past offenders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The policy described in paragraph (1) should also promote equitable economic growth and development, including controlling the flight of capital and the effective use of foreign assistance and adhering to approved programs for economic stabilization and fiscal responsibility. Finally, this policy should foster dialog and negotiations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to achieve peace based upon the objectives of democratization, reduction of armament, an end to subversion, and the withdrawal of foreign military forces and advisers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to provide a security shield against violence and intimidation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the purpose of this part to establish the statutory framework and to authorize the appropriations and financing necessary to carry out the policy described in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds, therefore, that the people of the United States are willing to sustain and expand a program of economic and military assistance in Central America if the recipient countries can demonstrate progress toward and a commitment to these goals.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that participation by Central American countries in an effective forum for dialog on, and the continuous review and advancement of, Central America's political, economic, and social development would foster cooperation between the United States and Central American countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress; Central American Development Organization; establishment, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the President should enter into negotiations with the countries of Central America to establish a Central American Development Organization (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Organization&rdquo;) to help provide a continuous and coherent approach to the development of the Central American region; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the establishment of the Organization should be based upon the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Participation in the Organization should be open to the United States, other donors, and those Central American countries that commit themselves to, among other things, respecting internationally recognized human rights, building democracy, and encouraging equitable economic growth through policy reforms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Organization should be structured to include representatives from both the public and private sectors, including representatives from the labor, agriculture, and business communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Organization should meet periodically to carry out the functions described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph and should be supported by a limited professional secretariat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Organization should make recommendations affecting Central American countries on such matters as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) political, economic, and social development objectives, including the strengthening of democratic pluralism and the safeguarding of internationally recognized human rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) mobilization of resources and external assistance needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) reform of economic policies and structures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The Organization should have the capacity for monitoring country performance on recommendations issued in accordance with subparagraph (D) of this paragraph and for evaluating progress toward meeting such country objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) To the maximum extent practicable, the United States should follow the recommendations of the Organization in disbursing bilateral economic assistance for any Central American country. No more than 75 percent of such United States assistance in any fiscal year should be disbursed until the recommendations of the Organization for that fiscal year have been made final and communicated to the donor countries. The limitation on disbursements contained in the preceding sentence should apply only to recommendations made final and communicated to donor countries prior to the fourth quarter of such fiscal year. The United States representative to the Organization should urge other donor countries to similarly implement the recommendations of the Organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, or his designee, should represent the United States Government in the Organization and should carry out his functions in that capacity under the continuous supervision and general direction of the Secretary of State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Participation of President in Organization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (d)(2) of this section, the President is authorized to participate in the Organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preparation and transmission of proposal for implementation of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, under the supervision and direction of the Secretary of State, shall prepare a detailed proposal to carry out this section and shall keep the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate fully and currently informed concerning the development of this proposal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:574 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall transmit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a copy of the text of any agreement, which he proposes to sign, that would provide for the establishment of and United States participation in the Organization no less than sixty days prior to his signature.

This paragraph shall not apply with respect to a country if the President determines that its application to that country would be contrary to the national interest of the United States, except that any such determination shall not take effect until at least 15 days after the President submits written notification of that determination to the appropriate congressional committees in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications under section 2394&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multilateral assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to vote, on and after March 1 of each year, against any loan or other utilization of the funds of their respective institution to or for any major illicit drug producing country or major drug-transit country (as determined under subsection (h) of this section) or country identified pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of section 2291h(a)(8)(A) of this title, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;multilateral development bank&rdquo; means the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) What must be certified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the assistance withheld from a country pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may be obligated and expended, and the requirement of subsection (a)(2) of this section to vote against multilateral development bank assistance to a country shall not apply, if the President determines and certifies to the Congress, at the time of the submission of the report required by section 2291h(a) of this title, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during the previous year the country has cooperated fully with the United States, or has taken adequate steps on its own, to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives established by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a country that would not otherwise qualify for certification under subparagraph (A), the vital national interests of the United States require that the assistance withheld pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section be provided and that the United States not vote against multilateral development bank assistance for that country pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations regarding cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determination described in paragraph (1)(A), the President shall consider the extent to which the country has&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) taken legal and law enforcement measures to prevent and punish public corruption, especially by senior government officials, that facilitates the production, processing, or shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or that discourages the investigation or prosecution of such acts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information to be included in national interest certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President makes a certification with respect to a country pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), the President shall include in such certification&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Licit opium producing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may make a certification under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section with respect to a major illicit drug producing country, or major drug-transit country, that is a producer of licit opium only if the President determines that such country maintains licit production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand, and has taken adequate steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit cultivation and production into the illicit markets and to prevent illicit cultivation and production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Congressional review</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Denial of assistance for countries decertified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President does not make a certification under subsection (b) of this section with respect to a country or the Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving such certification, then until such time as the conditions specified in subsection (f) of this section are satisfied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds may not be obligated for United States assistance for that country, and funds previously obligated for United States assistance for that country may not be expended for the purpose of providing assistance for that country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement to vote against multilateral development bank assistance pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section shall apply with respect to that country, without regard to the date specified in that subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recertification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (e) of this section shall apply to a country described in that subsection until&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the President, at the time of submission of the report required by section 2291h(a) of this title, makes a certification under subsection (b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B) of this section with respect to that country, and the Congress does not enact a joint resolution under subsection (d) of this section disapproving the determination of the President contained in that certification; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the President, at any other time, makes the certification described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section with respect to that country, except that this paragraph applies only if either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the President also certifies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that country has undergone a fundamental change in government, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) there has been a fundamental change in the conditions that were the reason&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if he had made such a certification and the Congress enacted a joint resolution disapproving the determination contained in the certification, why the Congress enacted that joint resolution; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="note-head">Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2007</h4>
<p class="note-body">Determination of President of the United States, No. 2006&ndash;24, Sept. 15, 2006, 71 F.R. 57865, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of State</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY03 (Public Law 107&ndash;228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p class="note-body">A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report (Tab A) are justifications for the determinations on Burma and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions is vital to the national interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although President Karzai has strongly attacked narcotrafficking as the greatest threat to Afghanistan, one third of the Afghan economy remains opium-based, which contributes to widespread public corruption. The government at all levels must be held accountable to deter and eradicate poppy cultivation; remove and prosecute corrupt officials; and investigate, prosecute, or extradite narcotraffickers and those financing their activities. We are concerned that failure to act decisively now could undermine security, compromise democratic legitimacy, and imperil international support for vital assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body">My Administration is concerned with the decline in Bolivian counternarcotics cooperation since October 2005. Bolivia, the world's third largest producer of co<!-- PDFPage:601 -->caine, has undertaken policies that have allowed the expansion of coca cultivation and slowed the pace of eradication until mid-year, when it picked up. The Government of Bolivia's (GOB) policy of &ldquo;zero cocaine, but not zero coca&rdquo; has focused primarily on interdiction, to the near exclusion of its necessary complements, eradication and alternative development. However, the GOB has been supportive of interdiction initiatives and has had positive results in seizing cocaine and decommissioning rustic labs. We would encourage the GOB to refocus its efforts on eliminating excess coca, the source of cocaine. This would include eradicating at least 5,000 hectares, including in the Chapare region; eliminating the &ldquo;cato&rdquo; exemption to Bolivian law; rescinding Ministerial Resolution 112, Administrative Resolution 083, and establishing tight controls on the sale of licit coca leaf for traditional use; and implementing strong precursor chemical control measures to prevent conversion of coca to cocaine. My Administration plans to review Bolivia's performance in these specific areas within 6 months.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Government of Canada (GOC) continued to effectively curb the diversion of precursor chemicals that are required for methamphetamine production to feed U.S. illegal markets. The GOC also continued to seize laboratories that produce MDMA/Ecstasy consumed in both Canada and the United States. The principal drug concern was the continuing large-scale production of high-potency, indoor-grown marijuana for export to the United States. The United States enjoyed excellent cooperation with Canada across a broad range of law enforcement issues and shared goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Government of Ecuador (GOE) has made considerable progress in combating narcotics trafficking destined for the United States. However, a dramatic increase in the quantity of cocaine transported toward the United States using Ecuadorian-flagged ships and indications of increased illegal armed group activity along Ecuador's northern border with Colombia remain areas of serious concern. Effective cooperation and streamlined maritime operational procedures between the U.S. Coast Guard and the Ecuadorian Navy are resulting in an increase in the amount of cocaine interdicted. Building on that cooperation, we will work with Ecuador to change the circumstances that make Ecuadorian-flagged vessels and Ecuadorian citizenship so attractive to drug traffickers.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a result of the elections in Haiti, the new government now has a clear mandate from the Haitian people to bring crime, violent gangs, and drug trafficking under control. We urge the new government to strengthen and accelerate ongoing efforts to rebuild and reform Haiti's law enforcement and judicial institutions and to consult closely with the United States to define achievable and verifiable steps to accomplish these goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the Government of Nigeria continues to take substantive steps to curb official corruption, it remains a major challenge in Nigeria. We strongly encourage the government to continue to adequately fund and support the anti-corruption bodies that have been established there in order to fully address Nigeria's ongoing fight against corruption. We urge Nigeria to continue improving the effectiveness of the National Drug and Law Enforcement Agency and, in particular, improve enforcement operations at major airports/seaports and against major drug kingpins, to include targeting their financial assets. We look forward to working with Nigerian officials to increase extraditions and assisting in drug enforcement operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although there have not been any drug seizures or apprehensions of drug traffickers with a connection to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) since 2004, we remain concerned about DPRK state-directed criminal activity. The United States Government has made clear to the DPRK that an end to all involvement in criminal activity is a necessary prerequisite to entry into the international community.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under provisions of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA), which modified section 489(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and section 490(a) of the FAA, a report will be made to the Congress on March 1, 2007, naming the five countries that legally exported the largest amount of methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as the top five methamphetamine precursor importers with the highest rate of diversion for illicit drug production. This report will be sent concurrently with the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which will also contain additional reporting on methamphetamine precursor chemicals pursuant to the CMEA.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) drought and famine have caused countless deaths and untold suffering among the people of sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) drought and famine in combination with other factors such as desertification, government neglect of the agricultural sector, and inappropriate economic policies have severely affected long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the most cost-effective and efficient way of overcoming Africa's vulnerability to drought and famine is to address Africa's long-term development needs through a process that builds upon the needs and capabilities of the African people, promotes sustained and equitable economic growth, preserves the environment, and protects the rights of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority to furnish assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to furnish project and program assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine in accordance with the policies contained in this section, for long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:611 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The economic, security, and humanitarian interests of the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa would be enhanced by sustainable, broad-based agricultural and rural development in each of the African nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of undernourished people in Africa has more than doubled, from approximately 100,000,000 in the late 1960s to 215,000,000 in 1998, and is projected to increase to 265,000,000 by the year 2010. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the term &lsquo;under nutrition&rsquo; means inadequate consumption of nutrients, often adversely affecting children's physical and mental development, undermining their future as productive and creative members of their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Currently, agricultural production in Africa employs about two-thirds of the workforce but produces less than one-fourth of the gross domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank Group.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) African women produce up to 80 percent of the total food supply in Africa according to the International Food Policy Research Institute.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) An effective way to improve conditions of the poor is to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. Productivity increases can be fostered by increasing research and education in agriculture and rural development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In November 1996, the World Food Summit set a goal of reducing hunger worldwide by 50 percent by the year 2015 and encouraged national governments to develop domestic food plans and to support international aid efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Although the World Bank Group recently has launched a major initiative to support agricultural and rural development, only 10 percent, or $1,200,000,000, of its total lending to sub-Saharan Africa for fiscal years 1993 to 1997 was devoted to agriculture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) United States food processing and agricultural sectors benefit greatly from the liberalization of global trade and increased exports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Africa represents a growing market for United States food and agricultural products. Africa's food imports are projected to rise from less than 8,000,000 metric tons in 1990 to more than 25,000,000 metric tons by the [sic] 2020.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9)(A) Increased private sector investment in African countries and expanded trade between the United States and Africa can greatly help African countries achieve food self-sufficiency and graduate from dependency on international assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Development assistance, technical assistance, and training can facilitate and encourage commercial development in Africa, such as improving rural roads, agricultural research and extension, and providing access to credit and other resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) Several United States private voluntary organizations have demonstrated success in empowering Africans through direct business ownership and helping African agricultural producers more efficiently and directly market their products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Rural business associations, owned and controlled by farmer shareholders, also greatly help agricultural producers to increase their household incomes.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Declaration of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States, consistent with title XII of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [probably means title XII of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. 2220a et seq.], to support governments of sub-Saharan African countries, United States and African nongovernmental organizations, universities, businesses, and international agencies, to help ensure the availability of basic nutrition and economic opportunities for individuals in sub-Saharan Africa, through sustainable agriculture and rural development.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;246, &sect;2, Oct. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 1511, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the leadership of the Russian Federation has publicly committed itself to building&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a society with democratic political institutions and practices, the observance of universally recognized standards of human rights, and religious and press freedom; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) a market economy based on internationally accepted principles of transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In order to facilitate this transition, the international community has provided multilateral and bilateral technical assistance, and the United States&rsquo; contribution to these efforts has played an important role in developing new institutions built on democratic and liberal economic foundations and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3)(A) Since 1992, United States Government democratic reform programs and public diplomacy programs, including training, and small grants have provided access to and training in the use of the Internet, brought nearly 40,000 Russian citizens to the United States, and have led to the establishment of more than 65,000 nongovernmental organizations, thousands of independent local media outlets, despite governmental opposition, and numerous political parties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) These efforts contributed to the substantially free and fair Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1999.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States has assisted Russian efforts to replace its centrally planned, state-controlled economy with a market economy and helped create institutions and infrastructure for a market economy. Approximately two-thirds of the Russian Federation's gross domestic product is now generated by the private sector, and the United States recognized Russia as a market economy on June 7, 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) The United States has fostered grassroots entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation by focusing United States economic assistance on small- and medium-sized businesses and by providing training, consulting services, and small loans to more than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) There are now more than 900,000 small businesses in the Russian Federation, producing 12 to 15 percent, depending on the estimate, of the gross domestic product of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) United States-funded programs have contributed to fighting corruption and financial crime, such as money laundering, by helping to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(i) establish a commercial legal infrastructure;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) develop an independent judiciary;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(iii) support the drafting of a new criminal code, civil code, and bankruptcy law;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(iv) develop a legal and regulatory framework for the Russian Federation's equivalent of the <!-- PDFPage:615 -->United States Securities and Exchange Commission;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(v) support Russian law schools;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(vi) create legal aid clinics; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(vii) bolster law-related activities of nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Because the capability of Russian democratic forces and the civil society to organize and defend democratic gains without international support is uncertain, and because the gradual integration of the Russian Federation into the global order of free-market, democratic nations would enhance Russian cooperation with the United States on a wide range of political, economic, and security issues, the success of democracy in Russia is in the national security interest of the United States, and the United States Government should develop a far-reaching and flexible strategy aimed at strengthening Russian society's support for democracy and a market economy, particularly by enhancing Russian democratic institutions and education, promoting the rule of law, and supporting Russia's independent media.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Russian Federation has stood with the United States and the rest of the civilized world in the struggle against terrorism and has cooperated in the war in Afghanistan by sharing intelligence and through other means.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) United States-Russia relations have improved, leading to a successful summit between President Bush and President Putin in May 2002, resulting in a &lsquo;Foundation for Cooperation&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to strengthen and advance institutions of democratic government and of free and independent media, and to sustain the development of an independent civil society in the Russian Federation based on religious and ethnic tolerance, internationally recognized human rights, and an internationally recognized rule of law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to focus United States foreign assistance programs on using local expertise and to give local organizations a greater role in designing and implementing such programs, while maintaining appropriate oversight and monitoring.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2301. Congressional statement of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress of the United States reaffirms the policy of the United States to achieve international peace and security through the United Nations so that armed force shall not be used except for individual or collective self-defense. The Congress finds that the efforts of the United States and other friendly countries to promote <!-- PDFPage:623 -->peace and security continue to require measures of support based upon the principle of effective self-help and mutual aid. It is the purpose of subchapter II of this chapter to authorize measures in the common defense against internal and external aggression, including the furnishing of military assistance, upon request, to friendly countries and international organizations. In furnishing such military assistance, it remains the policy of the United States to continue to exert maximum efforts to achieve universal control of weapons of mass destruction and universal regulation and reduction of armaments, including armed forces, under adequate safeguards to protect complying countries against violation and evasion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that the peace of the world and the security of the United States are endangered so long as hostile countries continue by threat of military action, by the use of economic pressure, and by internal subversion, or other means to attempt to bring under their domination peoples now free and independent and continue to deny the rights of freedom and self-government to peoples and countries once free but now subject to such domination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that an important contribution toward peace would be made by the establishment under the Organization of American States of an international military force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In enacting this legislation, it is therefore the intention of the Congress to promote the peace of the world and the foreign policy, security, and general welfare of the United States by fostering an improved climate of political independence and individual liberty, improving the ability of friendly countries and international organizations to deter or, if necessary, defeat aggression, facilitating arrangements for individual and collective security, assisting friendly countries to maintain internal security, and creating an environment of security and stability in the developing friendly countries essential to their more rapid social, economic, and political progress. The Congress urges that all other countries able to contribute join in a common undertaking to meet the goals stated in subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that in the administration of subchapter II of this chapter priority shall be given to the needs of those countries in danger of becoming victims of aggression or in which the internal security is threatened by internal subversion inspired or supported by hostile countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Finally, the Congress reaffirms its full support of the progress of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization toward increased cooperation in political, military, and economic affairs. In particular, the Congress welcomes the steps which have been taken to promote multilateral programs of coordinated procurement, research, development, and production of defense articles and urges that such programs be expanded to the fullest extent possible to further the defense of the North Atlantic Area.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Observance of human rights as principal goal of foreign policy; implementation requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The United States shall, in accordance with its international obligations as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in keeping with the constitutional heritage and traditions of the United States, promote and encourage increased respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion. Accordingly, a principal goal of the foreign policy of the United States shall be to promote the increased observance of internationally recognized human rights by all countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except under circumstances specified in this section, no security assistance may be provided to any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. Security assistance may not be provided to the police, domestic intelligence, or similar law enforcement forces of a country, and licenses may not be issued under the Export Administration Act of 1979 [50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.] for the export of crime control and detection instruments and equipment to a country, the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights unless the President certifies in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate (when licenses are to be issued pursuant to the Export Administration Act of 1979).<sup><a href="#2304_1_target" name="2304_1">1</a></sup> that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting provision of such assistance and issuance of such licenses. Assistance may not be provided under part V of this subchapter to a country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights unless the President certifies in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that extraordinary cir<!-- PDFPage:625 -->cumstances exist warranting provision of such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In furtherance of paragraphs (1) and (2), the President is directed to formulate and conduct international security assistance programs of the United States in a manner which will promote and advance human rights and avoid identification of the United States, through such programs, with governments which deny to their people internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, in violation of international law or in contravention of the policy of the United States as expressed in this section or otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining whether the government of a country engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, the President shall give particular consideration to whether the government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom, as defined in section 6402 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has failed to undertake serious and sustained efforts to combat particularly severe violations of religious freedom when such efforts could have been reasonably undertaken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report by Secretary of State on practices of proposed recipient countries; considerations</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2351. Encouragement of free enterprise and private participation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress of the United States recognizes the vital role of free enterprise in achieving rising levels of production and standards of living essential to economic progress and development. Accordingly, it is declared to be the policy of the United States to encourage the efforts of other countries to increase the flow of international trade, to foster private initiative and competition, to encourage the development and use of cooperatives, credit unions, and savings and loan associations, to discourage monopolistic practices, to improve the technical efficiency of their industry, agriculture, and commerce, and to strengthen free labor unions; and to encourage the contribution of United States enterprise toward economic strength of less developed friendly countries, through private trade and investment abroad, private participation in programs carried out under this chapter (including the use of private trade channels to the maximum extent practicable in carrying out such programs), and exchange of ideas and technical information on the matters covered by this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Action by President to facilitate participation to maximum extent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage and facilitate participation by private enterprise to the maximum extent practicable in achieving any of the purposes of this chapter, the President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make arrangements to find, and draw the attention of private enterprise to, opportunities for investment and development in less-developed friendly countries and areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish an effective system for obtaining adequate information with respect to the <!-- PDFPage:668 -->activities of, and opportunities for, nongovernmental participation in the development process, and for utilizing such information in the planning, direction, and execution of programs carried out under this chapter, and in the coordination of such programs with the ever-increasing developmental activities of nongovernmental United States institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) accelerate a program of negotiating treaties for commerce and trade, including tax treaties, which shall include provisions to encourage and facilitate the flow of private investment to, and its equitable treatment in, friendly countries and areas participating in programs under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) seek, consistent with the national interest, compliance by other countries or areas with all treaties for commerce and trade and taxes, and take all reasonable measures under this chapter or other authority to secure compliance therewith and to assist United States citizens in obtaining just compensation for losses sustained by them or payments exacted from them as a result of measures taken or imposed by any country or area thereof in violation of any such treaty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the maximum extent practicable carry out programs of assistance through private channels and to the extent practicable in conjunction with local private or governmental participation, including loans under the authority of section 2151t of this title to any individual, corporation, or other body of persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) take appropriate steps to discourage nationalization, expropriation, confiscation, seizure of ownership or control, of private investment and discriminatory or other actions having the effect thereof, undertaken by countries receiving assistance under this chapter, which divert available resources essential to create new wealth, employment, and productivity in those countries and otherwise impair the climate for new private investment essential to the stable economic growth and development of those countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) utilize wherever practicable the services of United States private enterprise (including, but not limited to, the services of experts and consultants in technical fields such as engineering); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) utilize wherever practicable the services of United States private enterprise on a cost-plus incentive fee contract basis to provide the necessary skills to develop and operate a specific project or program of assistance in a less developed friendly country or area in any case in which direct private investment is not readily encouraged, and provide where appropriate for the transfer of equity ownership in such project or program to private investors at the earliest feasible time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) International Private Investment Advisory Council on Foreign Aid; establishment; composition; selection of members by Administrator; duration of service; Chairman; duties of Council; compensation; travel and other expenses; funds for payment of expenses of Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is hereby established an International Private Investment Advisory Council on Foreign Aid to be composed of such number of leading American business specialists as may be selected, from time to time, by the Administrator of the Agency for International Development for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this subsection. The members of the Council shall serve at the pleasure of the Administrator, who shall designate one member to serve as Chairman.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It shall be the duty of the Council, at the request of the Administrator, to make recommendations to the Administrator with respect to particular aspects of programs and activities under this chapter where private enterprise can play a contributing role and to act as liaison for the Administrator to involve specific private enterprises in such programs and activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The members of the Advisory Council shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be entitled to reimbursement in accordance with section 5703 of title 5 for travel and other expenses incurred by them in the performance of their functions under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The expenses of the Advisory Council shall be paid by the Administrator from funds otherwise available under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Engineering and professional services of United States firms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that the Agency for International Development should continue to encourage, to the maximum extent consistent with the national interest, the utilization of engineering and professional services of United States firms (including, but not limited to, any corporation, company, partnership, or other association) or by an affiliate of such United States firms in connection with capital projects financed by funds authorized under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contracts on basis of competitive selection procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that significantly greater effort must be made in carrying out programs under subchapter I of this chapter to award contracts on the basis of competitive selection procedures. All such contracts should be let on the basis of competitive selection procedures except in those limited cases in which the procurement regulations governing the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter allow noncompetitive procedures to be used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Repealed. Pub. L. 97&ndash;113, title VII, &sect;734(a)(1), Dec. 29, 1981, 95 Stat. 1560.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, in connection with the furnishing of assistance under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an invention or discovery covered by a patent issued by the United States Government is practiced within the United States without the authorization of the owner, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the exclusive remedy of the owner, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, is to sue the United States Government for reasonable and entire compensation for such practice or disclosure in the district court of the United States for the district in which such owner is a resident, or in the United States Court of Federal Claims, within six years after the cause of action arises. Any period during which the United States Government is in possession of a written claim under subsection (b) of this section before mailing a notice of denial of that claim does not count in computing the six years. In any such suit, the United States Government may plead any defense that may be pleaded by a private person in such an action. The last paragraph of section 1498(a) of title 28 shall apply to inventions and information covered by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Settlement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before suit against the United States Government has been instituted, the head of the agency of the United States Government concerned may settle and pay any claim arising under the circumstances described in subsection (a) of this section. No claim may be paid under this subsection unless the amount tendered is accepted by the claimant in full satisfaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Drug products manufactured outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds appropriated pursuant to this chapter shall not be expended by the United States Government for the acquisition of any drug product or pharmaceutical product manufactured outside the United States if the manufacture of such drug product or pharmaceutical product in the United States would involve the use of, or be covered by, an unexpired patent of the United States which has not previously been held invalid by an unappealed or unappealable judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, unless such manufacture is expressly authorized by the owner of such patent.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Advance-of-funds or reimbursement basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President determines it to be consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes of subchapter I of this chapter and within the limitations of this chapter, any agency of the United States Government is authorized to furnish services and commodities on an advance-of-funds or reimbursement basis to friendly countries, international organizations, the American Red Cross, and voluntary nonprofit relief agencies registered with and approved by the Agency for International Development (including foreign voluntary nonprofit relief agencies so registered and approved when no United States voluntary nonprofit relief agency is available). Such advances or reimbursements may be credited to the currently applicable appropriation, account, or fund of the agency concerned and shall be available for the purposes for which such appropriation, account, or fund is authorized to be used, under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Advances or reimbursements which are received under this section within one hundred and eighty days after the close of the fiscal year in which such services and commodities are delivered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Advances or reimbursements received pursuant to agreements executed under this section in which reimbursement will not be completed within one hundred and eighty days after the close of the fiscal year in which such services and commodities are delivered: <em>Provided</em>, That such agreements require the payment of interest at the current rate established pursuant to section 635(b)(1)(B) of title 12, and repayment of such principal and interest does not exceed a period of three years from the date of signing of the agreement to provide the service: <em>Provided further</em>, That funds available for this paragraph in any fiscal year shall not exceed $1,000,000 of the total funds authorized for use in such fiscal year by part I of subchapter I of this chapter, and shall be available only to the extent provided in appropriation Acts. Interest shall accrue as of the date of disbursement to the agency or organization providing such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agency contracts with individuals to perform services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When any agency of the United States Government provides services on an advance-of-funds or reimbursable basis under this section, such agency may contract with individuals for personal service abroad or in the United States to perform such services or to replace officers or employees of the United States Government who are assigned by the agency to provide such services. Such individuals shall not be regarded as employees of the United States Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Excess property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, no Government-owned excess property shall be made available under this section, section 2358 of this title, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of subchapter I of this chapter, unless, before the shipment of such property for use in a specified country (or transfer, if the property is already in such country), the agency administering such subchapter I has approved such shipment (or transfer) and made a written determination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that there is a need for such property in the quantity requested and that such property is suitable for the purpose requested;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as to the status and responsibility of the designated end-user and his ability effectively to use and maintain such property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that the residual value, serviceability, and appearance of such property would not reflect unfavorably on the image of the United States and would justify the costs of packing, crating, handling, transportation, and other accessorial costs, and that the residual value at least equals the total of these costs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of transferring property described in this subsection in furtherance of the provisions of part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter, the phrase &ldquo;the agency administering such subchapter I&rdquo; shall be considered to refer to the Department of State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of Government-owned excess property to enhance environmental protection in foreign countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State, acting through the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, is authorized to transfer to any friendly country, international organization, the American Red Cross, or other voluntary nonprofit relief agency described in subsection (a) of this section, Government-owned excess property made available under this section or section 2358 of this title in order to support activities carried out under subchapter I of this chapter which are designed to enhance environmental protection in foreign countries if the Secretary of State makes a written determination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that there is a need for such property in the quantity requested and that such property is suitable for the purpose requested;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as to the status and responsibility of the designated end-user and his ability effectively to use and maintain such property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that the residual value, serviceability, and appearance of such property would not reflect unfavorably on the image of the United States and would justify the costs of packing, crating, handling, transportation, and other accessorial costs, and that the residual value at least equals the total of these costs.</p>

No such program shall be assisted unless the President has received assurances that in the administration of such program the recipient will take reasonable precautions to insure that no person receives any family planning assistance or supplies unless he desires such services. The excess foreign currencies made available under this subsection shall not, in any one year, exceed 5 per centum of the aggregate of all excess foreign currencies. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;voluntary family planning program&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, demographic studies, medical and psychological research, personnel training, the construction and staffing of clinics and rural health centers, specialized training of doctors and paramedical personnel, the manufacture of medical supplies, and the dissemination of family planning information, medical assistance, and supplies to individuals who desire such assistance.</p>

It is the sense of the Congress that when consideration is given to authorizing assistance to a country removed from the application of this subsection, one of the factors to be weighed, among others, is whether the country in question is giving evidence of fostering the establishment of a genuinely democratic system, with respect for internationally recognized human rights.</p>

This prohibition shall not apply to monetary assistance made available for use by a government (or a political subdivision or agency of a government) to compensate nationals of that country in accordance with a land reform program, if the President determines that monetary assistance for such land reform program will further the national interests of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Regulations and procedures to insure aid is not used contrary to the best interests of the United States</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration and statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the achievement of a just and lasting Cyprus settlement is and will remain a central objective of United States foreign policy. The Congress further declares that any action of the United States with respect to section 2370(x)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2373_1_target" name="2373_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall not signify a lessening of the United States commitment to a just solution to the conflict on Cyprus but is authorized in the expectation that this action will be conducive to achievement of a Cyprus solution and a general improvement in relations among Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus and between those countries and the United States. The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a just settlement on Cyprus must involve the establishment of a free and independent government on Cyprus and must guarantee that the human rights of all of the people of Cyprus are fully protected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a just settlement on Cyprus must include the withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the guidelines for inter-communal talks agreed to in Nicosia in February 1977 and the United Nations resolutions regarding Cyprus provide a sound basis for negotiation of a just settlement on Cyprus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) serious negotiations, under United Nations auspices, will be necessary to achieve agreement on, and implementation of, constitutional and territorial terms within such guidelines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the recent proposals by both Cypriot communities regarding the return of the refugees to the city of New Famagusta (Varosha) constitute a positive step and the United States should actively support the efforts of the Secretary General of the United Nations with respect to this issue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Governing principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">United States policy regarding Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey shall be directed toward the <!-- PDFPage:698 -->restoration of a stable and peaceful atmosphere in the Eastern Mediterranean region and shall therefore be governed by the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States shall actively support the resolution of differences through negotiations and internationally established peaceful procedures, shall encourage all parties to avoid provocative actions, and shall strongly oppose any attempt to resolve disputes through force or threat of force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The United States will accord full support and high priority to efforts, particularly those of the United Nations, to bring about a prompt, peaceful settlement on Cyprus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) All defense articles furnished by the United States to countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region will be used only in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.], and the agreements under which those defense articles were furnished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States will furnish security assistance for Greece and Turkey only when furnishing that assistance is intended solely for defensive purposes, including when necessary to enable the recipient country to fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and shall be designed to ensure that the present balance of military strength among countries of the region, including between Greece and Turkey, is preserved. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of defense articles to Greece or Turkey for legitimate self defense or to enable Greece or Turkey to fulfill their North Atlantic Treaty Organization obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The United States shall use its influence to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire on Cyprus until an equitable negotiated settlement is reached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The United States shall use its influence to achieve the withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus in the context of a solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of policy; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Because progress toward a Cyprus settlement is a high priority of United States policy in the Eastern Mediterranean, the President and the Congress shall continually review that progress and shall determine United States policy in the region accordingly. To facilitate such a review the President shall, within 60 days after the date of enactment of this section and at the end of each succeeding 60-day period, transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on progress made toward the conclusion of a negotiated solution of the Cyprus problem. Such transmissions shall include any relevant reports prepared by the Secretary General of the United Nations for the Security Council.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certification by President to Congress of assistance to Greece and Turkey</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to ensure that United States assistance is furnished consistent with the policies established in this section, the President shall, whenever requesting any funds for security assistance under this chapter or the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] for Greece and Turkey, transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate his certification, with a full explanation thereof, that the furnishing of such assistance will be consistent with the principles set forth in subsection (b). The President shall also submit such a certification with any notification to the Congress, pursuant to section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2776(b)], of a proposed sale of defense articles or services to Greece or Turkey.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Arms sales agreements to prohibit transfer to Cyprus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any agreement for the sale or provision of any article on the United States Munitions List (established pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2778]) entered into by the United States after December 22, 1987, shall expressly state that the article is being provided by the United States only with the understanding that it will not be transferred to Cyprus or otherwise used to further the severance or division of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall report to Congress any substantial evidence that equipment provided under any such agreement has been used in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2375. Assistance to Pakistan</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional policy, findings, and goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan pose a security threat to Pakistan. The Congress also recognizes that an independent and democratic Pakistan with continued friendly ties with the United States is in the interest of both nations. The Congress finds that United States assistance will help Pakistan maintain its independence. Assistance to Pakistan is intended to benefit the people of Pakistan by helping them meet the burdens imposed by the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan and by promoting economic development. In authorizing assistance to Pakistan, it is the intent of Congress to promote the expeditious restoration of full civil liberties and representative government in Pakistan. The Congress further recognizes that it is in the mutual interest of Pakistan and the United States to avoid the profoundly destabilizing effects of the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices or the capacity to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear devices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reaffirmation of 1959 bilateral agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States reaffirms the commitment made in its 1959 bilateral agreement with Pakistan relating to aggression from a Communist or Communist-dominated state.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Availability; defensive aspects of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Security assistance for Pakistan shall be made available in order to assist Pakistan in dealing with the threat to its security posed by the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. The United States will take appropriate steps to ensure that defense articles provided by the United States to Pakistan are used for defensive purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of limitations respecting nuclear transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may waive the prohibitions of section 2799aa of this title with respect to any grounds for the prohibition of assistance under that section arising before the effective date of part B of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 to provide assistance to Pakistan if he determines that to do so is in the national interest of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nuclear non-proliferation conditions on military assistance; exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No military assistance shall be furnished to Pakistan and no military equipment or technology shall be sold or transferred to Pakistan, pursuant to the authorities contained in this chapter or any other Act, unless the President shall have certified in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, during the fiscal year in which military assistance is to be furnished or military equipment or technology is to be sold or transferred, that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the proposed United States military assistance program will reduce significantly the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear explosive device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The prohibitions in this section do not apply to any assistance or transfer provided for the purposes of:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:700 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) International narcotics control (including part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter) or any provision of law available for providing assistance for counternarcotics purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Facilitating military-to-military contact, training (including part V of subchapter II of this chapter) and humanitarian and civic assistance projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Peacekeeping and other multilateral operations (including part VI of subchapter II of this chapter relating to peacekeeping) or any provision of law available for providing assistance for peacekeeping purposes, except that lethal military equipment provided under this subparagraph shall be provided on a lease or loan basis only and shall be returned upon completion of the operation for which it was provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Antiterrorism assistance (including part VIII of subchapter II of this chapter relating to antiterrorism assistance) or any provision of law available for antiterrorism assistance purposes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The restrictions of this subsection shall continue to apply to contracts for the delivery of F&ndash;16 aircraft to Pakistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in this subsection, military equipment, technology, or defense services, other than F&ndash;16 aircraft, may be transferred to Pakistan pursuant to contracts or cases entered into before October 1, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Storage costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may release the Government of Pakistan of its contractual obligation to pay the United States Government for the storage costs of items purchased prior to October 1, 1990, but not delivered by the United States Government pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and may reimburse the Government of Pakistan for any such amount paid, on such terms and conditions as the President may prescribe: <em>Provided</em>, That such payments have no budgetary impact.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Inapplicability of restrictions to previously owned items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (e) of this section does not apply to broken, worn or unupgraded items or their equivalent which Pakistan paid for and took possession of prior to October 1, 1990 and which the Government of Pakistan sent to the United States for repair or upgrade. Such equipment or its equivalent may be returned to the Government of Pakistan: <em>Provided</em>, That the President determines and so certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that such equipment or equivalent neither constitutes nor has received any significant qualitative upgrade since being transferred to the United States and that its total value does not exceed $25,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Ballistic missile sanctions not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained herein shall affect sanctions for transfers of missile equipment or technology required under section 2410b of title 50, Appendix, or section 2797b of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2376. Nuclear non-proliferation policy in South Asia</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and stability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) South Asia, in particular, is an area where the threat of a regional nuclear exchange remains high due to continued Indo-Pakistani tensions over issues such as Kashmir;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to date, United States efforts to halt proliferation in South Asia have failed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) although global disarmament is a desirable goal which should be vigorously pursued, both regional and sub-regional security arrangements can serve to decrease tensions and promote non-proliferation in certain areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) thus far, there has been some success on a regional basis, such as the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone and the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in particular, in Latin America, the Treaty of Tlatelolco has been signed by all the nuclear powers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a critical part of this treaty is Protocol II which prohibits nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on signatories to the treaty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in 1991, a proposal was made for a regional conference on non-proliferation in South Asia which would include Pakistan, India, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) thus far, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States have expressed interest in attending such a conference, whereas India has refused to attend.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should pursue a policy which seeks a regional negotiated solution to the issue of nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia at the earliest possible time, including a protocol to be signed by all nuclear weapons states, prohibiting nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on countries in the region. Such a policy should have as its ultimate goal concurrent accession by Pakistan and India to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and should also include as needed a phased approach to that goal through a series of agreements among the parties on nuclear issues, such as the agreement reached by Pakistan and India not to attack one another's nuclear facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report on progress toward regional non-proliferation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than April 1 of each year, the President shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, on nuclear proliferation in South Asia, including efforts taken by the United States to achieve a regional agreement on nuclear non-proliferation, and including a comprehensive list of the obstacles to concluding such a regional agreement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Delegation by President; rules and regulations; utilization of goods and services from private enterprise, and facilities and resources of Federal agencies when not competitive with private enterprise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may exercise any functions conferred upon him by this chapter through such agency or officer of the United States Government as he shall direct. The head of any such agency or such officer may from time to time promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out such functions, and may delegate authority to perform any such functions, including, if he shall so specify, the authority successively to redelegate any of such functions to any of his subordinates. In providing technical assistance under this chapter, the head of any such agency or such officer shall utilize, to the fullest extent practicable, goods and professional and other services from private enterprise on a contract basis. In such fields as education, health, housing, or agriculture, the facilities and resources of other Federal agencies shall be utilized when such facilities are particularly or uniquely suitable for technical assistance, are not competitive with private enterprise, and can be made available without interfering unduly with domestic programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:708 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility of suppliers; debarment period; causes for debarment; conditions for reinstatement; periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall issue and enforce regulations determining the eligibility of any person to receive funds made available under this chapter. A person may be suspended under such regulations for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation and any resulting judicial or debarment proceedings, upon cause for belief that such person or an affiliate thereof probably has undertaken conduct which constitutes a cause for debarment; and, after an opportunity has been afforded to such person for a hearing, he may be debarred for an additional period, not to exceed three years. Among the causes for debarment shall be (1) offering or accepting a bribe or other illegal payment or credit in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (2) committing a fraud in the procurement or performance of any contract financed with funds made available under this chapter; or (3) acting in any other manner which shows a lack of integrity or honesty in connection with any transaction financed with funds made available under this chapter. Reinstatement of eligibility in each particular case shall be subject to such conditions as the President shall direct. Each person whose eligibility is denied or suspended under this subsection shall, upon request, be entitled to a review of his eligibility not less often than once every two years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;HELP Commission Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that, despite the long-standing efforts and resources of the United States dedicated to helping needy people around the world, despair remains and in many areas is growing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Therefore, a commission should be established to bring together the best minds associated with development and humanitarian assistance to make a comprehensive review of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) policy decisions, including why certain development projects are funded and others are not, successes, and best practices, including their applicability to other existing programs and projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) delivery obstacles, including the roles of United States agencies and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) methodology, including whether the delivery of United States development assistance always represents best practices and whether it can be improved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) results, including measuring improvements in human capacity instead of in purely economic terms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An examination of these issues should present new approaches and ideas to ensure that United States development assistance reaches and benefits its intended recipients.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of Commission; responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is established the Helping to Enhance the Livelihood of People (HELP) Around the Globe Commission (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify the past and present objectives of United States development assistance, identify cases in which those objectives have been met, identify the beneficiaries of such assistance, and what percentage of the funds provided actually reached the intended beneficiaries;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the established policy of the United States to support and seek protection of tropical forests around the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Tropical forests provide a wide range of benefits to humankind by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) harboring a major share of the Earth's biological and terrestrial resources, which are the basis for developing pharmaceutical products and revitalizing agricultural crops;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) playing a critical role as carbon sinks in reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thus moderating potential global climate change; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) regulating hydrological cycles on which far-flung agricultural and coastal resources depend.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) International negotiations and assistance programs to conserve forest resources have proliferated over the past decade, but the rapid rate of tropical deforestation continues unabated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Developing countries with urgent needs for investment and capital for development have allocated a significant amount of their forests to logging concessions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Poverty and economic pressures on the populations of developing countries have, over time, resulted in clearing of vast areas of forest for conversion to agriculture, which is often unsustainable in the poor soils underlying tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Debt reduction can reduce economic pressures on developing countries and result in increased protection for tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Finding economic benefits to local communities from sustainable uses of tropical forests is critical to the protection of tropical forests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to recognize the values received by United States citizens from protection of tropical forests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to facilitate greater protection of tropical forests (and to give priority to protecting tropical forests with the highest levels of biodiversity and under the most severe threat) by providing for the alleviation of debt in countries where tropical forests are located, thus allowing the use of additional resources to protect these critical resources and reduce economic pressures that have led to deforestation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ensure that resources freed from debt in such countries are targeted to protection of tropical forests and their associated values; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to rechannel existing resources to facilitate the protection of tropical forests.</p>
