<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Recognizing that major private investments in less developed friendly countries or areas are often made by enterprises in which there is multinational participation, including significant United States private participation, the Corporation may make arrangements with foreign governments (including agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions thereof) or with multilateral organizations and institutions for sharing liabilities assumed under investment insurance for such investments and may in connection therewith issue insurance to investors not otherwise eligible hereunder, except that liabilities assumed by the Corporation under the authority of this subsection shall be consistent with the purposes of this subpart and that the <!-- PDFPage:535 -->maximum share of liabilities so assumed shall not exceed the proportionate participation by eligible investors in the project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before issuing insurance for the first time for loss due to business interruption, and in each subsequent instance in which a significant expansion is proposed in the type of risk to be insured under the definition of &ldquo;civil strife&rdquo; or &ldquo;business interruption&rdquo;, the Corporation shall, at least sixty days before such insurance is issued, submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report with respect to such insurance, including a thorough analysis of the risks to be covered, anticipated losses, and proposed rates and reserves and, in the case of insurance for loss due to business interruption, an explanation of the underwriting basis upon which the insurance is to be offered. Any such report with respect to insurance for loss due to business interruption shall be considered in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications pursuant to section 2394&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investment guaranties</h4>

Loans may be made under this subsection only for projects that are sponsored by or significantly involve United States small business or cooperatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation may designate up to 25 percent of any loan under this subsection for use in the development or adaptation in the United States of new technologies or new products or services that are to be used in the project for which the loan is made and are likely to contribute to the economic or social development of less developed countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">No loan may be made under this subsection to finance any operation for the extraction of oil or gas. The aggregate amount of loans under this subsection to finance operations for the mining or other extraction of any deposit of ore or other nonfuel minerals may not in any fiscal year exceed $4,000,000.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional insurance functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To make and carry out contracts of insurance or reinsurance, or agreements to associate or share risks, with insurance companies, financial institutions, any other persons, or groups thereof, and employing the same, where appropriate, as its agent, or acting as their agent, in the issuance and servicing of insurance, the adjustment of claims, the exercise of subrogation rights, the ceding and accepting of reinsurance, and in any other matter incident to an insurance business; except that such agreements and contracts shall be consistent with the purposes of the Corporation set forth in section 2191 of this title and shall be on equitable terms.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance Reserve; Guaranty Reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be established in the Treasury of the United States a noncredit account revolving fund, which shall be available for discharge of liabilities, as provided in subsection (d) of this section, until such time as all such liabilities have been discharged or have expired or until all of the fund has been expended in accordance with the provisions of this section. Such fund shall be funded by: (1) the funds heretofore available to discharge liabilities under predecessor guaranty authority (including housing guaranty authorities), less both the amount made available for housing guaranty programs pursuant to section 2183(b) of this title and the amount made available to the Corporation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; and (2) such sums as shall be appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section for such purpose.

<p class="statutory-body">Any payments made to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance issued under section 2194 of this title, under similar predecessor guaranty authority, or under section 2194b of this title shall be paid first out of the noncredit account revolving fund, as long as such fund remains available, and thereafter out of funds made available pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under section 2194(b) of this title or 2194(c) of this title shall be paid in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.].</p>

However, no appropriations shall be made to augment the noncredit account revolving fund until the amount of funds in the noncredit account revolving fund is less than $25,000,000. Any appropriations to augment the noncredit account revolving fund shall then only be made either pursuant to specific authorization enacted after August 27, 1974, or to satisfy the full faith and credit provision of section 2197(c) of this title. In order to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance, the Corporation is authorized to issue from time to time for purchase by the Secretary of the Treasury its notes, debentures, bonds, or other obligations; but the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000. Any such obligation shall be repaid to the Treasury within one year after the date of issue of such obligation. Any such obligation shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of any obligation authorized by this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligation of the Corporation issued under this subsection, and for such purchase he may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 after August 27, 1974. The purpose for which securities may be issued under such chapter shall include any such purchase.</p>
