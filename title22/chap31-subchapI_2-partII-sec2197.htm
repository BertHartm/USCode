<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guaranties as obligations backed by full faith and credit of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All guaranties issued prior to July 1, 1956, all guaranties issued under sections 1872(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2197_1_target" name="2197_1">1</a></sup> and 1933(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2197_1_target" name="2197_1">1</a></sup> of this title, all guaranties heretofore issued pursuant to prior guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, and all insurance, reinsurance and guaranties issued pursuant to this subpart shall constitute obligations, in accordance with the terms of such insurance, reinsurance or guaranties, of the United States of America and the full faith and credit of the United States of America is hereby pledged for the full payment and performance of such obligations.</p>

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall limit the amount of direct insurance and reinsurance issued by it under section 2194 or 2194b of this title so that risk of loss as to at least 10 per centum of the total investment of the insured and its affiliates in the project is borne by the insured and such affiliates, except that such limitation shall not apply to direct insurance or reinsurance of loans by banks or other financial institutions to unrelated parties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Fraud or misrepresentation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Claims settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Claims arising as a result of insurance, reinsurance, or guaranty operations under this subpart or under predecessor guaranty authority may be settled, and disputes arising as a result thereof may be arbitrated with the consent of the parties, on such terms and conditions as the Corporation may determine. Payment made pursuant to any such settlement, or as a result of an arbitration award, shall be final and conclusive notwithstanding any other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Presumption of compliance</h4>
