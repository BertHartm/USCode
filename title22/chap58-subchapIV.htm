<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) State Department policy concerning the advertising of security contracts at Foreign <!-- PDFPage:1250 -->Service buildings has been inconsistent over the years. In many cases, diplomatic and consular posts abroad have been given the responsibility to determine the manner in which the private sector was notified concerning an invitation for bids or a request for proposals with respect to a local guard contract. Some United States foreign missions have only chosen to advertise locally the availability of a local security guard contract abroad.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) As a result, many United States security firms that provide local guard services abroad have been unaware that local guard contracts were available for bidding abroad and such firms have been disadvantaged as a result.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Undoubtedly, United States security firms would be interested in bidding on more local guard contracts abroad if such firms knew of the opportunity to bid on such contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the objective of this section to improve the efficiency of the local guard programs abroad administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State and to ensure maximum competition for local guard contracts abroad concerning Foreign Service buildings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building which exceed $250,000 and are entered into after February 16, 1990, the Secretary of State shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish procedures to ensure that all solicitations for such contracts are adequately advertised in the Commerce and Business Daily;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) absent compelling reasons, award such contracts through the competitive process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in evaluating proposals for such contracts, award contracts to the technically acceptable firm offering the lowest evaluated price, except that proposals of United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons (as defined in subsection (d) of this section) shall be evaluated by reducing the bid price by 10 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in countries where contract denomination and/or payment in local currencies constitutes a barrier to competition by United States firms&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allow solicitations to be bid in United States dollars; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) allow contracts awarded to United States firms to be paid in United States dollars;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure that United States diplomatic and consular posts assist United States firms in obtaining local licenses and permits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) establish procedures to ensure that appropriate measures are taken by diplomatic and consular post management to assure that United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons are not disadvantaged during the solicitation and bid evaluation process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;United States person&rdquo; means a person which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the laws of any State, locality, or the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has its principal place of business in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) has been incorporated or legally organized in the United States for more than 2 years before the issuance date of the invitation for bids or request for proposals with respect to the contract under subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) has performed within the United States or overseas security services similar in complexity to the contract being bid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) with respect to the contract under subsection (c) of this section, has achieved a total business volume equal to or greater than the value of the project being bid in 3 years of the 5-year period before the date specified in subparagraph (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F)(i) employs United States citizens in at least 80 percent of its principal management positions in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) employs United States citizens in more than half of its permanent, full-time positions in the United States; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;113, div. B, &sect;1000(a)(7) [div. A, title VI, &sect;602], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A&ndash;451, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On August 7, 1998, the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were destroyed by simultaneously exploding bombs. The resulting explosions killed 220 persons and injured more than 4,000 others. Twelve Americans and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian employees of the United States Foreign Service were killed in the attack.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The United States personnel in both Dar es Salaam and Nairobi showed leadership and personal courage in their response to the attacks. Despite the havoc wreaked upon the embassies, staff in both embassies provided rapid response in locating and rescuing victims, providing emergency assistance, and quickly restoring embassy operations during a crisis.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The bombs are believed to have been set by individuals associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of a known transnational terrorist organization. In February 1998, bin Laden issued a directive to his followers that called for attacks against United States interests anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Threats continue to be made against United States diplomatic facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Accountability Review Boards were convened following the bombings, as required by Public Law 99&ndash;399 [see Tables for classification], chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe, United States Navy (Ret.) (in this section referred to as the &lsquo;Crowe panels&rsquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The conclusions of the Crowe panels were strikingly similar to those stated by the Commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, which issued an extensive embassy security report in 1985.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Crowe panels issued a report setting out many problems with security at United States diplomatic facilities, in particular the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) The United States Government has devoted inadequate resources to security against terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The United States Government places too low a priority on security concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The result has been a failure to take adequate steps to prevent tragedies such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Crowe panels found that there was an institutional failure on the part of the Department of State to recognize threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Responsibility for ensuring adequate resources for security programs is widely shared throughout the United States Government, including Congress. Unless the vulnerabilities identified by the Crowe panels are addressed in a sustained and financially realistic manner, the lives and safety of United States employees in diplomatic facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Although service in the Foreign Service or other United States Government positions abroad can never be completely without risk, the United States Government must take all reasonable steps to minimize security risks.&rdquo;</p>
