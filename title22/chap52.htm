<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a career foreign service, characterized by excellence and professionalism, is essential in the national interest to assist the President and the Secretary of State in conducting the foreign affairs of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the scope and complexity of the foreign affairs of the Nation have heightened the need for a professional foreign service that will serve the foreign affairs interests of the United States in an integrated fashion and that can provide a resource of qualified personnel for the President, the Secretary of State, and the agencies concerned with foreign affairs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Foreign Service of the United States, established under the Act of May 24, 1924 (commonly known as the Rogers Act) and continued by the Foreign Service Act of 1946, must be preserved, strengthened, and improved in order to carry out its mission effectively in response to the complex challenges of modern diplomacy and international relations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the members of the Foreign Service should be representative of the American people, aware of the principles and history of the United States and informed of current concerns and trends in American life, knowledgeable of the affairs, cultures, and languages of other countries, and available to serve in assignments throughout the world; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Foreign Service should be operated on the basis of merit principles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The objective of this chapter is to strengthen and improve the Foreign Service of the United States by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assuring, in accordance with merit principles, admission through impartial and rigorous examination, acquisition of career status only by those who have demonstrated their fitness through successful completion of probationary assignments, effective career development, advancement and retention of the ablest, and separation of those who do not meet the requisite standards of performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) fostering the development and vigorous implementation of policies and procedures, including affirmative action programs, which will facilitate and encourage (A) entry into and advancement in the Foreign Service by persons from all segments of American society, and (B) equal opportunity and fair and equitable treatment for all without regard to political affiliation, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or handicapping condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing for more efficient, economical, and equitable personnel administration through a simplified structure of Foreign Service personnel categories and salaries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establishing a statutory basis for participation by the members of the Foreign Service, through their elected representatives, in the formulation of personnel policies and procedures which affect their conditions of employment, and maintaining a fair and effective system for the resolution of individual grievances that will ensure the fullest measure of due process for the members of the Foreign Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) minimizing the impact of the hardships, disruptions, and other unusual conditions of service abroad upon the members of the Foreign Service, and mitigating the special impact of such conditions upon their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) providing salaries, allowances, and benefits that will permit the Foreign Service to at<!-- PDFPage:1134 -->tract and retain qualified personnel as well as a system of incentive payments and awards to encourage and reward outstanding performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) establishing a Senior Foreign Service which is characterized by strong policy formulation capabilities, outstanding executive leadership qualities, and highly developed functional, foreign language, and area expertise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) improving Foreign Service managerial flexibility and effectiveness;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment; rates of pay; leaves of absence; supplemental payments; transfer from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish compensation (including position classification) plans for foreign national employees of the Service and United States citizens employed under section 3951(c)(1) of this title. To the extent consistent with the public interest, each compensation plan shall be based upon prevailing wage rates and compensation practices (including participation in local social security plans) for corresponding types of positions in the locality of employment, except that such compensation plans shall provide for payment of wages to United States citizens at a rate which is no less than the then applicable minimum wage rate specified in section 206(a)(1) of title 29. Any compensation plan established under this section may include provision for (A) leaves of absence with pay for employees in accordance with prevailing law and employment practices in the locality of employment without regard to any limitation contained in section 6310 of title 5, (B) programs for voluntary transfers of such leave and voluntary leave banks, which shall, to the extent practicable, be established in a manner consistent with the provisions of subchapters III and IV, respectively, of chapter 63 of title 5, and (C) payments by the Government and employees to (i) a trust or other fund in a financial institution in order to finance future benefits for employees, including provision for retention in the fund of accumulated interest and dividends for the benefit of covered employees; or (ii) a Foreign Service National Savings Fund established in the Treasury of the United States, which (I) shall be administered by the Secretary, at whose direction the Secretary of the Treasury shall invest amounts not required for the current needs of the Fund; and (II) shall <!-- PDFPage:1158 -->be public monies, which are authorized to be appropriated and remain available without fiscal year limitation to pay benefits, to be invested in public debt obligations bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration current average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity, and to pay administrative expenses. For United States citizens under a compensation plan, the Secretary shall define those allowances and benefits provided under United States law which shall be included as part of the total compensation package, notwithstanding any other provision of law, except that this section shall not be used to override United States minimum wage requirements, or any provision of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make supplemental payments to any civil service annuitant who is a former foreign national employee of the Service (or who is receiving an annuity as a survivor of a former foreign national employee of the Service) in order to offset exchange rate losses, if the annuity being paid such annuitant is based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a salary that was fixed in a foreign currency that has appreciated in value in terms of the United States dollar; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) service in a country in which (as determined by the Secretary) the average retirement benefits being received by individuals who retired from competitive local organizations are superior to the local currency value of civil service annuities plus any other retirement benefits payable to foreign national employees who retired during similar time periods and after comparable careers with the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Whenever a foreign national employee so elects during a one-year period established by the Secretary of State with respect to each post abroad, the Secretary of the Treasury (at the direction of the Secretary of State) shall transfer such employee's interest in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to a trust or other local retirement plan certified by the United States Government under a local compensation plan established for foreign national employees pursuant to this section (excluding local social security plans).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the phrase &ldquo;employee's interest in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund&rdquo; means the total contributions of the employee and the employing agency with respect to such employee, pursuant to sections 8331(8) and 8334(a)(1) of title 5, respectively, plus interest at the rate provided in section 8334(e)(3) of such title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any such transfer shall void any annuity rights or entitlement to lump-sum credit under subchapter III of chapter 83 of such title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Employment programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of performing functions abroad, any agency or other Government establishment (including any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch) may administer employment programs for its employees who are foreign nationals, are United States citizens employed in the Service abroad who were hired while residing abroad, or are family members of Government employees assigned abroad, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary of State may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant's spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor benefit under this section (or section 4054(b) of this title), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 21/2 percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 4054(a)(5) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a former participant entitled to receive a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity computed under subsection (a) of this section, or 55 percent of any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor benefit under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor benefits which remains available under section 4054(b)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An annuity payable from the Fund under this part to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is terminated if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Surviving children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an annuitant who was a participant dies and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant and by a child or children, in addition to the annuity payable to the surviving spouse, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each child an annuity equal to the smaller of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $900, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $2,700 divided by the number of children.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an annuitant who was a participant dies and is not survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smaller of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $1,080, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $3,240 divided by the number of children.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amounts specified in this subsection are subject to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) cost-of-living adjustments as specified under section 4066(c)(3) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the minimum specified in subsection (<em>l</em>)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recomputation for remaining children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the death of the surviving spouse or former spouse or termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though the spouse, former spouse, or child had not survived the participant. If the annuity to a surviving child who has not been receiving an annuity is initiated or resumed, the annuities of any other children shall be recomputed and paid from that date as though the annuities to all currently eligible children in the family were then being initiated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment period for child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The annuity payable to a child under subsection (c) or (d) of this section shall begin on the day after the participant dies, or if the child is not then qualified, on the first day of the month in which the child becomes eligible. The annuity of a child shall terminate on the last day of the month which precedes the month in which eligibility ceases.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Unmarried participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the time of retirement an unmarried participant who does not have a former spouse for whose benefit a reduction is made under subsection (b) of this section may elect to receive a reduced annuity and to provide for an annuity equal to 55 percent of the reduced annuity payable after his or her death to a beneficiary whose name is designated in writing to the Secretary of State. The annuity payable to a participant making such election shall be reduced by 10 percent of an annuity computed under sub<!-- PDFPage:1186 -->section (a) of this section and by 5 percent of an annuity so computed for each full 5 years the designated beneficiary is younger than the retiring participant, but such total reduction shall not exceed 40 percent. No such election of a reduced annuity payable to a beneficiary shall be valid until the participant has satisfactorily passed a physical examination as prescribed by the Secretary of State. The annuity payable to a beneficiary under this subsection shall begin on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month preceding the death of the beneficiary. An annuity which is reduced under this subsection (or any similar prior provision of law) shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the beneficiary named under this subsection, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Marriage after retirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A participant or former participant who was unmarried at retirement and who later marries may, within one year after such marriage, irrevocably elect in writing to receive a reduced annuity and to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse (if such spouse qualifies as a surviving spouse under section 4044(13) of this title). Receipt by the Secretary of State of notice of an election under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made under subsection (f) of this section. The reduction in annuity required by an election under this subsection shall be computed and the amount of the survivor annuity shall be determined in accordance with subsections (b)(2) and (3) of this section. The annuity reduction or recomputation shall be effective the first day of the month beginning one year after the date of marriage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Election of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A surviving spouse or surviving former spouse of any participant or former participant shall not become entitled to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of a survivor annuity payable from the Fund under this part unless the survivor elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which he or she may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than that participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Reversion to retired status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any married annuitant who reverts to retired status with entitlement to a supplemental annuity under section 4063 of this title shall, unless the annuitant and his or her spouse jointly elect in writing to the contrary at that time, have the supplemental annuity reduced by 10 percent to provide a supplemental survivor annuity for his or her spouse. Such supplemental survivor annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of the supplemental annuity of the annuitant and shall be payable to a surviving spouse to whom the annuitant was married at the time of reversion to retired status or whom the annuitant subsequently married.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of State shall issue regulations to provide for the application of paragraph (1) of this subsection and of section 4063 of this title in any case in which an annuitant has a former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service and who qualifies for an annuity under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Recomputation upon dissolution of marriage; election after remarriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An annuity which is reduced under this section or any similar prior provision of law to provide a survivor benefit for a spouse shall, if the marriage of the participant to such spouse is dissolved, be recomputed and paid for each full month during which an annuitant is not married (or is remarried if there is no election in effect under the following sentence) as if the annuity had not been so reduced, subject to any reduction required to provide a survivor benefit under section 4054(b) or (c) of this title. Upon remarriage the retired participant may irrevocably elect, by means of a signed writing received by the Secretary within one year after such remarriage, to receive during such marriage a reduction in annuity for the purpose of allowing an annuity for the new spouse of the annuitant in the event such spouse survives the annuitant. Such reduction shall be equal to the reduction in effect immediately before the dissolution of the previous marriage (unless such reduction is adjusted under section 4054(b)(5) of this title), and shall be effective the first day of the first month beginning one year after the date of remarriage. A survivor annuity elected under this subsection shall be treated in all respects as a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Informing of rights by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State shall, on an annual basis&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inform each participant of his or her right of election under subsections (g) and (j) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the maximum extent practicable, inform spouses or former spouses of participants or former participants of their rights under this section and section 4054 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4047. Payment of annuity</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2), the annuity of a participant who has met the eligibility requirements for an annuity shall commence on the first day of the month after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) separation from the Service occurs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) pay ceases and the service and age requirements for entitlement to annuity are met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The annuity of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a participant who is retired and is eligible for benefits under section 4009(a) of this title or a participant who is retired under section 4053 of this title or is otherwise involuntarily separated from the Service, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a participant retiring under section 4048 of this title due to a disability, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a participant who serves 3 days or less in the month of retirement&mdash;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall commence on the day after separation from the Service or the day after pay ceases and the requirements for entitlement to annuity are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Survivor's annuity; application; proof of eligibility; payment to estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The annuity to a survivor shall become effective as otherwise specified but shall not be paid until the survivor submits an application for such annuity, supported by such proof of eligibility as the Secretary of State may require. If such application or proof of eligibility is not submitted during the lifetime of an otherwise eligible individual, no annuity shall be due or payable to his or her estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An individual entitled to annuity from the Fund may decline to accept all or any part of the annuity by submitting a signed waiver to the Secretary of State. The waiver may be revoked in writing at any time. Payment of the annuity waived may not be made for the period during which the waiver was in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recovery of overpayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Recovery of overpayments under this part may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Secretary of State, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience or administratively infeasible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Alternate forms of annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of State shall prescribe regulations under which any participant who has a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition may, at the time of retiring under this part (other than under section 4048 of this title), elect annuity benefits under this section instead of any other benefits under this part (including survivor benefits) based on the service of the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary of State shall by regulation provide for such alternative forms of annuities as the Secretary considers appropriate, except that among the alternatives offered shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an alternative which provides for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the participant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) payment of an annuity to the participant for life; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a participant who is married at the time of retirement, an alternative which provides for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the participant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) payment of an annuity to the participant for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of a surviving spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each alternative provided for under paragraph (2) shall, to the extent practicable, be designed such that the total value of the benefits provided under such alternative (including any lump-sum credit) is actuarially equivalent to the value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided the participant under this part, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A participant who, at the time of retiring under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is married, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section unless a waiver is made under section 4046(b)(1)(B) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has a former spouse, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section if the former spouse is entitled to benefits under this part (based on the service of the participant) unless a waiver has been made under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A participant who is married at the time of retiring under this part and who makes an election under this section may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of retirement, make the election provided for under section 4046(n) of this title, subject to the deposit requirement thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any lump-sum credit provided pursuant to an election under this subsection shall not preclude an individual from receiving any other benefits under this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-start:head -->
<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4048. Retirement for disability or incapacity</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Causes; service credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any participant who has at least 5 years of service credit toward retirement under the System (excluding military and naval service) and who becomes totally disabled or incapacitated for useful and efficient service by reason of disease, illness, or injury (not due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful conduct of the participant) shall, upon his or her own application or upon order of the Secretary, be retired on an annuity computed as prescribed in section 4046 of this title. If the disabled or incapacitated participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the System at the time of retirement, his or her annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, except that the additional service credit that may accrue to a participant under this sentence shall in no case exceed the difference between his or her age at the time of retirement and age 60.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">However, if a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of title 5) or Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under this part excluding extra credit authorized by this subsection and excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in section 5532&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4048_1_target" name="4048_1">1</a></sup> of title 5 or the Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation in lieu of such retired pay or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this part in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity computed under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Physical examination; reinstatement or reappointment upon recovery; fees and expenses; duration and suspension of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before being retired under this section, the participant shall be given a physical examination by one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons designated by the Secretary of State to conduct examinations. Disability or incapacity shall be determined by the Secretary of State on the basis of the advice of such physicians or surgeons. Unless the disability or incapacity is permanent, like examinations shall be made annually until the annuitant has attained age 60. If the Secretary of State determines on the basis of the advice of one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons conducting such examinations that an annuitant has recovered to the extent that he or she can return to duty, the annuitant may apply for reinstatement or reappointment in the Service within 1 year from the date recovery is determined. Upon application, the Secretary shall reinstate such recovered annuitant in the class in which the annuitant was serving at time of retirement, or the Secretary may, taking into consideration the age, qualifications, and experience of such annuitant, and the present class of his or her contemporaries in the Service, appoint or recommend that the President appoint the annuitant to a higher class. Payment of the annuity shall continue until a date 6 months after the date of the examination showing recovery or until the date of reinstatement or reappointment in the Service, whichever is earlier. Fees for examinations under this section, together with reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to submit to examination, shall be paid out of the Fund. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required under this subsection, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability or incapacity is satisfactorily established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Benefits upon discontinuance of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a recovered annuitant whose annuity is discontinued is for any reason not reinstated or reappointed in the Service, he or she shall be considered to have been separated within the meaning of section 4050 of this title as of the date of retirement for disability or incapacity and shall, after the discontinuance of the annuity, be entitled to the benefits of that section or of section 4055 of this title, except that he or she may elect voluntary retirement if eligible under section 4051 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Election of benefits; concurrent benefits allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No participant shall be entitled to receive an annuity under this part and compensation for injury or disability to himself or herself under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, covering the same period of time, except that a participant may simultaneously receive both an annuity under this section and scheduled disability payments under section 8107 of title 5. This subsection shall not bar the right of any claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this part or subchapter I of such chapter 8&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4048_2_target" name="4048_2">2</a></sup> for any part of the same period of time. Neither this subsection nor any provision of subchapter I of such chapter 8&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4048_2_target" name="4048_2">2</a></sup> shall be construed to deny the right of any participant to receive an annuity under this part and to receive concurrently any payment under subchapter I of such chapter 8&nbsp;<sup><a href="#4048_2_target" name="4048_2">2</a></sup> by reason of the death of any other individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Lump sum disability payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other law, the right of any individual entitled to an annuity under this part shall not be affected because such person has received an award of compensation in a <!-- PDFPage:1191 -->lump sum under section 8135 of title 5, except that where such annuity is payable on account of the same disability for which compensation under such section has been paid, so much of such compensation as has been paid for any period extended beyond the date such annuity becomes effective, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall be refunded to the Department of Labor, to be paid into the Federal Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund. Before such individual receives such annuity, he or she shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) refund to the Department of Labor the amount representing such commuted payments for such extended period, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) authorize the deduction of such amount from the annuity payable under this part, which amount shall be transmitted to the Department of Labor for reimbursement to such Fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Deductions from such annuity may be made from accrued and accruing payments, or may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Secretary of Labor shall determine, whenever the Secretary of Labor finds that the financial circumstances of the annuitant warrant deferred refunding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time of filing application; waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Secretary of State before the participant is separated from the Service or within one year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Secretary of State for a participant who at the date of separation from the Service or within one year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Secretary of State within one year from the date of restoration of the participant to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Lump-sum credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a participant dies and no claim for annuity is payable under this part, the lump-sum credit shall be paid in accordance with section 4055 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or former spouse qualifying for an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title, such surviving spouse shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with subsections (e) and (g) of this section and section 4046(a) of this title and any surviving former spouse shall be entitled to an annuity under section 4054(b) of this title as if the participant died after being entitled to an annuity under this part. If the participant had less than 3 years creditable civilian service at the time of death, the survivor annuity shall be computed on the basis of the average salary for the entire period of such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Surviving spouse or former spouse, and children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, and a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(1) and (d) of section 4046 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Surviving children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System dies before retirement or other separation from the Service and is not survived by a spouse, or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be entitled to an annuity computed in accordance with subsections (c)(2) and (d) of section 4046 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Service credit; presumption of qualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at the time of his or her death, the participant had less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the System, the annuity payable in accordance with subsection (b) of this section shall be computed in accordance with section 4046 of this title on the assumption he or she has had 20 years of service, except that the additional service credit that may accrue to a <!-- PDFPage:1192 -->deceased participant under this subsection shall in no case exceed the difference between his or her age on the date of death and age 60. In all cases arising under this subsection or subsection (b), (c), (d), or (g) of this section, it shall be assumed that the deceased participant was qualified for retirement on the date of death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recall service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity dies in service after being recalled under section 3948 of this title and is survived by a spouse or former spouse entitled to a survivor annuity based on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise terminated on the day of death and the annuity of the deceased had been resumed in accordance with section 4063 of this title. If such death occurs after the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service shall be entitled to elect, in addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor annuity computed and paid under section 4046(i) of this title as if the recall service had otherwise terminated. If the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his or her annuity determined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse may elect, in lieu of any other survivor benefit under this subchapter, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under subsection (b) of this section on the basis of the total service of the annuitant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitation on surviving spouse's annuity</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;creditable service&rdquo; means service which is creditable under part I or II of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the later of the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this part or the first day of the month in which the divorce or annulment involved becomes final. The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before 60 years of age; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title involving any participant may provide for an annuity or any combination of annuities under this subsection which exceeds the annuity of the participant, nor may any such court order relating to an annuity under this subsection be given effect if it is issued more than 24 months after the date the divorce or annulment involved becomes final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this part, and in calculating any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) of this section or section 4046(b)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If any annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 3948 of this title, or reinstated or reappointed in the Service in the case of a recovered disability annuitant or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under section 4064 of this title, the salary of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of any former spouse of a disability annuitant&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deceased Service members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to any election under section 4046(b)(1)(C) of this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title, if a former participant who is entitled to receive an annuity is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse shall be entitled to a survivor annuity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if married to the participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that former spouse's pro rata share of 55 percent of the full amount of such annuity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;creditable service&rdquo; means service which is creditable under part I or II of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An annuity payable from the Fund under this part to a surviving former spouse under this subsection shall commence on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse's <!-- PDFPage:1195 -->death or remarriage before attaining age 60. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is terminated if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The maximum survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under this section (and section 4046(b)(3) of this title) with respect to any participant or former participant may not exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as calculated under section 4046(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Once a survivor annuity has been provided for under this subsection for any former spouse, a survivor annuity may thereafter be provided for under this subsection (or section 4046(b)(3) of this title) with respect to a participant or former participant only for that portion (if any) of the maximum available which is not committed for survivor benefits for any former spouse whose prospective right to such annuity has not terminated by reason of death or remarriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) After the death of a participant or former participant, a court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title may not adjust the amount of the annuity of any former spouse under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For each full month after a former spouse of a participant or former participant dies or remarries before attaining age 60, the annuity of the participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 4046(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity benefit under subsection (b) of this section for a former spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such participant may elect, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a spousal agreement or court order under section 4060(b)(1) of this title may provide for,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">an additional survivor annuity under this subsection for any other former spouse or spouse surviving the participant, if the participant satisfactorily passes a physical examination as prescribed by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Neither the total amount of survivor annuity or annuities under this subsection with respect to any participant or former participant, nor the survivor annuity or annuities for any one surviving spouse or former spouse of such participant under this section and section 4046 of this title, shall exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as computed under section 4046(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In accordance with regulations which the Secretary of State shall prescribe, the participant involved may provide for any annuity under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by a reduction in the annuity or an allotment from the salary of the participant,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by a lump sum payment or installment payments to the Fund, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) by any combination thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The present value of the total amount to accrue to the Fund under subparagraph (A) to provide any annuity under this subsection shall be actuarially equivalent in value to such annuity, as calculated upon such tables of mortality as may from time to time be prescribed for this purpose by the Secretary of State.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cost-of-living annuity increase shall become effective under this section on the effective date of each such increase under section 8340(b) of title 5. Each such increase shall be applied to each annuity payable from the Fund under this part which has a commencing date not later than the effective date of the increase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicability of increases under other provisions of law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each annuity increase under this section shall be identical to the corresponding percentage increase under section 8340(b) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section shall be governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the Fund under this part as of the effective date of an increase except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The first increase (if any) made under this section to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to a participant or to the surviving spouse or former spouse of a deceased participant who died in service or a deceased annuitant whose annuity was not increased under this section, shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1/12 of the applicable percent change computed under subsection (b) of this section, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of months (counting any portion of a month as a month)&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable from the Fund under this part to the survivor of an annuitant, except a child entitled to an annuity under section 4046(c) of this title or section 4049(c) or (d) of this title, shall be increased by the total percentage increase the annuitant was receiving under this section at death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For purposes of computing or recomputing an annuity to a child under section 4046(c) or (d) of this title or section 4049(c) or (d) of this title, the items $900, $1,080, $2,700, and $3,240 appearing in section 4046(c) of this title shall be increased by the total percentage increases by which corresponding amounts are being increased under section 8340 of title 5 on the date the annuity of the child becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusion of additional annuity purchased after retirement by voluntary contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No increase in annuity provided by this section shall be computed on any additional annuity purchased at retirement by voluntary contributions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rounding off of amount; minimum increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The monthly installment of annuity after adjustment under this section shall be rounded to the next lowest dollar, except such installment shall after adjustment reflect an increase of at least $1.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Effective from its commencing date, there shall be an increase of 10 percent in the annuity of each surviving spouse whose entitlement to annuity resulted from the death of an annuitant who, prior to October 1, 1976, elected a reduced annuity in order to provide a spouse's survivor annuity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Maximum annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An annuity shall not be increased by reason of any adjustment under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the former participant with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased by the overall annual average percentage adjustments (compounded) in rates of pay of the Foreign Service Schedule under such section 3963 of this title during the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) beginning on the date the annuity commenced (or, in the case of a survivor of the retired participant, the date the participant's annuity commenced), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) ending on the effective date of the adjustment under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, &ldquo;pay&rdquo; means the rate of salary or basic pay as payable under any provision of law, including any provision of law limiting the expenditure of appropriated funds.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4136. Foreign Service Grievance Board procedures</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may adopt regulations concerning its organization and procedures. Such regulations shall include provision for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Board shall conduct a hearing at the request of a grievant in any case which involves&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) disciplinary action or the retirement of a grievant from the Service under section 4007 or 4008 of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issues which, in the judgment of the Board, can best be resolved by a hearing or presentation of oral argument.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The grievant, the representatives of the grievant, the exclusive representative (if the grievant is a member of the bargaining unit represented by the exclusive representative), and the representatives of the Department are entitled to be present at the hearing. The Board may, after considering the views of the parties and any other individuals connected with the grievance, decide that a hearing should be open to others. Testimony at a hearing shall be given under oath, which any Board member or individual designated by the Board shall have authority to administer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Each party (including an exclusive representative appearing in the proceedings) shall be entitled to examine and cross-examine witnesses at the hearing or by deposition and to serve interrogatories upon another party and have such interrogatories answered by the other party unless the Board finds such interrogatory irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitive. Upon request of the Board, or upon a request of the grievant deemed relevant and material by the Board, an agency shall promptly make available at the hearing or by deposition any witness under its control, supervision, or responsibility, except that if the Board determines that the presence of such witness at the hearing is required for just resolution of the grievance, then the witness shall be made available at the hearing, with necessary costs and travel expenses paid by the Department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) During any hearing held by the Board, any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the Board shall exclude any irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, as determined under section 556 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A verbatim transcript shall be made of any hearing and shall be part of the record of proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In those grievances in which the Board does not hold a hearing, the Board shall afford to each party the opportunity to review and to supplement, by written submissions, the record of proceedings prior to the decision by the Board. The decision of the Board shall be based exclusively on the record of proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The Board may act by or through panels or individual members designated by the Chairperson, except that hearings within the continental United States shall be held by panels of at least three members unless the parties agree otherwise. References in this subchapter to the Board shall be considered to be references to a panel or member of the Board where appropriate. All members of the Board shall act as impartial individuals in considering grievances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) If the Board determines that the Department is considering the involuntary separation of the grievant (other than an involuntary separation for cause under section 4010(a) of this title), disciplinary action against the grievant, or recovery from the grievant of alleged overpayment of salary, expenses, or allowances, which is related to a grievance pending before the Board and that such action should be suspended, the Department shall suspend such action until the date which is one year after such determination or until the Board has ruled upon the grievance, whichever <!-- PDFPage:1243 -->comes first. The Board shall extend the one-year limitation under the preceding sentence and the Department shall continue to suspend such action, if the Board determines that the agency or the Board is responsible for the delay in the resolution of the grievance. The Board may also extend the 1-year limit if it determines that the delay is due to the complexity of the case, the unavailability of witnesses or to circumstances beyond the control of the agency, the Board or the grievant. Notwithstanding such suspension of action, the head of the agency concerned or a chief of mission or principal officer may exclude the grievant from official premises or from the performance of specified functions when such exclusion is determined in writing to be essential to the functioning of the post or office to which the grievant is assigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Board may reconsider any decision upon presentation of newly discovered or previously unavailable material evidence.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Record; findings of fact and statement of reasons</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Board finds that the grievance is meritorious and that remedial action should be taken that relates directly to promotion, tenure or assignment of the grievant or to other remedial action not otherwise provided for in this section, or if the Board finds that the evidence before it warrants disciplinary action against any employee of the Department or member of the Service, it shall make an appropriate recommendation to the Secretary. The Secretary shall make a written decision on the recommendation <!-- PDFPage:1244 -->of the Board within 30 days after receiving the recommendation. The Secretary shall implement the recommendation of the Board except to the extent that, in a decision made within that 30-day period, the Secretary rejects the recommendation in whole or in part on the basis of a determination that implementation of the recommendation would be contrary to law or would adversely affect the foreign policy or national security of the United States. If the Secretary rejects the recommendation in whole or in part, the decision shall specify the reasons for such action. Pending the decision of the Secretary, there shall be no ex parte communication concerning the grievance between the Secretary and any person involved in the proceedings of the Board.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A recommendation made under subparagraph (B) shall be considered a final action for purposes of section 4140 of this title, and shall be implemented by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Record of grievances; copy to committee of Congress; right of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Board shall maintain records of all grievances awarded in favor of the grievant in which the grievance concerns gross misconduct by a supervisor.

Such comments shall be treated in a confidential manner.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with the findings of section 3901 of this title, the Foreign Service of the United States should be representative of the American people. In order to facilitate and encourage the entry into the Foreign Service of individuals who meet the rigorous requirements of the Service, while ensuring a Foreign Service system which reflects the cultural and ethnic diversity of the United States, intensive recruitment efforts are mandated. This is particularly true for Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans, where other affirmative action and equal opportunity efforts have not been successful in attracting the ablest applicants for entry into the Foreign Service. The United States remains committed to equal opportunity and to a Foreign Service system operated on the basis of merit principles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The objective of this subchapter is to strengthen and improve the Foreign Service of the United States through the establishment of a Foreign Service Internship Program. The program shall promote the Foreign Service as a viable and rewarding career opportunity for qualified individuals who reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the United States through a highly selective internship program for students enrolled in institutions of higher education.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In consultation with the heads of other agencies utilizing the Foreign Service system, the Secretary of State shall establish a Foreign Service internship program to carry out the objectives of this subchapter in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foreign Service Internship Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program shall introduce interns to the practice of diplomacy and the unique rewards of the Foreign Service. The program shall consist of three successive summer internships of not less than eight weeks duration in each year to be completed over the course of not more than four years. Special emphasis shall be given to preparing the intern for the Foreign Service examination process. In each year not less than 10 interns shall enter the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility to participate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Students enrolled full-time in institutions of higher education from groups which are underrepresented in the Foreign Service in terms of the cultural and ethnic diversity of the Foreign Service and for whom equal opportunity and affirmative action recruitment efforts have not been successful in achieving balanced representation in appointments to the Foreign Service shall be eligible to be interns in programs under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An intern shall have successfully completed not less than one academic year of study at an institution of higher education to be admitted to the program. In each succeeding year of participation an intern shall have completed an additional year of undergraduate or graduate study and shall maintain an exemplary record of academic achievement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In selecting interns, the Secretary shall consider only the ablest students of superior ability selected on the basis of demonstrated achievement and exceptional promise whose academic records reflect the requisite standards of performance necessary for the Foreign Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Summer internships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The primary focus of the first internship shall be the study of international relations, the functions of the Department of State and other agencies which utilize the Foreign Service system, and the nature of the Foreign Service. The internship shall be held in Washington, District of Columbia, at the Department of State. As ap<!-- PDFPage:1247 -->propriate, the Secretary shall utilize the personnel and facilities of the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The second internship shall be, principally, an assignment to a specific bureau of the Department of State. Emphasis shall be on providing insight into the economic and political functional areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The third internship shall be an assignment to a United States mission abroad in the political or economic area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The first and second internships may include a detail to the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State shall determine the academic requirements, other selection criteria, and standards for successful completion of each internship period. The Secretary shall be responsible for the design, implementation, and operation of the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Mentors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each intern shall be assigned a career Foreign Service officer as a mentor. The mentor shall act as a counselor and advisor throughout each summer internship and as a personal Foreign Service contact throughout the period of participation in the program. In the assignment of mentors, the Secretary shall give preference to Foreign Service officers who volunteer for such assignment and who may be role models for the interns.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interns shall be compensated at a rate determined by the Secretary which shall not be less than the compensation of comparable summer interns at the Department of State. As determined by the Secretary, for the purposes of travel, housing, health insurance, and other appropriate benefits, interns shall be considered employees of the Foreign Service during each internship period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Study of Foreign Service examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State shall study the feasibility of administering the Foreign Service examination in separate segments over several years. Not later than 180 days after February 16, 1990, the Secretary shall submit a report summarizing the findings of such a study to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.</p>
