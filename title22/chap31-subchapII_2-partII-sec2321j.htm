<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notification to committees of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may not transfer excess defense articles under this section until 30 days after he has notified the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives of the proposed transfer.
