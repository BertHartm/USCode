<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8101. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices poses a grave threat to the national security of the United States and its vital national interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has proven critical to limiting such proliferation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be effective, each of the non-nuclear-weapon State Parties must conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and such agreements must be honored and enforced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Recent events emphasize the urgency of strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. This can best be accomplished by providing IAEA inspectors with more information about, and broader access to, nuclear activities within the territory of non-nuclear-weapon State Parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The proposed scope of such expanded information and access has been negotiated by the member states of the IAEA in the form of a Model Additional Protocol to its existing safeguards agreements, and universal acceptance of Additional Protocols by non-nuclear weapons states is essential to enhancing the effectiveness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) On June 12, 1998, the United States, as a nuclear-weapon State Party, signed an Additional Protocol that is based on the Model Additional Protocol, but which also contains measures, consistent with its existing safeguards agreements with its members, that protect the right of the United States to exclude the application of IAEA safeguards to locations and activities with direct national security significance or to locations or information associated with such activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Implementation of the Additional Protocol in the United States in a manner consistent with United States obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty may encourage other parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, especially non-nuclear-weapon State Parties, to conclude Additional Protocols and thereby strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty safeguards system and help reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation, which is of direct and substantial benefit to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Implementation of the Additional Protocol by the United States is not required and is completely voluntary given its status as a nuclear-weapon State Party, but the United <!-- PDFPage:1677 -->States has acceded to the Additional Protocol to demonstrate its commitment to the nuclear nonproliferation regime and to make United States civil nuclear activities available to the same IAEA inspections as are applied in the case of non-nuclear-weapon State Parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) In accordance with the national security exclusion contained in Article 1.b of its Additional Protocol, the United States will not allow any inspection activities, nor make any declaration of any information with respect to, locations, information, and activities of direct national security significance to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Implementation of the Additional Protocol will conform to the principles set forth in the letter of April 30, 2002, from the United States Permanent Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Vienna Office of the United Nations to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), an appropriate official of the United States Government shall seek or have the consent of the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of a location prior to entering that location in connection with complementary access pursuant to sections 8121 and 8122 of this title. The owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location may withhold consent for any reason or no reason.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Administrative search warrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the absence of consent, the United States Government may seek an administrative search warrant from a judge of the United States under subsection (b). Proceedings regarding the issuance of an administrative search warrant shall be conducted ex parte, unless otherwise requested by the United States Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expedited access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of obtaining access to a location pursuant to Article 4b.(ii) of the Additional Protocol in order to satisfy United States obligations under the Additional Protocol when notice of two hours or less is required, the United States Government may gain entry to such location in connection with complementary access, to the extent such access is consistent with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, without obtaining either a warrant or consent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative search warrants for complementary access</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Obtaining administrative search warrants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For complementary access conducted in the United States pursuant to the Additional Protocol, and for which the acquisition of a warrant is required, the United States Government shall first obtain an administrative <!-- PDFPage:1680 -->search warrant from a judge of the United States. The United States Government shall provide to such judge all appropriate information regarding the basis for the selection of the facility, site, or other location to which complementary access is sought.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Content of affidavits for administrative search warrants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A judge of the United States shall promptly issue an administrative search warrant authorizing the requested complementary access upon an affidavit submitted by the United States Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) stating that the Additional Protocol is in force;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) stating that the designated facility, site, or other location is subject to complementary access under the Additional Protocol;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) stating that the purpose of the complementary access is consistent with Article 4 of the Additional Protocol;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) stating that the requested complementary access is in accordance with Article 4 of the Additional Protocol;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) containing assurances that the scope of the IAEA's complementary access, as well as what it may collect, shall be limited to the access provided for in Article 6 of the Additional Protocol;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) listing the items, documents, and areas to be searched and seized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) stating the earliest commencement and the anticipated duration of the complementary access period, as well as the expected times of day during which such complementary access will take place; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) stating that the location to which entry in connection with complementary access is sought was selected either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) because there is probable cause, on the basis of specific evidence, to believe that information required to be reported regarding a location pursuant to regulations promulgated under this chapter is incorrect or incomplete, and that the location to be accessed contains evidence regarding that violation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) pursuant to a reasonable general administrative plan based upon specific neutral criteria.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Content of warrants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A warrant issued under paragraph (2) shall specify the same matters required of an affidavit under that paragraph. In addition, each warrant shall contain the identities of the representatives of the IAEA on the complementary access team and the identities of the representatives or designees of the United States Government required to display identifying credentials under section 8122(c) of this title.</p>
