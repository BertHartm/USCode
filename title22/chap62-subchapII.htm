<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the international debt problem threatens the safety and soundness of the international financial system, the stability of the international trading system, and the economic development of the debtor countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orderly reduction of international trade imbalances requires very substantial growth in all parts of the world economy, particularly in the developing countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) growth in developing countries with substantial external debts has been significantly constrained over the last several years by a combination of high debt service obligations and insufficient new flows of financial resources to these countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) substantial interest payment outflows from debtor countries, combined with inadequate net new capital inflows, have produced a significant net transfer of financial resources from debtor to creditor countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) negative resource transfers at present levels severely depress both investment and growth in the debtor countries, and force debtor countries to reduce imports and expand exports in order to meet their debt service obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) current adjustment policies in debtor countries, which depress domestic demand and increase production for export, help to depress world commodity prices and limit the growth of export markets for United States industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the United States has borne a disproportionate share of the burden of absorbing increased exports from debtor countries, while other industrialized countries have increased their imports from developing countries only slightly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) current approaches to the debt problem should not rely solely on new lending as a solution to the debt problem, and should focus on other financing alternatives including a reduction in current debt service obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) new international mechanisms to improve the management of the debt problem and to expand the range of financing options available to developing countries should be explored; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) industrial countries with strong current account surpluses have a disproportionate share of the world's capital resources, and bear an additional responsibility for contributing to a viable long-term solution to the debt problem.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to alleviate the current international debt problem in order to make the debt situation of developing countries more manageable and permit the resumption of sustained growth in those countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to increase the stability of the world financial system and ensure the safety and soundness of United States depository institutions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Directive</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall study the feasibility and advisability of establishing the International Debt Management Authority described in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Explanation of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that initiation of international discussions with regard to such authority would (A) result in material increase in the discount at which sovereign debt is sold, (B) materially increase the probability of default on such debt, or (C) materially enhance the likelihood of debt service failure or disruption, the Secretary shall include in his interim reports to the Congress an explanation in detail of the reasons for such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Initiation of discussions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless such a determination is made, the Secretary of the Treasury shall initiate discussions with such industrialized and developing countries as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate with the intent to negotiate the establishment of the International Debt <!-- PDFPage:1301 -->Management Authority, which would undertake to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) purchase sovereign debt of less developed countries from private creditors at an appropriate discount;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enter into negotiations with the debtor countries for the purpose of restructuring the debt in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) ease the current debt service burden on the debtor countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide additional opportunities for economic growth in both debtor and industrialized countries; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) assist the creditor banks in the voluntary disposition of their Third World loan portfolio.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any discussions initiated under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary should include the following specific proposals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That any loan restructuring assistance provided by such an authority to any debtor nation should involve substantial commitments by the debtor to (A) economic policies designed to improve resource utilization and minimize capital flight, and (B) preparation of an economic management plan calculated to provide sustained economic growth and to allow the debtor to meet its restructured debt obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That support for such an authority should come from industrialized countries, and that greater support should be expected from countries with strong current account surpluses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That such an authority should have a clearly defined close working relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the various regional development banks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) That such an authority should be designed to operate as a self-supporting entity, requiring no routine appropriation of resources from any member government, and to function subject to the prohibitions contained in the first sentence of section 5332(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) That such an authority should have a defined termination date and a clear proposal for the restoration of creditworthiness to debtor countries within this timeframe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interim reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of the 6-month period beginning on August 23, 1988, and at the end of the 12-month period beginning on August 23, 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report on the progress being made on the study or in discussions described in subsection (a) of this section to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and shall consult with such committees after submitting each such report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Final report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the conclusion of the study or of discussions described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall transmit a report containing a detailed description thereof to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, together with such recommendations for legislation which the Secretary may determine to be necessary or appropriate for the establishment of the International Debt Management Authority.</p>
