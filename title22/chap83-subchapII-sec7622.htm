<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by the Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (Public Law 106&ndash;264) [22 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Section 2, Article 5 of the bylaws of the Global Fund provides for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to serve as the initial collection trustee for the Global Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The trustee agreement signed between the Global Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development narrows the range of duties to include receiving and investing funds from donors, disbursing the funds upon the instruction of the Global Fund, reporting on trust fund resources to donors and the Global Fund, and providing an annual external audit report to the Global Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority for United States participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) United States participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States is hereby authorized to participate in the Global Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Privileges and immunities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Global Fund shall be considered a public international organization for purposes of section 288 of this title.</p>
