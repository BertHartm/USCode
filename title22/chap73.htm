<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The right to freedom of religion undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States. Many of our Nation's founders fled religious persecution abroad, cherishing in their hearts and minds the ideal of religious freedom. They established in law, as a fundamental right and as a pillar of our Nation, the right to freedom of religion. From its birth to this day, the United States has prized this legacy of religious freedom and honored this heritage by standing for religious freedom and offering refuge to those suffering religious persecution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Freedom of religious belief and practice is a universal human right and fundamental freedom articulated in numerous international instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Accords, the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the United Nations Charter, and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that &ldquo;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.&rdquo;. Article 18(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes that &ldquo;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching&rdquo;. Governments have the responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of their citizens and to pursue justice for all. Religious freedom is a fundamental right of every individual, regardless of race, sex, country, creed, or nationality, and should never be arbitrarily abridged by any government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The right to freedom of religion is under renewed and, in some cases, increasing assault in many countries around the world. More than one-half of the world's population lives under regimes that severely restrict or prohibit the freedom of their citizens to study, believe, observe, and freely practice the religious faith of their choice. Religious believers and communities suffer both government-sponsored and government-tolerated violations of their rights to religious freedom. Among the many forms of such violations are state-sponsored slander campaigns, confiscations of property, surveillance by security police, including by special divisions of &ldquo;religious police&rdquo;, severe prohibitions against construction and repair of places of worship, denial of the right to assemble and relegation of religious communities to illegal status through arbitrary registration laws, prohibitions against the pursuit of education or public office, and prohibitions against publishing, distributing, or possessing religious literature and materials.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Even more abhorrent, religious believers in many countries face such severe and violent forms of religious persecution as detention, torture, beatings, forced marriage, rape, imprisonment, enslavement, mass resettlement, and death merely for the peaceful belief in, change of or practice of their faith. In many countries, religious believers are forced to meet secretly, and religious leaders are targeted by national security forces and hostile mobs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Though not confined to a particular region or regime, religious persecution is often <!-- PDFPage:1317 -->particularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under totalitarian governments and in countries with militant, politicized religious majorities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Congress has recognized and denounced acts of religious persecution through the adoption of the following resolutions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) House Resolution 515 of the One Hundred Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to the persecution of Christians worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Senate Concurrent Resolution 71 of the One Hundred Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding persecution of Christians worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) House Concurrent Resolution 102 of the One Hundred Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives concerning the emancipation of the Iranian Baha'i community.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the policy of the United States, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To condemn violations of religious freedom, and to promote, and to assist other governments in the promotion of, the fundamental right to freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To seek to channel United States security and development assistance to governments other than those found to be engaged in gross violations of the right to freedom of religion, as set forth in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], in the International Financial Institutions Act of 1977, and in other formulations of United States human rights policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To be vigorous and flexible, reflecting both the unwavering commitment of the United States to religious freedom and the desire of the United States for the most effective and principled response, in light of the range of violations of religious freedom by a variety of persecuting regimes, and the status of the relations of the United States with different nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To work with foreign governments that affirm and protect religious freedom, in order to develop multilateral documents and initiatives to combat violations of religious freedom and promote the right to religious freedom abroad.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Standing for liberty and standing with the persecuted, to use and implement appropriate tools in the United States foreign policy apparatus, including diplomatic, political, commercial, charitable, educational, and cultural channels, to promote respect for religious freedom by all governments and peoples.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Response to particularly severe violations of religious freedom</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) United States policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to oppose particularly severe violations of religious freedom that are or have been engaged in or tolerated by the governments of foreign countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to promote the right to freedom of religion in those countries through the actions described in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirement of Presidential action</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designations of countries of particular concern for religious freedom</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Annual review</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than September 1 of each year, the President shall review the status of religious freedom in each foreign country to determine whether the government of that country has engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom in that country during the preceding 12 months or since the date of the last review of that country under this subparagraph, whichever period is longer. The President shall designate each country the government of which has engaged in or tolerated violations described in this subparagraph as a country of particular concern for religious freedom.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Basis of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each review conducted under subparagraph (A) shall be based upon information contained in the latest Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the Annual Report, and on any other evidence available and shall take into account any findings or recommendations by the Commission with respect to the foreign country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any review under subparagraph (A) of a foreign country may take place singly or jointly with the review of one or more countries and may take place at any time prior to September 1 of the respective year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determinations of responsible parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the government of each country designated as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under paragraph (1)(A), the President shall seek to determine the agency or instrumentality thereof and the specific officials thereof that are responsible for the particularly severe violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by that government in order to appropriately target Presidential actions under this section in response.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Congressional notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the President designates a country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under paragraph (1)(A), the President shall, as soon as practicable after the designation is made, transmit to the appropriate congressional committees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the designation of the country, signed by the President; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Presidential actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">One or more of the Presidential actions described in paragraphs (9) through (15) of section 6445(a) of this title, as determined by the President.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substitution of binding agreements</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In lieu of carrying out action under paragraph (1), the President may conclude a binding agreement with the respective foreign government as described in section 6445(c) of this title. The existence of a binding agreement under this paragraph with a foreign government may be considered by the President prior to making any determination or taking any action under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Statutory construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to authorize the entry of the United States into an agreement covering matters outside the scope of violations of religious freedom.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authority for delay of Presidential actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on or before the date that the President is required (but for this paragraph) to take action under paragraph (1), the President determines and certifies to Congress that a single, additional period of time not to exceed 90 days is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for a continuation of negotiations that have been commenced with the government of that country to bring about a cessation of the violations by the foreign country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a continuation of multilateral negotiations into which the United States has entered to bring about a cessation of the violations by the foreign country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) for a review of corrective action taken by the foreign country after designation of such country as a country of particular concern; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in anticipation that corrective action will be taken by the foreign country during the 90-day period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the President shall not be required to take action until the expiration of that period of time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exception for ongoing Presidential action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall not be required to take action pursuant to this subsection in the case of a country of particular concern for religious freedom, if with respect to such country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the President has taken action pursuant to this chapter in a preceding year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such action is in effect at the time the country is designated as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the President reports to Congress the information described in section 6444(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this title regarding the actions in effect with respect to the country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) at the time the President determines a country to be a country of particular concern, if that country is already subject to multiple, broad-based sanctions imposed in significant part in response to human rights abuses, and such sanctions are ongoing, the President may determine that one or more of these sanctions also satisfies the requirements of this subsection. In a report to Congress pursuant to section 6444(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this title, and, as applicable, to section 6448 of this title, the President must designate the specific sanction or sanctions which he determines satisfy the requirements of this subsection. The sanctions so designated shall remain in effect subject to section 6449 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Statutory construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A determination under this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, that a foreign country has engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom shall not be construed to require the termination of assistance or other activities with respect to that country under any other provision of law, including section 2151n or 2304 of this title.</p>
