<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>State-determined lower federal share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of any project subject to paragraph (1), a State may determine a lower Federal share than the Federal share determined under such paragraph.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Federal share payable on any project in a State shall not exceed 95 percent of the total cost of any such project. In any case where a State elects to have the Federal share provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the State must enter into an agreement with the Secretary covering a period of not less than 1 year, requiring such State to use solely for purposes eligible for assistance under this title (other than paying its share of projects approved under this title) during the period covered by such agreement the difference between the State's share as provided in paragraph (2) and what its share would be if it elected to pay the share provided in paragraph (1) for all projects subject to such agreement. In the case of any project subject to this subsection, a State may determine a lower Federal share than the Federal share determined under the preceding sentences of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Increased Federal Share for Certain Safety Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal share payable on account of any project for traffic control signalization, safety rest areas, pavement marking, commuter carpooling and vanpooling, rail-highway crossing closure, or installation of traffic signs, traffic lights, guardrails, impact attenuators, concrete barrier endtreatments, breakaway utility poles, or priority control systems for emergency vehicles or transit vehicles at signalized intersections may amount to 100 percent of the cost of construction of such projects; except that not more than 10 percent of all sums apportioned for all the Federal-aid systems for any fiscal year in accordance with section 104 of this title shall be used under this subsection. In this subsection, the term &ldquo;safety rest area&rdquo; means an area where motor vehicle operators can park their vehicles and rest, where food, fuel, and lodging services are not available, and that is located on a segment of highway with respect to which the Secretary determines there is a shortage of public and private areas at which motor vehicle operators can park their vehicles and rest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may rely on a statement from the Secretary of the Interior as to the area of the lands referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to provide such statement annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal share payable on account of any repair or reconstruction provided for by funds made available under section 125 of this title on account of any project on a Federal-aid highway, including the Interstate System, shall not exceed the Federal share payable on a project on such system&nbsp;<sup><a href="#120_1_target" name="120_1">1</a></sup> as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section; except that (1) the Federal share payable for eligible emergency repairs to minimize damage, protect facilities, or restore essential traffic accomplished within 180 days after the actual occurrence of the natural disaster or catastrophic failure may amount to 100 percent of the costs thereof; and (2) the Federal share payable on account of any repair or reconstruction of forest highways, forest development roads and trails, park roads and trails, parkways, public lands highways, public lands development roads and trails, and Indian reservation roads may amount to 100 percent of the cost thereof. The total cost of a project may not exceed the cost of repair or reconstruction of a comparable facility. As used in this section with respect to bridges and in section 144 of this title, &ldquo;a comparable facility&rdquo; shall mean a facility which meets the current geometric and construction standards required for the types and volume of traffic which such facility will carry over its design life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary is authorized to cooperate with the State transportation departments and with the Department of the Interior in the construction of Federal-aid highways within Indian reservations and national parks and monuments under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior and to pay the amount assumed therefor from the funds apportioned in accordance with section 104 of this title to the State wherein the reservations and national parks and monuments are located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) At the request of any State, the Secretary may from time to time enter into agreements with such State to reimburse the State for the Federal share of the costs of preliminary and construction engineering at an agreed percentage of actual construction costs for each project, in lieu of the actual engineering costs for such project. The Secretary shall annually review each such agreement to insure that such percentage reasonably represents the engineering costs actually incurred by such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of this title, the Federal share payable on account of any project under this title in the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be 100 per centum of the total cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Increased Non-Federal Share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this title and subject to such criteria as the Secretary may establish, a State may contribute an amount in excess of the non-Federal share of a project under this title so as to decrease the Federal share payable on such project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Condition on receipt of credit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To receive a credit under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, a State shall enter into such agreement as the Secretary may require to ensure that the State will maintain its non-Federal transportation capital expenditures in such fiscal year at or above the average level of such expenditures for the preceding 3 fiscal years; except that if, for any 1 of the preceding 3 fiscal years, the non-Federal transportation capital expenditures of the State were at a level that was greater than 130 percent of the average level of such expenditures for the other 2 of the preceding 3 fiscal years, the agreement shall ensure that the State will maintain its non-Federal transportation capital expenditures in the fiscal year of the credit at or above the average level of such expenditures for the other 2 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Transportation capital expenditures defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In subparagraph (B), the term &ldquo;non-Federal transportation capital expenditures&rdquo; includes any payments made by the State for issuance of transportation-related bonds.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Use of Federal Land Management Agency Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the funds appropriated to any Federal land management agency may be used to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of any Federal-aid highway project the Federal share of which is funded under section 104.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) <cap-smallcap>Use of Federal Lands Highways Program Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out the Federal lands highways program under section 204 may be used to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of any project that is funded under section 104 and that provides access to or within Federal or Indian lands.</p>
