<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized, out of the funds appropriated for defense access roads, to <!-- PDFPage:184 -->provide for the construction and maintenance of defense access roads (including bridges, tubes, and tunnels thereon) to military reservations, to defense industries and defense industry sites, and to the sources of raw materials when such roads are certified to the Secretary as important to the national defense by the Secretary of Defense or such other official as the President may designate, and for replacing existing highways and highway connections that are shut off from the general public use by necessary closures or restrictions at military reservations and defense industry sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Funds appropriated for the purposes of this section shall be available, without regard to apportionment among the several States, for paying all or any part of the cost of the construction and maintenance of defense access roads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Funds appropriated for defense maneuvers and exercises, may be used by the Secretary in areas certified to him by the Secretary of Defense as maneuver areas for such construction, maintenance, and repair work as may be necessary to keep the highways therein, which have been or may be used for training of the Armed Forces, in suitable condition for such training purposes and for repairing the damage caused to such highways by the operations of men and equipment in such training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever any project for the construction of a circumferential highway around a city or of a radial intracity route thereto submitted by any State is certified by the Secretary of Defense, or such other official as the President may designate, as being important for civilian or military defense, such project may be constructed out of the funds heretofore or hereafter authorized to be appropriated for defense access roads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the Secretary shall determine that the State transportation department of any State is unable to obtain possession and the right to enter upon and use the required rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands, improved or unimproved, required for any project authorized by this section with sufficient promptness, the Secretary is authorized to acquire, enter upon, take possession thereof, and expend funds for projects thereon, prior to approval of title by the Attorney General, in the name of the United States, such rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands as may be required in such State for such projects by purchase, donation, condemnation, or otherwise in accordance with the laws of the United States (including the Act of February 26, 1931; 46 Stat. 1421).<sup><a href="#210_1_target" name="210_1">1</a></sup> The cost incurred by the Secretary in acquiring any such rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands may include the cost of examination and abstract of title, certificate of title, advertising, and any fees incidental to such acquisition; and shall be payable out of the funds available for paying the cost or the Federal share of the cost of the project for which such rights-of-way, lands, or interests in lands are acquired. The Secretary is further authorized and directed by proper deed executed in the name of the United States to convey any lands or interests in lands acquired in any State under the provisions of prior Acts or of this section to the State transportation department of such State or to such political subdivision thereof as its laws may provide, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State transportation department, or political subdivisions to which the conveyance is to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The provisions of section 112 of this title are applicable to defense access roads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If the Secretary shall determine that it is necessary for the expeditious completion of any defense access road project he may advance to any State out of funds appropriated for defense access roads transferred and available to the Department of Transportation the Federal share of the cost of construction thereof to enable the State transportation department to make prompt payments for acquisition of rights-of-way, and for the construction as it progresses. The sums so advanced shall be deposited in a special fund by the State official authorized by State law to receive such funds, to be disbursed solely upon vouchers approved by the State transportation department for rights-of-way which have been or are being acquired and for construction which has been actually performed under this section. Upon determination by the Secretary that funds advanced to any State under the provisions of this subsection are no longer required, the amount of the advance which is determined to be in excess of requirements for the project shall be repaid upon his demand, and such repayments shall be returned to the credit of the appropriation from which the funds were advanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Funds appropriated for the purposes of this section shall be available to pay the cost of repairing damage caused to highways by the operation of vehicles and equipment in the construction of classified military installations and facilities for ballistic missiles if the Secretary shall determine that the State transportation department of any State is, or has been, unable to prevent such damage by restrictions upon the use of such highways without interference with, or delay in, the completion of a contract for the construction of such military reservations or installations. This subsection shall apply notwithstanding any provision of contract holding a party thereto responsible for such damage, if the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall determine, in fact, that construction estimates and the bid of such party did not include allowance for repairing such damage. This subsection shall apply to damage caused by construction work commenced prior to June 1, 1961, and still in progress on that date and construction work which is commenced or for which a contract is awarded on or after June 1, 1961.</p>

Not to exceed one-third of the appropriation authorized for each fiscal year may be expended without requiring the country or countries in which such funds may be expended to match any part thereof, if the Secretary of State shall find that the cost of constructing said highway in such country or countries will be beyond their reasonable capacity to bear. The remainder of such authorized appropriations shall be available for expenditure only when matched to the extent required by this section by the country in which such expenditure may be made. Expenditures from the funds available on a matching basis shall not be made for the survey and construction of any portion of said highway within the borders of any country named herein unless such country shall provide and make available for expenditure in conjunction therewith a sum equal to at least one-third of the expenditures that may be incurred by that Government and the United States on such portion of the highway. All expenditures by the United States under the provisions of this section for material, equipment, and supplies shall, whenever practicable, be made for products of the United States or of the country in which such survey or construction work is being carried on. Construction work to be performed under contract shall be advertised for a reasonable period by the Minister of Public Works, or other similar official, of the government concerned in each of the participating countries and contracts shall be awarded pursuant to such advertisements with the approval of the Secretary. No part of the appropriations authorized shall be available for obligation or expenditure for work on said highway in any cooperating country unless the government of said country shall have assented to the provisions of this section; shall have furnished satisfactory assurances that it has an organization adequately qualified to administer the functions required of such country under the provisions hereof; and then only as such country may submit requests, from time to time, for the construction of any portion of the highway to standards adequate to meet present and future traffic needs. No part of said appropriations shall be available for obligation or expenditure in any such country until the government of that country shall have entered into an agreement with the United States which shall provide, in part, that said country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will provide, without participation of funds authorized, all necessary rights-of-way for the construction of said highway, which rights-of-way shall be of a minimum width where practicable of one hundred meters in rural areas and fifty meters in municipalities and shall forever be held inviolate as a part of the highway for public use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will not impose any highway toll, or permit any such toll to be charged, for use by vehicles or persons of any portion of said highway constructed under the provisions of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will not levy or assess, directly or indirectly, any fee, tax, or other charge for the use of said highway by vehicles or persons from the United States that does not apply equally to vehicles or persons of such country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will continue to grant reciprocal recognition of vehicle registration and drivers&rsquo; licenses in accordance with the provisions of the Convention for the Regulation of Inter-American Automotive Traffic, which was opened for signature at the Pan American Union in Washington on December 15, 1943, and to which such country and the United States are parties, or of any other treaty or international convention establishing similar reciprocal recognition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) will provide for the maintenance of said highway after its completion in condition adequately to serve the needs of present and future traffic.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The survey and construction work authorized by this section shall be under the administration of the Secretary, who shall consult with the appropriate officials of the Department of State with respect to matters involving the foreign relations of this Government, and such negotiations with the Governments of the American Republics named in subsection (a) of this section as may be required to carry out the purposes of this section shall be conducted through, or as authorized by, the Department of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this section shall not create nor authorize the creation of any obligations on the part of the Government of the United States with respect to any expenditures for highway construction or survey heretofore or hereafter undertaken in any of the countries enumerated in subsection (a) of this section, other than the expenditures authorized by the provisions of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:186 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) Appropriations made pursuant to any authorizations heretofore, or hereafter enacted for the Inter-American Highway shall be considered available for expenditure by the Secretary for necessary administrative and engineering expenses in connection with the Inter-American Highway program.</p>
