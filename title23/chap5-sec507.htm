<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop indicators of economic, social, and environmental performance of transportation systems to facilitate analysis of potential alternatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to study the relationship between highway density and ecosystem integrity, including the impacts of highway density on habitat integrity and overall ecosystem health, and develop a rapid assessment methodology for use by transportation and regulatory agencies in determining the relationship between highway density and ecosystem integrity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to meet additional priorities as determined by the advisory board established under subsection (c), including recommendations of the National Research Council in the report entitled &ldquo;Environmental Research Needs in Transportation&rdquo;.</p>
