<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Finding and Declaration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds and declares that it is in the vital interest of the United States that a highway bridge program be carried out to enable States to improve the condition of their highway bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads through replacement and rehabilitation of bridges that the States and the Secretary determine are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and through systematic preventive maintenance of bridges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1) inventory all those highway bridges on any Federal-aid system which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads; (2) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use; (3) based on that classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation; and (4) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1) inventory all those highway bridges on public roads, other than those on any Federal-aid system, which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads, (2) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, (3) based on the classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation and (4) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may, at the request of a State, inventory bridges, on and off the Federal-aid system, for historic significance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Inventory of indian reservation and park bridges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As part of the activities carried out under paragraph (1), the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall (A) inventory all those highway bridges on Indian reservation roads and park roads which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads, (B) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, (C) based on the classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation, and (D) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Participation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Bridge replacement and rehabilitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application by a State or States to the Secretary for assistance for a highway bridge that has been determined to be eligible for replacement or rehabilitation under subsection (b) or (c), the Secretary may approve Federal participation in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) replacing the bridge with a comparable facility; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) rehabilitating the bridge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Types of assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On application by a State or States to the Secretary, the Secretary may approve Federal assistance for any of the following activities for a highway bridge that has been determined to be eligible for replacement or rehabilitation under subsection (b) or (c):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Painting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Seismic retrofit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Systematic preventive maintenance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Installation of scour countermeasures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Application of calcium magnesium acetate, sodium acetate/formate, or other environmentally acceptable, minimally corrosive anti-icing and de-icing compositions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Basis for determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall determine the eligibility of highway bridges for replacement or rehabilitation for each State based on structurally deficient and functionally obsolete highway bridges in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for preventive maintenance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a State may carry out a project under paragraph (2)(B), (2)(C), or (2)(D) for a highway bridge without regard to whether the bridge is eligible for replacement or rehabilitation under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Funds authorized to carry out this section shall be apportioned among the several States on October 1 of the fiscal year for which authorized in accordance with this subsection. Each deficient bridge shall be placed into one of the following categories: (1) Federal-aid system bridges eligible for replacement, (2) Federal-aid system bridges eligible for rehabilitation, (3) off-system bridges eligible for replacement, and (4) off-system bridges eligible for rehabilitation. The deck area of deficient bridges in each category shall be multiplied by the respective unit price on a State-by-State basis, as determined by the Secretary; and the total cost in each State divided by the total cost of the deficient bridges in all States shall determine the apportionment factors. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if a State transfers funds apportioned to the State under this section in a fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1997, to any other apportionment of funds to such State under this title, the total cost of deficient bridges in such State and in all States to be determined for the <!-- PDFPage:163 -->succeeding fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of such transferred funds. No State shall receive more than 10 per centum or less than 0.25 per centum of the total apportionment for any one fiscal year. The Secretary shall make these determinations based upon the latest available data, which shall be updated annually. Funds apportioned under this section shall be available for expenditure for the period specified in section 118(b)(2). Any funds not obligated at the expiration of such period shall be reapportioned by the Secretary to the other States in accordance with this subsection. The use of funds authorized under this section to carry out a project for the seismic retrofit of a bridge shall not affect the apportionment of funds under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Federal share payable on account of any project under this section shall be 80 per centum of the cost thereof.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the General Bridge Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 525&ndash;533) shall apply to bridges authorized to be replaced, in whole or in part, by this section, except that subsection (b) of section 502 of such Act of 1946 and section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151) shall not apply to any bridge constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or replaced with assistance under this title, if such bridge is over waters (1) which are not used and are not susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce, and (2) which are (a) not tidal, or (b) if tidal, used only by recreational boating, fishing, and other small vessels less than 21 feet in length.</p>

Before authorizing an expenditure of funds under this subsection, the Secretary shall determine that the applicant agency has insufficient reserves, surpluses, and projected revenues (over and above those required for bridge and transit capital and operating costs) to fund the necessary bridge replacement or rehabilitation project. Any non-Federal funds expended for the seismic retrofit of the bridge may be credited toward the non-Federal share required as a condition of receipt of any Federal funds for seismic retrofit of the bridge made available after the date of the expenditure.</p>
