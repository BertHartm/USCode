<p class="statutory-body">(a) If the Secretary shall determine that it is necessary for the expeditious completion of projects on any of the Federal-aid systems, including the Interstate System, he may advance to any State out of any existing appropriations the Federal share of the cost of construction thereof to enable the State highway department to make prompt payments for acquisition of rights-of-way, and for the construction as it progresses. The sums so advanced shall be deposited in a special revolving trust fund, by the State official authorized under the laws of the State to receive Federal-aid highway funds, to be disbursed solely upon vouchers approved by the State highway department for rights-of-way which have been or are being acquired, and for construction which has been actually performed and approved by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter. Upon determination by the Secretary that any part of the funds advanced to any State under the provisions of this section are no longer required, the amount of the advance, which is determined to be in excess of current requirements of the State, shall be repaid upon his demand, and such repayments shall be returned to the credit of the appropriation from which the funds were advanced. Any sum advanced and not repaid on demand shall be deducted from sums due the State for the Federal pro rata share of the cost of construction of Federal-aid projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that any toll bridge, toll tunnel, or approach thereto, which meets the requirements of section 129 of this title is necessary to complete an essential gap in the Interstate System then, upon request of the State highway department, the Secretary shall, at any time during construction of such bridge, tunnel, or approach and for one year after it is opened to traffic, and subject to the conditions and limitations of such section 129, advance to such State 100 per centum of the cost of construction of such bridge, tunnel, or approach. So much of the amount so <!-- PDFPage:78 -->advanced that exceeds the Federal share of such construction cost shall be repaid to the United States as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 50 per centum within one year of the date such bridge, tunnel, or approach is opened to traffic,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 25 per centum within two years of such date of opening, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) 25 per centum within three years of such date of opening.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any advance made to a State under this subsection shall be from the funds apportioned to said State for the Interstate System. So much of any advance made to a State under this subsection required to be repaid shall be repaid with interest at a rate determined by the Secretary. If a State receives any advance under this subsection with respect to any toll bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto, then the provisions of section 103(e)(4) of this title shall not apply to such bridge, tunnel, or approach.</p>
