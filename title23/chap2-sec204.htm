<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Recognizing the need for all Federal roads which are public roads to be treated under the same uniform policies as roads which are on the Federal-aid systems, there is established a coordinated Federal lands highways program which shall consist of the public lands highways, park roads, parkways, and Indian reservation roads as defined in section 101 of this title. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall develop appropriate transportation planning procedures and safety, bridge, and pavement management systems for roads funded under the Federal Lands Highway Program. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, no public lands highway project may be undertaken in any State pursuant to this section unless the State concurs in the selection and planning of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Funds available for public lands highways shall be used by the Secretary to pay for the cost of planning, research, engineering and construction thereof. Funds available for park roads, parkways, and Indian reservation roads <!-- PDFPage:142 -->shall be used by the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior to pay for the cost of construction and improvement thereof. In connection therewith, the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate, may enter into construction contracts and such other contracts with a State or civil subdivision thereof or Indian tribe as deemed advisable. In the case of Indian reservation roads, Indian labor may be employed in such construction and improvement under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior. No ceiling on Federal employment shall be applicable to construction or improvement of Indian reservation roads. Funds available for each class of Federal lands highways shall be available for any kind of transportation project eligible for assistance under this title that is within or adjacent to or provides access to the areas served by the particular class of Federal lands highways. The Secretary of Interior may reserve funds from the Bureau of Indian Affairs&rsquo; administrative funds associated with the Indian reservation roads program to finance the Indian technical centers authorized under section 326.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Before approving as a project on an Indian reservation road any project eligible for funds apportioned under section 104 or section 144 of this title in a State, the Secretary must determine that the obligation of funds for such project is supplementary to and not in lieu of the obligation, for projects on Indian reservation roads, of a fair and equitable share of funds apportioned to such State under section 104 of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, Indian reservation roads under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior shall be eligible to expend not more than 15 percent funds&nbsp;<sup><a href="#204_1_target" name="204_1">1</a></sup> apportioned for Indian reservation roads from the Highway Trust Fund for the purpose of road sealing projects. The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall continue to retain responsibility, including annual funding request responsibility, for road maintenance programs on Indian reservations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Cooperation of States, counties, or other local subdivisions may be accepted in construction and improvement, and any funds received from a State, county, or local subdivision shall be credited to appropriations available for the class of Federal lands highways to which such funds were contributed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Construction of each project shall be performed by contract awarded by competitive bidding, unless the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior shall affirmatively find that, under the circumstances relating to such project, some other method is in the public interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of section 23 of the &ldquo;Buy Indian&rdquo; Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 891), and the provisions of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (88 Stat. 2205) shall apply to all funds administered by the Secretary of the Interior which are appropriated for the construction and improvement of Indian reservation roads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) All appropriations for the construction and improvement of each class of Federal lands highways shall be administered in conformity with regulations and agreements jointly approved by the Secretary and the Secretary of the appropriate Federal land managing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary shall transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture from appropriations for forest highways such amounts as may be needed to cover necessary administrative expenses of the Forest Service in connection with forest highways.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Eligible Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Funds available for each class of Federal lands highways may be available for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Transportation planning for tourism and recreational travel including the National Forest Scenic Byways Program, Bureau of Land Management Back Country Byways Program, National Trail System Program, and other similar Federal programs that benefit recreational development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Adjacent vehicular parking areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Interpretive signage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Acquisition of necessary scenic easements and scenic or historic sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Provision for pedestrians and bicycles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Construction and reconstruction of roadside rest areas including sanitary and water facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Other appropriate public road facilities such as visitor centers as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Transfers to Secretary of the Interior</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall transfer to the Secretary of the Interior from the appropriation for public land highways amounts as may be needed to cover necessary administrative costs of the Bureau of Land Management in connection with public lands highways.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Indian Reservation Roads Planning</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Up to 2 percent of funds made available for Indian reservation roads for each fiscal year shall be allocated to those Indian tribal governments applying for transportation planning pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Indian tribal government, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, and, as may be appropriate, with a State, local government, or metropolitan planning organization, shall develop a transportation improvement program, that includes all Indian reservation road projects proposed for funding. Projects shall be selected by the Indian tribal government from the transportation improvement program and shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary.</p>
