<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever an apportionment is made of the sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure on the surface transportation program, the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, the National Highway System, and the Interstate System, the Secretary shall deduct a sum, in such amount not to exceed 33/4 per centum of all sums so authorized as the Secretary may deem necessary for administering the provisions of law to be financed from appropriations for the Federal-aid systems and for carrying on the research authorized by subsections (a) and (b) of section 307 of this title. In making such determination, the Secretary shall take into account the unexpended balance of any sums deducted for such purposes in prior years. The sum so deducted shall be available for expenditure from the unexpended balance of any appropriation made at any time for expenditure upon the Federal-aid systems, until such sum has been expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) On October 1, of each fiscal year except as provided in paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection, the Secretary, after making the deduction authorized by subsection (a) of this section and the set asides authorized by subsection (f) of this section and section 307 of this title, shall apportion the remainder of the sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure on the surface transportation program, the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, the National Highway System, and the Interstate System for that fiscal year, among the several States in the following manner:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>National highway system</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the National Highway System 1 percent to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and the <!-- PDFPage:32 -->remaining 99 percent apportioned in the same ratio as funds are apportioned under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, in the ratio which the weighted nonattainment area population of each State bears to the total weighted nonattainment area population of all States. The weighted nonattainment area population shall be calculated by multiplying the population of each area within any State that was a nonattainment area (as defined in section 171(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7501(2))) for ozone during any part of fiscal year 1994 by a factor of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 1.0 if the area is classified as a marginal ozone nonattainment area under subpart 2 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 1.1 if the area is classified as a moderate ozone nonattainment area under such subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 1.2 if the area is classified as a serious ozone nonattainment area under such subpart;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 1.3 if the area is classified as a severe ozone nonattainment area under such subpart; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) 1.4 if the area is classified as an extreme ozone nonattainment area under such subpart.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the area was also classified under subpart 3 of part D of title I of such Act as a nonattainment area for carbon monoxide during any part of fiscal year 1994, for purposes of calculating the weighted nonattainment area population, the weighted nonattainment area population of the area, as determined under the preceding provisions of this paragraph, shall be further multiplied by a factor of 1.2. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph, in the case of States with a total 1990 census population of 15,000,000 or greater, the amount apportioned under this paragraph in a fiscal year to all of such States in the aggregate, shall be distributed among such States based on their relative populations; except that none of such States shall be distributed more than 42 percent of the aggregate amount so apportioned to all of such States. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, each State shall receive a minimum apportionment of 1/2 of 1 percent of the funds apportioned under this paragraph. The Secretary shall use estimates prepared by the Secretary of Commerce when determining population figures.</p>
