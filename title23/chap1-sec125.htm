In no event shall funds be used pursuant to this section for the repair or reconstruction of bridges which have been permanently closed to all vehicular traffic by the State or responsible local official because of imminent danger of collapse due to structural deficiencies or physical deterioration. Subject to the following limitations, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund such sums as may be necessary to establish the fund authorized by this section and to replenish it on an annual basis: (1) Not more than $50,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any fiscal year ending before July 1, 1972, and not more than $100,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any one fiscal year commencing after June 30, 1972, and ending before June 1, 1976, to carry out the provisions of this section and an additional amount not to exceed $100,000,000 is further authorized to be expended in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, to carry out the provisions of this section, and not more than $25,000,000 for the three-month period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, is authorized to be expended to carry out the provisions of this section, and not more than $100,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any one fiscal year commencing after September 30, 1976, and not more than $100,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any one fiscal year commencing after September 30, 1980, to carry out the provisions of this section, except that, if in any fiscal year the total of all expenditures under this section is less than the amount authorized to be expended in such fiscal year, the unexpended balance of such amount shall remain available for expenditure during the next two succeeding fiscal years in addition to amounts otherwise available to carry out this section in such years, and (2) prior to the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, 60 per centum of the expenditures under this section for any fiscal year are authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund and the remaining 40 per centum of such expenditures are authorized to be appropriated only from any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and for any fiscal year thereafter, 100 per centum of such expenditures are authorized to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund. For the purposes of this section the period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, shall be deemed to be a part of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1977. Pending such appropriation or replenishment the Secretary may expend from any funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this title, including existing Federal-aid appropriations, such sums as may be necessary for the immediate prosecution of the work herein authorized, such appropriations to be reimbursed from the appropriations herein authorized when made.</p>
