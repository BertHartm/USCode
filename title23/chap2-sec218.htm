Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any obligation limitation enacted for fiscal year 1983 or for any other fiscal year thereafter, including any portion of any other fiscal year thereafter, prior to the date of the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century shall not apply to projects authorized by the preceding sentence. No expenditures shall be made for the construction of the portion of such highways that are in Canada until an agreement has been reached by the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States which shall provide, in part, that the Canadian Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will provide, without participation of funds authorized under this title, all necessary right-of-way for the reconstruction of such highways;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will not impose any highway toll, or permit any such toll to be charged for the use of such highways by vehicles or persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will not levy or assess, directly or indirectly, any fee, tax, or other charge for the use of such highways by vehicles or persons from the United States that does not apply equally to vehicles or persons of Canada;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will continue to grant reciprocal recognition of vehicle registration and drivers&rsquo; licenses in accordance with agreements between the United States and Canada; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) will maintain such highways after their completion in proper condition adequately to serve the needs of present and future traffic.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The survey and construction work undertaken in Canada pursuant to this section shall be under the general supervision of the Secretary.</p>
