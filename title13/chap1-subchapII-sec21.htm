<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., &sect;2 (Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, &sect;3, 32 Stat. 51; June 18, 1929, ch. 28, &sect;21, 46 Stat. 26). The provision of section 2 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., <!-- PDFPage:9 -->which imposed upon the Director the duty to superintend and direct the taking of censuses of the United States was omitted in view of 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, effective May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred all functions of all officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and this title, as revised, vests such duty in the Secretary. However, under section 4 of this title, he may delegate his functions hereunder.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Bureau&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;permanent Census Office&rdquo;. See Revision Note to section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">At the end of this section, references to regulations, and to orders of the Secretary, were added after &ldquo;law&rdquo; in view of the changes effected by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, referred to above.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
