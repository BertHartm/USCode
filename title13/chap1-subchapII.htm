The provision of section 2 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which imposed upon the Director the duty to superintend and direct the taking of censuses of the United States was omitted in view of 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, effective May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred all functions of all officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and this title, as revised, vests such duty in the Secretary. However, under section 4 of this title, he may delegate his functions hereunder.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Bureau&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;permanent Census Office&rdquo;. See Revision Note to section 2 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., &sect;&sect;203, 216, and section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, &sect;&sect;3, 16, 46 Stat. 21, 25; July 6, 1949, ch. 298, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 63 Stat. 406; July 15, 1949, ch. 338, title VI, &sect;607, 63 Stat. 441; Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, title XI, &sect;1106(a), 63 Stat. 972; July 16, 1952, ch. 912, 66 Stat. 736).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates parts of sections 203 and 216 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with that part of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such sections 203 and 216 applicable to the censuses of housing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of manufacturers, the mineral industries, transportation, and other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), and section 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of governments (see subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title), made section 203 of such title applicable to those censuses. However, since the particular provisions of such section 203 that have been carried into this revised section apparently related, as supplemented by section 1442(b) of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the decennial censuses provided for in sections 201 et seq. of such title, and in such section 1442 of title 42 (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title), and apparently could have no relevancy to the quinquennial censuses referred to above, this revised section relates only to such decennial censuses.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), &ldquo;Departmental Service&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;District of Columbia&rdquo;, since the Bureau of the Census now has its headquarters in Maryland, and not in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this section, a reference to the Bureau of the Census was changed to a reference to the Department of Commerce, and references to the Director of the Census <!-- PDFPage:10 -->were changed in all but one case to references to the Secretary (of Commerce) to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, &sect;&sect;1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title. The provision of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that appointments under the particular provisions thereof that have been carried into subsection (a) of this revised section should be made upon the recommendation of the Director of the Census, have been omitted from such subsection (a) for the same reason. Further, words &ldquo;or to whatever other officer is designated by the Secretary to take the census provided for in sections 141 and 142 of this title&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;Director of the Census&rdquo; in par. (1) of subsection (a), to conform with such 1950 Reorganization Plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first paragraph of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which provided for the employment of two assistant directors for each decennial census period, was omitted as obsolete and superseded, in view of section 122 of such title, which made such section 203 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures and other businesses, and to surveys (see subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this title), thus rendering such first paragraph ineffective and meaningless. See also section 121(b) of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third proviso in the second paragraph of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., giving preference in appointments to disabled war veterans, their widows, and, under certain circumstances, to their wives, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Veterans&rsquo; Preference Act of 1944 (chapter 17 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees).</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Remainder of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., is incorporated in this subchapter, and for remainder of section 216 thereof, and of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may utilize the services of nontemporary employees of the Bureau (by assignment, promotion, appointment, detail, or otherwise) in temporary positions established for any census, for not to exceed the period during which appropriations are available for that census. Whenever the Secretary determines that the services of an employee which have been utilized under this section are no longer required in such a temporary position, he may, without regard to the provisions of any other law, return the employee to a continuing position, with rank and compensation not less than that which he held in his last permanent position in the Bureau: <em>Provided</em>, That no employee shall, by reason of his service in a temporary position under this subsection, lose the protection of any law or regulation with respect to his separation, suspension, furlough, or reduction in rank or compensation below the level held in his last permanent position in the Bureau. Service by a nontemporary employee in a temporary position under this subsection shall be creditable for step-increases (both periodic and longevity) under title VII of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, as though it were a continuation of service in his last permanent position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) As used in this title with respect to appointments or positions, &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; shall be construed to mean not in excess of one year, or not in excess of the specific period during which appropriations are available for the conduct of a particular census, whichever is longer. No employee of the Bureau who holds only a temporary appointment within the meaning of this section shall be considered as other than strictly temporary for purposes of any other provision of law relating to separations, suspensions, or reductions in rank or compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The enlisted men and officers of the uniformed services may be appointed and compensated for service in temporary enumerator positions for the enumeration of personnel of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may fix compensation on a piece-price basis without limitation as to the amount earned per diem, and payments may be made to enumerators for the use of private automobiles on official business without regard to section 4 of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, as amended (5 U.S.C. 837), but at rates not in excess of the rates provided by that Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may authorize the expenditure of necessary sums for travel expenses of persons selected for appointment for attendance at training courses held by the Department of Commerce with respect to any of the work provided for by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law prohibiting the expenditure of public money for telephone service, the Secretary, under such regulations as he shall prescribe, may authorize reimbursement for tolls or charges for telephone service from private residences or private apartments to the extent such charges are determined by the Secretary to have been incurred to facilitate the collection of information in connection with the censuses and surveys authorized by this title.</p>
