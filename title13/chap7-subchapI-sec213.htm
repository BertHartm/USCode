<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., &sect;&sect;122, 208, 252, and section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, &sect;8, 46 Stat. 23; June 19, 1948, ch. 502, &sect;2, 62 Stat. 479; July 15, 1949, ch. 338, title VI, &sect;607, 63 Stat. 441; Sept. 7, 1950, ch. 910, &sect;2, 64 Stat. 784).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates part of section 208 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with that part of section 122 of such title which made such section 208 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufacturers, the mineral industries, and other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), that part of section 252 of such title which made such section 208 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of governments (see subchapter III of chapter 5 of this revised title), and that part of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such section 208 applicable to the decennial censuses of housing (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title). For remainder of sections 122, 208, and 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which section has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">As set out in this revised section, the provisions relate to all investigations, surveys, collections of statistics, and censuses provided for in this title, and to officers as well as employees, which was probably the original legislative intent.</p>

<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.</p>
