May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred all functions of all officers and employees, agencies and bureaus of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary. However, the Secretary, under that plan, may delegate any of such transferred functions, as well as any other of his functions, to any of such officers, employees, agencies and bureaus. See, also, section 4 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference in section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the year &ldquo;1949&rdquo; as the year for commencement of the quinquennial censuses was changed to the year &ldquo;1954&rdquo;, since the former designation is obsolete, and the provision of such section that the census of manufacturers should not be taken in 1949 was omitted as obsolete.</p>
