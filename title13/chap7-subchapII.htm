<p class="note-body">Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., &sect;&sect;122, 209 (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, &sect;9, 46 Stat. 23; June 19, 1948, ch. 502, &sect;2, 62 Stat. 479).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates the second paragraph of section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which was a part of chapter 4 of that title relating to censuses of population, agriculture, etc., with that part of section 122 of such title which made such section 209 applicable to the interim surveys provided for by section 121(b) of such title (see subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this revised title). For remainder of such sections 122 and 209, see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., made section 209 of such title applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures, the mineral industries, and other businesses provided for by section 121(a) thereof (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), and applicable, with certain qualifications and exceptions, to the interim surveys, which section 121(b) thereof provided for, not only with respect to those censuses but also the censuses provided for in &ldquo;other Acts&rdquo; (chapter 5 of this title). However, the particular provisions of such section 209 that have been carried into this revised section related only to population enumerations, and this section has accordingly been restricted to the population censuses authorized under subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title, and to the interim surveys authorized under subchapter IV of such chapter only in so far as they relate to population enumerations. The exceptions and qualifications with respect to the application of this section to such interim surveys are set out elsewhere in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to &ldquo;any officer or employee&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;any supervisor, supervisor's clerk, enumerator, interpreter, special agent, or other officer or employee&rdquo;, as the latter enumeration of the types of employees is unnecessary and redundant; and &ldquo;Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;Census Office&rdquo;, to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, &sect;&sect;1, 2, effective May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., The Public Health and Welfare (which section has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), made section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., applicable to the censuses of housing (subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title). However, the particular provisions of such section 209 that have been carried into this revised section, could not, by their terms, be relevant to housing censuses, hence no reference is made in this section to such censuses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words in section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., &ldquo;either as to the number of persons resident in any district or community, or in any other respect&rdquo;, were omitted from the revised section as unnecessary and superfluous.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to the offense described as a &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; was omitted as covered by section 1 of title 18, U.S.C., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, classifying offenses; and words &ldquo;and upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., made section 209 of such title applicable to the interim surveys (provided for by section 121(b) thereof) not only with respect to the censuses of manufacturers, the mineral industries, and other businesses provided for by section 121(a) thereof, but also with respect to the censuses provided for by &ldquo;other Acts&rdquo; (chapter 5 of this title). However, section 252 of that title, which was a part of a chapter thereof relating to the quinquennial censuses of governments (subchapter III of chapter 5 of this revised title), in making certain sections of chapter 4 thereof applicable to such censuses, did not specify such section 209. Therefore, this revised section is not made so applicable, either to the censuses of governments provided for in subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title, or to surveys provided for in subchapter IV thereof in so far as such surveys relate to governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language of section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., providing that it should &ldquo;be the duty&rdquo; of every owner, proprietor, etc., to furnish the described information or assistance was omitted as unnecessary and redundant.

<p class="note-body">The enumeration of the different types of employees, in section 209 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., &ldquo;supervisor, enumerator,&rdquo;, etc., was omitted as unnecessary and covered by the reference in this revised section to &ldquo;officer or employee&rdquo;.</p>

For remainder of sections 74, 84 and 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which section has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., by its own terms was applicable to the collection of miscellaneous statistics provided for by section 111 of such title (subchapter III of chapter 3 of this revised title), except that such section 111 placed certain restrictions upon the collection of statistics on religion. These restrictions, along with those of section 122 of such title with respect to the making of surveys, and along with provisions excepting this section from application to the censuses of governments provided for by section 251 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (subchapter III of chapter 5 of this revised title), are set out as another section in this revised title. Subject to those exceptions and restrictions, this section applies to all collections and censuses provided for in this title, in so far as it is relevant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 74, 84 and 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., described the same type of offenses, but the penal provisions varied. Section 74 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 and maximum imprisonment of one year, for refusal to answer or giving a false answer; section 84 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 for refusal to answer or giving false answer, with no imprisonment; and section 210 prescribed maximum fine of $500 and maximum imprisonment of sixty days for refusal to answer, and maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum imprisonment of one year for giving a false answer. In addition, such section 74 prescribed a minimum fine of $300 for refusal to answer or giving a false answer. This revised section adopts the penalties of such section 210, which was the latest enactment on the subject, and which might have been regarded as having superseded the penal provisions of such sections 74 and 84. According to its own terms, its penal provisions were applicable not only to the censuses of population, agriculture, etc., provided for in chapter 4 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., but also to any schedules prepared under the act of March 6, 1902 (sections 1&ndash;6, 77, 101, 111, and 112 of such title), or under acts amendatory thereof &ldquo;or supplemental thereto.&rdquo; This reference did not cover sections 74 and 84 specifically, but such sections, enacted in 1924 and 1916, respectively, could probably be regarded as having been &ldquo;supplemental&rdquo; to the 1902 act. In any event, this revised section establishes uniform penalties for refusal to answer, or giving a false answer in the circumstances stated. Further, the prescribed penalties are the maximum, and any lesser penalty can be imposed if the facts of the case warrant it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to the &ldquo;Secretary [of Commerce] or other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof&rdquo; was substituted for references to the Director of the Census and employees of the Bureau of the Census, to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, &sect;&sect;1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">References to the offenses as being in each case a &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; were omitted as covered by section 1 of title 18, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, classifying crimes; and words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; and &ldquo;at the discretion of the court&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision permitting the requests to be made by registered mail, by telegraph, by visiting representative, or by one or more of these methods, was contained in sections 74 and 84 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., but not in section 210 of such title. It is retained in this section as probably a desirable provision to apply generally.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions in sections 74, 84 and 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that it &ldquo;shall be the duty&rdquo; of the persons referred to, to answer correctly, etc., were omitted as unnecessary and redundant. This section defines offenses and prescribes penalties for committing them, and are deemed sufficient for the purpose of enforcement. However, some of the language used in the omitted provisions was necessarily included in the description of the offenses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., &sect;&sect;111, 122 (Mar. 2, 1902, ch. 139, &sect;7, 32 Stat. 52; June 7, 1906, ch. 3048, 34 Stat. 218; June 18, 1929, ch. 28, &sect;3, 46 Stat. 26; 1939 Reorg.

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates parts of sections 111 and 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect consolidation and to preserve the intent, scope and meaning of the parts of such sections so consolidated. For remainder of such sections 111 and 122, see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (a) and (b) of this revised section are from section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and in subsection (a) references to the Secretary (of Commerce) and to &ldquo;other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof&rdquo; were substituted for references to the Director of the Census to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, &sect;&sect;1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is partly new (but preserves existing law), and partly from section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. Section 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to the censuses of governments provided by section 251 thereof (see subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title), made certain sections in chapter 4 of that title relating to censuses of population, agriculture, etc., applicable to such censuses of governments. However, it did not list sections 209 and 210 of such title among the sections made so applicable, probably because they would hardly be relevant and capable of application to such censuses. Subsection (c) makes it clear that sections 221&ndash;224 of this revised title, into which were carried the provisions of such sections 209 and 210, and which speak in general terms, are not applicable to the censuses and surveys of governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is from section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. Words in this subsection, &ldquo;a refusal, in such circumstances, to furnish such information shall not be an offense under this chapter&rdquo;, read &ldquo;such information shall not be required&rdquo;. It was felt that such exception in such section 111 was actually more in the nature of an exception to the penal provisions, and it has been so treated in this revised title. The collection of statistics on religion are provided for in section 102 of this title.</p>
