<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (2) and (9)&ndash;(17) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. Where established uses conflict, a choice has been made.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (1), the definition of &ldquo;Territory&rdquo; in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (2), a definition of &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; is inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (3)(A), the words &ldquo;a land force&rdquo; are substituted for 32:2. The National Defense Act of 1916, &sect;117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, &sect;3, 43 Stat. 1081.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (3) and (4), the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo; is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (3) and (5), the words &ldquo;unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires&mdash;&rdquo; and &ldquo;as provided in this title&rdquo;, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (3)(B) and (5)(B), the words &ldquo;has its officers appointed&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;officered&rdquo;, in 32:4b.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (4) and (6), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5)(A), the words &ldquo;an air force&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law&rdquo;, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (less applicability to Army National Guard), to make the definition of &ldquo;Air National Guard&rdquo; parallel with the definition of &ldquo;Army National Guard&rdquo;, and to make explicit the intent of Congress in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), words showing how enlisted members became such are inserted to make clear that enlist<!-- PDFPage:4 -->ment is not the only method of becoming a member in an enlisted grade.</p>
