<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;ceases to have the qualifications prescribed under section 300 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for 32:154 (last 26 words of last par.), since it is implicit that a member who could not be paid would lose his federally recognized status (see JAGA 1953/9033, 3 Dec. 1953). The last 23 words of subsection (a) are inserted as a necessary implication of the rule stated in section 309(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;or warrant officer&rdquo; are omitted, since section 101(9) of this title defines &ldquo;officer&rdquo; to include warrant officers. The word &ldquo;detailed&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;appointed&rdquo;, since the filling of the positions involved is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word &ldquo;commissioned&rdquo; is inserted after the words &ldquo;composed of&rdquo;, since the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; alone, in 32:115, referred to a commissioned officer only (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)). The words &ldquo;who outrank him&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;senior in rank to the officer under investigation&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the opening clause is substituted for the words &ldquo;such transfer&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;his Federal recognition is withdrawn&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall terminate his federally recognized National Guard or Air National Guard status&rdquo;.</p>
