<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), 32:68 (last sentence) is omitted as surplusage, since positive provisions relating to the assignment or detail of retired officers to that duty are covered by section 3504(a) or 8504(a) of title 10. The words &ldquo;of the active list&rdquo;, in 32:68, are omitted for the same reason. The words &ldquo;so detailed&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;detailed under section 68 of this title&rdquo;, in 32:69. The words &ldquo;relative or lineal&rdquo;, in 32:69, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
