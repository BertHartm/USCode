<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;within their respective borders&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;Regular Army&rdquo;, since the Army is the category for which the organization is prescribed, and the Regular Army is a personnel category for which no organization is prescribed. Similarly, the words &ldquo;Air Force&rdquo; are used instead of the words &ldquo;Regular Air Force&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;by branch of the Army or organization of the Air Force&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;as to branch or arm of service&rdquo;.

<p class="note-body">In subsections (d) and (e) the word &ldquo;commissioned&rdquo; is inserted, since 32:8 and 10 historically applied only to commissioned officers (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the word &ldquo;brigades&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage.</p>
