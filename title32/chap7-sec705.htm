<p class="note-body">The reference to 10:1106 is omitted, since that section related only to sales of uniforms and equipment to cadets at the United States Military Academy. The reference to 10:904 is omitted as covered by the language of the revised section. The words &ldquo;at average current costs, including overhead, as determined by the Secretary concerned&rdquo; are inserted to reflect sections 4621 and 9621 of title 10, which apply to all sales of individual clothing and equipment. The words &ldquo;articles of individual clothing and equipment&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;uniforms, accouterments, and equipment&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;active and inactive&rdquo;, &ldquo;on proper identification&rdquo;, and &ldquo;rules and&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
