<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;not in Federal service&rdquo; are inserted to show that the revised section applies only to joint exercises involving National Guard troops not in Federal service, since 32:72 was enacted before the establishment of the National Guard of the United States, in <!-- PDFPage:22 -->1933. The words &ldquo;troops in Federal service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;troops of the United States&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;officers in Federal service who command&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;commander of the United States troops&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;post, air base, or other place&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;military post, or reservation, or elsewhere&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;that place and the Federal troops on duty there&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;there or elsewhere&rdquo; The words &ldquo;including outdoor target practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;field and coast defense instruction&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
