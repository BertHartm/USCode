The second sentence is inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;successfully&rdquo;, &ldquo;final determination of his eligibility for, and&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the grade concerned&rdquo;, and &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. 50:1114 (proviso of last sentence) is omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;To be eligible for temporary Federal recognition under subsection (a), a person&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;However, a temporary extension of Federal recognition shall be granted only when the officer&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;the period of temporary recognition&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;such recognition&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;and obligations required of him&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the same grade&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
