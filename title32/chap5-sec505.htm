<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;branch of the Army corresponding&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;same arm, corps, or department&rdquo;, to conform to sections 3063 and 3064 of title 10. In the second sentence, the words &ldquo;organization of the Air Force corresponding&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;same arm, corps, or department&rdquo;, since the Air Force is not organized by statute into branches, arms, corps, or departments. The word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers, warrant officers, and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;service school&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;military-service school of the United States&rdquo;. Reference to the United States Air Force Academy is inserted to reflect its establishment by the Air Force Academy Act (63 Stat. 47).</p>
