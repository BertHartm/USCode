<h3 class="section-head">Rule 52. Findings by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Effect.</strong> In all actions tried upon the facts, the court shall find the facts specially and state <!-- PDFPage:440 -->separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to RCFC 58; and in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall similarly set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action. Requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of review. Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_52_1_target" name="Rule_52_1">1</a></sup> credibility of the witnesses. It will be sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are stated orally and recorded in open court following the close of the evidence or appear in an opinion or memorandum of decision filed by the court. Findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under RCFC 12 or 56 or any other motion except as provided in subdivision (c) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendment.</strong> On a party's motion filed no later than 10 days after entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings&mdash;or make additional findings&mdash;and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under RCFC 59. The sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings may be later questioned whether or not in this court the party raising the question objected to the findings, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Judgment on Partial Findings.</strong> If during a trial a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue, or the court may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. Such a judgment shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The principal change in RCFC 52 relates to the enlargement of subdivision (c) to include, among issues subject to judgment on partial findings, the adjudication of issues critical to the legal sufficiency of a &ldquo;defense.&rdquo; The amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of law may be entered against both plaintiffs and defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.</p>
