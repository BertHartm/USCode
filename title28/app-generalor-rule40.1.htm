<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> To promote docket efficiency, to conform to the requirements of any case management plan, or for the efficient administration of justice, a case may be transferred by order of the assigned judge to another judge upon the agreement of both judges.

<p class="note-body">RCFC 40.1 has no FRCP counterpart. The substance of the rule formerly appeared in these rules as part of paragraph (1) of RCFC 77(f). The renumbering of RCFC 77(f) reflects its more logical placement in the structure of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new language introduced by the rule&mdash;subdivision (b)&mdash;represents a codification of internal procedures.</p>
