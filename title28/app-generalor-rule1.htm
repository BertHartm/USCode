<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Scope. (1)</strong> These rules govern all proceedings in actions filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims on or after October 1, 1982, and all further proceedings in actions then pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application in a particular action pending on October 1, 1982, would not be feasible or would work an injustice. In such event the court by order shall adapt the prior procedures of the United States Court of Claims as required. These rules shall be cited as RCFC.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> These rules shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> In all cases not provided for by rule, a judge may regulate the applicable practice in any manner not inconsistent with these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</strong> The Federal Rules applicable to civil actions tried by the court sitting without a jury and in effect on December 1, 1991, have been incorporated in these rules to the extent that they appropriately can be applied to proceedings in this court.</p>
