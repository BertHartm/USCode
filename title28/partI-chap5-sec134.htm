<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;1 and section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, &sect;34, 31 Stat. 84; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;1, 36 Stat. 1087; Jan. 7, 1913; ch. 6, 37 Stat. 648; July 30, 1914, ch. 216, 38 Stat. 580; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, &sect;41, 39 Stat. 965; Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, &sect;1, 41 Stat. 1412; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, &sect;1, 42 Stat. 837; Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, &sect;2, 52 Stat. 118).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates the last paragraph of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with portions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the number of judges in the various districts are incorporated in section 133 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of section 863, see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception in subsection (b) &ldquo;except in the District of Columbia&rdquo; conforms with the recent decision in <em>U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher</em>, 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See reviser's note under section 44 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The clause in said last paragraph of section 1 of title 28 providing that any district judge, who violates the residence requirement, shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, was omitted. This penalty provision was attached to the residence requirement at the time of compilation of the Revised Statutes of 1878, although it is apparent that Congress only intended that the penalty should be invoked upon the unauthorized practice of law. See <em>U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher</em>, supra, in which an outline of the history of said section 1 of title 28 is given.</p>
