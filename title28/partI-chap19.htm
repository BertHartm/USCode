<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;334 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;227, 36 Stat. 1154; Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 285, &sect;1, 36 Stat. 1419; July 1, 1922, ch. 267, &sect;3, 42 Stat. 816; June 12, 1926, ch. 568, 44 Stat. 736; Jan. 29, 1929, ch. 113, 45 Stat. 1143; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, &sect;1, 45 Stat. 1475; July 3, 1930, ch. 863, &sect;1, 46 Stat. 1016; Feb. 23, 1931, ch. 276, &sect;30, 46 Stat. 1214; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; June 30, 1932, ch. 314, &sect;501, 47 Stat. 415; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, &sect;512, 48 Stat. 758; Ex. Ord. No. 6166, &sect;&sect;12, 14, June 10, 1933; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; May 27, 1936, ch. 463, &sect;1, 49 Stat. 1380; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, &sect;5, 49 Stat. 1549; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921).</p>
<p class="note-body">Requirements for printing, binding, and issuing Supreme Court decisions &ldquo;within eight months after said decisions have been rendered by the Supreme Court&rdquo; and provision for distribution &ldquo;within said period&rdquo; were omitted. The phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable after rendition&rdquo; was made the time for publishing such decisions as more flexible and practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;the United States Court for China&rdquo; were omitted inasmuch as that court is no longer functioning. The Secretary of State by an arrangement with China has relinquished the extraterritorial jurisdiction previously exercised by the United States in China. The 1944 Legislative and Judiciary Appropriation Act approved June 28, 1943, made no appropriation for the United States Court for China. Appropriations for other courts were made in title II of chapter 173 (57 Stat. 241). The last appropriation for the United States Court for China was in the act of July 2, 1942 (ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 502).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;to the Secretary of War for the use of the proper courts and officers of the Philippine Islands, seven copies&rdquo; were omitted in view of the independence of the Philippines, effective July 4, 1946.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;justice or judge of the United States&rdquo; obviated repetition of names of courts. (See definitive section 451 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Last sentence, fourth paragraph, of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that books should remain the property of the United States and should be preserved and turned over to successors in office, was omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A reference to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by &ldquo;each United States attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision authorizing distribution of volumes under this section to each place where a court of appeals is held was added for purposes of uniformity. See similar provision in section 413 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in lieu of the Attorney General insofar as distribution of volumes to the judiciary is concerned. This change is consistent with the duties of the former under section 601 et seq. of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to the custody, use and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The limitation of 10 copies to the library of the Supreme Court and 6 copies to the marshal of the Supreme Court for use of the justices, was omitted and the provision for distribution in such number &ldquo;specified by the Chief Justice of the United States&rdquo; was substituted therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Acts July 1, 1922, ch. 267, &sect;5, 42 Stat. 818; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, &sect;3, 44 Stat. 678 which is omitted, but not repealed, as unnecessary in this revision.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of this section substitutes, in section 411(a) of title 28, U.S.C., &ldquo;Secretary of the Army&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department of the Army&rdquo; for &ldquo;Secretary of War&rdquo; and &ldquo;War Department,&rdquo; in view of such redesignation by act of July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, title II, &sect;205(a), 61 Stat. 501). It substitutes, in section 411(a), &ldquo;Commissioner of Customs; Commandant of the Coast Guard&rdquo; for &ldquo;Chief of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation,&rdquo; in view of the abolishment of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, and the transfer of its functions to, and the division thereof between, the Commissioner of Customs and the Commandant of the Coast Guard, by 1946 Reorganization Plan No. 3, &sect;&sect;101&ndash;104, effective July 16, 1946 (11 F.R. 7875, 60 Stat. 1097).</p>
<p class="note-body">It substitutes, in such section 411(a), &ldquo;Director of the Bureau of Land Management&rdquo; for &ldquo;Commissioner of the General Land Office,&rdquo; in view of section 403 of such plan which abolished the General Land Office and created the Bureau of Land Management, headed by a Director. It inserts as new, in such section 411(a), references to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, and Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, in view of the creation of the National Military Establishment, headed by the Secretary of Defense, and the establishment of the Department of the Air Force in 1947.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of this section redesignates, in section 411(b) of title 28, U.S.C., the Secretary of War as &ldquo;Secretary of the Army,&rdquo; for the reasons stated above, and corrects a typographical error in the word &ldquo;court-martial&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to expenditures for &ldquo;lawbooks&rdquo; for the Tax Court of the United States, with sections 337 and 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to purchase and distribution of reporter and digest volumes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 604 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., limiting the price to be paid for volumes of the Federal Reporter and other similar reports were omitted after consultation with the Administrative Office of United States Courts as more properly covered by current appropriation acts. Similar provisions relating to the Federal Digest and the United States Code Annotated were omitted as covered in current appropriation acts.

<p class="note-body">Provisions of said section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that books are to remain United States property, so marked, and transmitted to successors in office of persons receiving them, were omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">The revised section is extended to include the Customs Court as well as the Court of Claims and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that &ldquo;statutes&rdquo; shall be delivered to successors of United States attorneys and clerks and provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that all lawbooks for judges and others shall be marked as property of the United States and shall be transmitted to their successors, with section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to transmittal of &ldquo;Government publications.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;All Government publications and lawbooks&rdquo; and &ldquo;furnished under this chapter&rdquo; were used to cover &ldquo;all statutes&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Federal Reporter and continuations thereto.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;justices and judges of the United States&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;United States judges&rdquo; in conformity with uniform use of the phrase to describe all members of the Federal judiciary. Similar provisions in sections 334 and 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were therefore omitted as covered by this revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 413 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;permanent or bound&rdquo; were inserted in the last sentence of the revised section to obviate the wasteful practice under existing law of marking temporary pamphlets.</p>
