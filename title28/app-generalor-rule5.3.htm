<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5.3. Form, Size, and Duplication of all Papers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> All papers filed with the clerk shall conform with these rules as to methods of duplication, form, size, and number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Duplication.</strong> All requirements of duplication may be satisfied by the use of any photocopy method capable of producing a clear, black image on white paper, provided that in each instance the duplication shall conform to the requirements of subdivision (c) as to paper, size, form, and pagination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Form and Size.</strong> All papers pursuant to the provisions of this rule shall be duplicated on pages not exceeding 81/2 by 11 inches, with type matter on all papers other than exhibits to be of letter quality. Type size for both text and footnotes shall not be smaller than 12 point and margins shall not be less than 1 on all sides. Papers duplicated shall be double spaced, except that quoted and indented material and footnotes may be single spaced, and, if covering both sides of the sheet, shall be duplicated on paper of sufficient quality that the duplication process does not bleed through the sheet. Except for submissions of fewer than 50 pages, which may be stapled in the upper left-hand margin, all submissions must be bound or attached along the entire left margin in book form and shall have legible margins when bound or attached. Such pages need not be justified on the right margin. All pages, including appendices, shall be numbered. Page numbers shall be in large, distinct type and shall appear in the center of the bottom margin of the page.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Number of Copies.</strong> Plaintiff shall file an original and 7 copies of the complaint, the original of which shall be accompanied by the completed cover sheet as shown in the Appendix of Forms (Form 2) utilizing the Cover Sheet Information. Except as provided in RCFC 58.1, the parties shall file an original and 2 copies of each other paper required by these rules to be filed with the clerk. In congressional reference cases, an original and 4 copies of each such paper shall be filed. All copies shall be identical, or otherwise conformed, to the original.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Date.</strong> Each paper shall bear the date it is signed on the signature page.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Telephone and Facsimile Numbers.</strong> The telephone and facsimile numbers (including area <!-- PDFPage:411 -->code) of the attorney of record must appear beneath the signature line of every pleading or other paper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Name of Judge.</strong> In pleadings and papers other than the complaint, the name of the judge assigned to the case shall be included under the docket number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Bid Protest Cases.</strong> In all pleadings and papers, the words &ldquo;Bid Protest&rdquo; shall be included in the caption under the name of the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">New RCFC 5.3 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 82 and 83. The consolidation and renumbering of RCFC 82 and 83 were intended to reflect their more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the renumbering, the text of former RCFC 82 has been modified in several respects: First, subdivision (a) has been modified by deleting the last sentence of that subdivision which read, &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall refuse to file any paper which is not in substantial conformity with this rule or not in clear type.&rdquo; The deletion corresponds to the change made in RCFC 5(e) directing that &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form.&rdquo; However, as noted in the Advisory Committee Note to FRCP 5(e), the &ldquo;clerk may of course advise a party or counsel that a particular instrument is not in proper form, and may be directed to so inform the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, subdivision (c) has been modified to eliminate certain redundancies, to fix the type size, and to clarify binding and pagination requirements. Appendices will now be subject to pagination. The binding requirement changes were intended to discourage rubber bands, paper clips, and other non-secure binding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, former subdivision (e), now subdivision (f), has been amended to include a requirement listing a facsimile number for the attorney of record.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, subdivision (d) was added to this rule to incorporate the &ldquo;number of copies&rdquo; requirement that formerly appeared as RCFC 83, as well as the requirement formerly found in RCFC 3(c) regarding the number of copies to be filed when filing a complaint.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, subdivision (g) was also added. The text of this subdivision formerly appeared as part of RCFC 10(a).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (h) has been added to the text of RCFC 5.3 to facilitate case management and administrative record-keeping requirements.</p>
