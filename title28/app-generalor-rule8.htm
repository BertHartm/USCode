<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Claims for Relief.</strong> A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Defenses; Form of Denials.</strong> A party shall state in short and plain terms the party's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If a party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the party shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, the pleader shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, the pleader may make denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs or may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the pleader expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all its averments, including averments of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, the pleader may do so by general denial subject to the obligations set forth in RCFC 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Affirmative Defenses.</strong> In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estop<!-- PDFPage:413 -->pel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Failure to Deny.</strong> Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Pleading to Be Concise and Direct; Consistency.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or equitable grounds. All statements shall be made subject to the obligations set forth in RCFC 11.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Construction of Pleadings.</strong> All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes have been made in subdivisions (b) and (c) to conform to FRCP 8. In addition, subdivision (c) was amended to require the pleading, as an affirmative defense, of assumption of risk and contributory negligence. Although these defenses are typically associated with tort claims (i.e., with claims outside this court's jurisdiction), there can be circumstances in which reliance on these defenses would be appropriate, for example, in congressional reference cases, in some aspects of contract litigation, and with respect to counterclaims asserted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2508.</p>
