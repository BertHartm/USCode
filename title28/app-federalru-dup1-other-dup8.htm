<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Remedies Under State Law&mdash;In General.</cap-smallcap> At the commencement of and throughout an action, every remedy is available that, under the law of the state where the court is located, provides for seizing a person or property to secure satisfaction of the potential judgment. But a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Specific Kinds of Remedies.</cap-smallcap> The remedies available under this rule include the following&mdash;however designated and regardless of whether state procedure requires an independent action:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&bull; arrest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&bull; attachment;</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule adopts the existing Federal law, except that it specifies the applicable State law to be that of the time when the remedy is sought. Under U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;726 (Attachments as provided by State laws) the plaintiff was entitled to remedies by attachment or other process which were on June 1, 1872, provided by the applicable State law, and the district courts might, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such State laws as might be in force. This statute is superseded as are district court rules which are rendered unnecessary by the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Lis pendens</em>. No rule concerning <em>lis pendens</em> is stated, for this would appear to be a matter of substantive law affecting State laws of property. It has been held that in the absence of a State statute expressly providing for the recordation of notice of the pendency of Federal actions, the commencement of a Federal action is notice to all persons affected. <em>King v. Davis</em>, 137 Fed. 198 (W.D.Va., 1903). It has been held, however, that when a State statute does so provide expressly, its provisions are binding. <em>United States v. Calcasieu Timber Co</em>., 236 Fed. 196 (C.C.A.5th, 1916).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 64 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 64 stated that the Civil Rules govern an action in which any remedy available under Rule 64(a) is used. The Rules were said to govern from the time the action is commenced if filed in federal court, and from the time of removal if removed from state court. These provisions are deleted as redundant. Rule 1 establishes that the Civil Rules apply to all actions in a district court, and Rule 81(c)(1) adds reassurance that the Civil Rules apply to a removed action &ldquo;after it is removed.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 65. Injunctions and Restraining Orders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Preliminary Injunction.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Notice.</em> The court may issue a preliminary injunction only on notice to the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Consolidating the Hearing with the Trial on the Merits.</em> Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing. Even when consolidation is not ordered, evidence that is received on the motion and that would be admissible at trial becomes part of the trial record and need not be repeated at trial. But <!-- PDFPage:280 -->the court must preserve any party's right to a jury trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Temporary Restraining Order.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Issuing Without Notice.</em> The court may issue a temporary restraining order without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney only if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Contents; Expiration.</em> Every temporary restraining order issued without notice must state the date and hour it was issued; describe the injury and state why it is irreparable; state why the order was issued without notice; and be promptly filed in the clerk's office and entered in the record. The order expires at the time after entry&mdash;not to exceed 14 days&mdash;that the court sets, unless before that time the court, for good cause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension. The reasons for an extension must be entered in the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Expediting the Preliminary-Injunction Hearing.</em> If the order is issued without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction must be set for hearing at the earliest possible time, taking precedence over all other matters except hearings on older matters of the same character. At the hearing, the party who obtained the order must proceed with the motion; if the party does not, the court must dissolve the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Motion to Dissolve.</em> On 2 days&rsquo; notice to the party who obtained the order without notice&mdash;or on shorter notice set by the court&mdash;the adverse party may appear and move to dissolve or modify the order. The court must then hear and decide the motion as promptly as justice requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Security.</cap-smallcap> The court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. The United States, its officers, and its agencies are not required to give security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Contents and Scope of Every Injunction and Restraining Order.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Contents.</em> Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) state the reasons why it issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) state its terms specifically; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) describe in reasonable detail&mdash;and not by referring to the complaint or other document&mdash;the act or acts restrained or required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Persons Bound.</em> The order binds only the following who receive actual notice of it by personal service or otherwise:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the parties&rsquo; officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) other persons who are in active concert or participation with anyone described in Rule 65(d)(2)(A) or (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Other Laws Not Modified.</cap-smallcap> These rules do not modify the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any federal statute relating to temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions in actions affecting employer and employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 28 U.S.C. &sect;2361, which relates to preliminary injunctions in actions of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) 28 U.S.C. &sect;2284, which relates to actions that must be heard and decided by a three-judge district court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Copyright Impoundment.</cap-smallcap> This rule applies to copyright-impoundment proceedings.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">It has been held that in actions on preliminary injunction bonds the district court has discretion to grant relief in the same proceeding or to require the institution of a new action on the bond. <em>Russell v. Farley</em> (1881) 105 U.S. 433, 466. It is believed, however, that in all cases the litigant should have a right to proceed on the bond in the same proceeding, in the manner provided in Rule 73(f) for a similar situation. The paragraph added to Rule 65(c) insures this result and is in the interest of efficiency. There is no reason why Rules 65(c) and 73(f) should operate differently. Compare &sect;50(n) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. &sect;78(n), under which actions on all bonds furnished pursuant to the Act may be proceeded upon summarily in the bankruptcy court. See 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy</em> (14th ed. by Moore and Oglebay) 1853&ndash;1854.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Specific enumeration of statutes dealing with labor injunctions is undesirable due to the enactment of amendatory or new legislation from time to time. The more general and inclusive reference, &ldquo;any statute of the United States&rdquo;, does not change the intent of subdivision (e) of Rule 65, and the subdivision will have continuing applicability without the need of subsequent readjustment to labor legislation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment relative to actions of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader substitutes the present statutory reference and will embrace any future amendment to statutory interpleader provided for in Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;2361.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act of August 24, 1937, provided for a district court of three judges to hear and determine an action to enjoin the enforcement of any Act of Congress for repugnance to the Constitution of the United States. The provisions of that Act dealing with the procedure for the issuance of temporary restraining orders and interlocutory and final injunctions have been included in revised Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;2284, which, however, has been broadened to apply to all actions required to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges. The amendatory saving clause of subdivision (e) of Rule 65 has been broadened accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2)</em>. This new subdivision provides express authority for consolidating the hearing of an application for a preliminary injunction with the trial on the merits. The authority can be exercised with particular profit when it appears that a substantial part of evidence offered on the application will be relevant to the merits and will be presented in such form as to qualify for admission on the trial proper. Repetition of evidence is thereby avoided. The fact that the proceedings have been consolidated should cause no delay in the disposition of the application for the preliminary injunction, for the evidence will be directed in the first instance to that relief, and the preliminary injunction, if justified by the proof, may be issued in the course of the consolidated proceedings. Furthermore, to consolidate the proceedings will tend to expedite the final disposition of the action. It is believed that consolidation can be usefully availed of in many cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision further provides that even when consolidation is not ordered, evidence received in connection with an application for a preliminary injunction for a preliminary injunction which would be admissible on the trial on the merits forms part of the trial record. This evidence need not be repeated on the trial. On the the other hand, repetition is not altogether prohibited. That would be impractical and unwise. For example, a witness testifying comprehensively on the trial who has previously testified upon the application for a preliminary injunction might sometimes be hamstrung in telling his story if he could not go over some part of his prior testimony to connect it with his present testimony. So also, some repetition of testimony may be called for where the trial is conducted by a judge who did not hear the application for the preliminary injunction. In general, however, repetition can be avoided with an increase of efficiency in the conduct of the case and without any distortion of the presentation of evidence by the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since an application for a preliminary injunction may be made in an action in which, with respect to all or part of the merits, there is a right to trial by jury, it is appropriate to add the caution appearing in the last sentence of the subdivision. In such a case the jury will have to hear all the evidence bearing on its verdict, even if some part of the evidence has already been heard by the judge alone on the application for the preliminary injunction.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision is believed to reflect the substance of the best current practice and introduces no novel conception.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. In view of the possibly drastic consequence of a temporary restraining order, the opposition should be heard, if feasible, before the order is granted. Many judges have properly insisted that, when time does not permit of formal notice of the application to the adverse party, some expedient, such as telephonic notice to the attorney for the adverse party, be resorted to if this can reasonably be done. On occasion, however, temporary restraining orders have been issued without any notice when it was feasible for some fair, although informal, notice to be given. See the emphatic criticisms in <em>Pennsylvania Rd. Co. v. Transport Workers Union</em>, 278 F.2d 693, 694 (3d Cir. 1960); <em>Arvida Corp. v. Sugarman</em>, 259 F.2d 428, 429 (2d Cir. 1958); <em>Lummus Co. v. Commonwealth Oil Ref. Co., Inc</em>., 297 F.2d 80, 83 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 986 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">Heretofore the first sentence of subdivision (b), in referring to a notice &ldquo;served&rdquo; on the &ldquo;adverse party&rdquo; on which a &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; could be held, perhaps invited the interpretation that the order might be granted without notice if the circumstances did not permit of a formal hearing on the basis of a formal notice. The subdivision is amended to make it plain that informal notice, which may be communicated to the attorney rather than the adverse party, is to be preferred to no notice at all.</p>
<p class="note-body">Before notice can be dispensed with, the applicant's counsel must give his certificate as to any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why notice should not be required. This certificate is in addition to the requirement of an affidavit or verified complaint setting forth the facts as to the irreparable injury which would result before the opposition could be heard.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended subdivision continues to recognize that a temporary restraining order may be issued without any notice when the circumstances warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Original Rules 65 and 73 contained substantially identical provisions for summary proceedings against sureties on bonds required or permitted by the rules. There was fragmentary coverage of the same subject in the Admiralty Rules. Clearly, a single comprehensive rule is required, and is incorporated as Rule 65.1.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2001 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (f) is added in conjunction with abrogation of the antiquated Copyright Rules of Practice adopted for proceedings under the 1909 Copyright Act. Courts have naturally turned to Rule 65 in response to the apparent inconsistency of the former Copyright Rules with the discretionary impoundment procedure <!-- PDFPage:282 -->adopted in 1976, 17 U.S.C. &sect;503(a). Rule 65 procedures also have assuaged well-founded doubts whether the Copyright Rules satisfy more contemporary requirements of due process. See, e.g., <em>Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communications Servs., Inc</em>., 923 F.Supp. 1231, 1260&ndash;1265 (N.D.Cal.1995); <em>Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Doe</em>, 821 F.Supp. 82 (E.D.N.Y.1993); <em>WPOW, Inc. v. MRLJ Enterprises</em>, 584 F.Supp. 132 (D.D.C.1984).</p>
<p class="note-body">A common question has arisen from the experience that notice of a proposed impoundment may enable an infringer to defeat the court's capacity to grant effective relief. Impoundment may be ordered on an ex parte basis under subdivision (b) if the applicant makes a strong showing of the reasons why notice is likely to defeat effective relief. Such no-notice procedures are authorized in trademark infringement proceedings, see 15 U.S.C. &sect;1116(d), and courts have provided clear illustrations of the kinds of showings that support ex parte relief. See <em>Matter of Vuitton et Fils S.A</em>., 606 F.2d 1 (2d Cir.1979); <em>Vuitton v. White</em>, 945 F.2d 569 (3d Cir.1991). In applying the tests for no-notice relief, the court should ask whether impoundment is necessary, or whether adequate protection can be had by a less intrusive form of no-notice relief shaped as a temporary restraining order.</p>
<p class="note-body">This new subdivision (f) does not limit use of trademark procedures in cases that combine trademark and copyright claims. Some observers believe that trademark procedures should be adopted for all copyright cases, a proposal better considered by Congressional processes than by rulemaking processes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">These rules govern an action in which the appointment of a receiver is sought or a receiver sues or is sued. But the practice in administering an estate by a receiver or a similar court-appointed officer must accord with the historical practice in federal courts or with a local rule. An action in which a receiver has been appointed may be dismissed only by court order.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The title of Rule 66 has been expanded to make clear the subject of the rule, <em>i.e</em>., federal equity receivers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence added to Rule 66 prevents a dismissal by any party, after a federal equity receiver has been appointed, except upon leave of court. A party should not be permitted to oust the court and its officer without the consent of that court. See Civil Rule 31(e), Eastern District of Washington.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence added at the beginning of the rule deals with suits by or against a federal equity receiver. The first clause thereof eliminates the formal ceremony of an ancillary appointment before suit can be brought by a receiver, and is in accord with the more modern state practice, and with more expeditious and less expensive judicial administration. 2 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 2088&ndash;2091. For the rule necessitating ancillary appointment, see <em>Sterrett v. Second Nat. Bank</em> (1918) 248 U.S. 73; <em>Kelley v. Queeney</em> (W.D.N.Y. 1941) 41 F.Supp. 1015; see also <em>McCandless v. Furlaud</em> (1934) 293 U.S. 67. This rule has been extensively criticized. First, <em>Extraterritorial Powers of Receivers</em> (1932) 27 Ill.L.Rev. 271; Rose, <em>Extraterritorial Actions by Receivers</em> (1933) 17 Minn.L.Rev. 704; Laughlin, <em>The Extraterritorial Powers of Receivers</em> (1932) 45 Harv.L.Rev. 429; Clark and Moore, <em>A New Federal Civil Procedure&mdash;II, Pleadings and Parties</em> (1935) 44 Yale L.J. 1291, 1312&ndash;1315; Note (1932) 30 Mich.L.Rev. 1322. See also comment in <em>Bicknell v. Lloyd-Smith</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 109 F.(2d) 527, cert. den. (1940) 311 U.S. 650. The second clause of the sentence merely incorporates the well-known and general rule that, absent statutory authorization, a federal receiver cannot be sued without leave of the court which appointed him, applied in the federal courts since <em>Barton v. Barbour</em> (1881) 104 U.S. 126. See also 1 <em>Clark on Receivers</em> (2d ed.) &sect;549. Under 28 U.S.C. &sect;125, leave of court is unnecessary when a receiver is sued &ldquo;in respect of any act or transaction of his in carrying on the business&rdquo; connected with the receivership property, but such suit is <!-- PDFPage:283 -->subject to the general equity jurisdiction of the court in which the receiver was appointed, so far as justice necessitates.</p>
<p class="note-body">Capacity of a state court receiver to sue or be sued in federal court is governed by Rule 17(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence added to Rule 66 assures the application of the rules in all matters except actual administration of the receivership estate itself. Since this implicitly carries with it the applicability of those rules relating to appellate procedure, the express reference thereto contained in Rule 66 has been stricken as superfluous. Under Rule 81(a)(1) the rules do not apply to bankruptcy proceedings except as they may be made applicable by order of the Supreme Court. Rule 66 is applicable to what is commonly known as a federal &ldquo;chancery&rdquo; or &ldquo;equity&rdquo; receiver, or similar type of court officer. It is not designed to regulate or affect receivers in bankruptcy, which are governed by the Bankruptcy Act and the General Orders. Since the Federal Rules are applicable in bankruptcy by virtue of General Orders in Bankruptcy 36 and 37 [following section 53 of Title 11, U.S.C.] only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Act or the General Orders, Rule 66 is not applicable to bankruptcy receivers. See <em>1 Collier on Bankruptcy</em> (14th ed. by Moore and Oglebay) &nbsp;2.23&ndash;2.36.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;&sect;754 and 959(a), state the capacity of a federal receiver to sue or be sued in a federal court, and a repetitive statement of the statute in Rule 66 is confusing and undesirable. See also Note to Rule 17(b), <em>supra.</em></p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule provides for deposit in court generally, continuing similar special provisions contained in such statutes as U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;41(26) [now 1335, 1397, 2361] (Original jurisdiction of bills of interpleader, and of bills in the nature of interpleader). See generally <em>Howard v. United States</em>, 184 U.S. 676 (1902); United States Supreme Court Admiralty Rules (1920), Rules 37 (Bringing Funds into Court), 41 (Funds in Court Registry), and 42 (Claims Against Proceeds in Registry).

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the Act of June 26, 1934, was amended by Act of December 21, 1944, 58 Stat. 845, correcting references are made.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 67 has been amended in three ways. The first change is the addition of the clause in the first sentence. Some courts have construed the present rule to permit deposit only when the party making it claims no interest in the fund or thing deposited. <em>E.g., Blasin-Stern v. Beech-Nut Life Savers Corp</em>., 429 F.Supp. 533 (D. Puerto Rico 1975); <em>Dinkins v. General Aniline & Film Corp</em>., 214 F.Supp. 281 (S.D.N.Y. 1963). However, there are situations in which a litigant may wish to be relieved of responsibility for a sum or thing, but continue to claim an interest in all or part of it. In these cases the deposit-in-court procedure should be available; in addition to the advantages to the party making the deposit, the procedure gives other litigants assurance that any judgment will be collectable. The amendment is intended to accomplish that.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second change is the addition of a requirement that the order of deposit be served on the clerk of the court in which the sum or thing is to be deposited. This is simply to assure that the clerk knows what is being deposited and what his responsibilities are with respect to the deposit. The latter point is particularly important since the rule as amended contemplates that deposits will be placed in interest-bearing accounts; the clerk must know what treatment has been ordered for the particular deposit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third change is to require that any money be deposited in an interest-bearing account or instrument approved by the court.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Making an Offer; Judgment on an Accepted Offer.</cap-smallcap> At least 14 days before the date set for trial, a party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms, with the costs then accrued. If, within 14 days after being served, the opposing party serves written notice accepting the offer, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance, plus proof of service. The clerk must then enter judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Unaccepted Offer.</cap-smallcap> An unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn, but it does not preclude a later offer. Evidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Offer After Liability is Determined.</cap-smallcap> When one party's liability to another has been determined but the extent of liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party held liable may make an offer of judgment.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Paying Costs After an Unaccepted Offer.</cap-smallcap> If the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the <!-- PDFPage:284 -->unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.</p>

<p class="note-body">The third sentence of Rule 68 has been altered to make clear that evidence of an unaccepted offer is admissible in a proceeding to determine the costs of the action but is not otherwise admissible.</p>
<p class="note-body">The two sentences substituted for the deleted last sentence of the rule assure a party the right to make a second offer where the situation permits&mdash;as, for example, where a prior offer was not accepted but the plaintiff's judgment is nullified and a new trial ordered, whereupon the defendant desires to make a second offer. It is implicit, however, that as long as the case continues&mdash;whether there be a first, second or third trial&mdash;and the defendant makes no further offer, his first and only offer will operate to save him the costs from the time of that offer if the plaintiff ultimately obtains a judgment less than the sum offered. In the case of successive offers not accepted, the offeror is saved the costs incurred after the making of the offer which was equal to or greater than the judgment ultimately obtained. These provisions should serve to encourage settlements and avoid protracted litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;before the trial begins&rdquo;, in the first sentence of the rule, has been construed in <em>Cover v. Chicago Eye Shield Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 374, cert. den. (1943) 320 U.S. 749.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>

<p class="note-body">Former Rule 68 allowed service of an offer of judgment more than 10 days before the trial begins, or&mdash;if liability has been determined&mdash;at least 10 days before a hearing to determine the extent of liability. It may be difficult to know in advance when trial will begin or when a hearing will be held. The time is now measured from the date set for trial or hearing; resetting the date establishes a new time for serving the offer.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former 10-day periods are extended to 14 days to reflect the change in the Rule 6(a) method for computing periods less than 11 days.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment assures that, in aid of execution on a judgment, all discovery procedures provided in the rules are available and not just discovery via the taking of a deposition. Under the present language, one court has held that Rule 34 discovery is unavailable to the judgment creditor. <em>M. Lowenstein & Sons, Inc. v. American Underwear Mfg. Co</em>., 11 F.R.D. 172 (E.D.Pa. 1951). Notwithstanding the language, and relying heavily on legislative history referring to Rule 33, the Fifth Circuit has held that a judgment creditor may invoke Rule 33 interrogatories. <em>United States v. McWhirter</em>, 376 F.2d 102 (5th Cir. 1967). But the court's reasoning does not extend to discovery except as provided in Rules 26&ndash;33. One commentator suggests that the existing language might properly be stretched to all discovery, 7 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;69.05[1] (2d ed. 1966), but another believes that a rules amendment is needed. 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 1484 (Wright ed. 1958). Both commentators and the court in <em>McWhirter</em> are clear that, as a matter of policy, Rule 69 should authorize the use of all discovery devices provided in the rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 69 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended Rule 69(b) incorporates directly the provisions of 2 U.S.C. &sect;118 and 28 U.S.C. &sect;2006, deleting the incomplete statement in former Rule 69(b) of the circumstances in which execution does not issue against an officer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Party's Failure to Act; Ordering Another to Act.</cap-smallcap> If a judgment requires a party to convey land, to deliver a deed or other document, or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may order the act to be done&mdash;at the disobedient party's expense&mdash;by another person appointed by the court. When done, the act has the same effect as if done by the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Vesting Title.</cap-smallcap> If the real or personal property is within the district, the court&mdash;instead of ordering a conveyance&mdash;may enter a judgment divesting any party's title and vesting it in others. That judgment has the effect of a legally executed conveyance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Obtaining a Writ of Attachment or Sequestration.</cap-smallcap> On application by a party entitled to performance of an act, the clerk must issue a writ of attachment or sequestration against the disobedient party's property to compel obedience.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Obtaining a Writ of Execution or Assistance.</cap-smallcap> On application by a party who obtains a judgment or order for possession, the clerk must issue a writ of execution or assistance.</p>
