<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section follows the recommendation of the Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1937) which included the following rule:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Rule 77. <cap-smallcap>Registration of judgments in other district courts</cap-smallcap>. A judgment entered in any district court and which has become final through expiration of the time for appeal or by mandate on appeal may be registered in any other district court by filing therein an authenticated copy of the judgment. When so registered the judgment shall have the same effect and like proceedings for its enforcement may be taken thereon in the court in which it is registered as if the judgment had been originally entered by that court. If in the court in which the judgment was originally entered, the judgment has been satisfied in whole or in part or if an order has been made modifying or vacating it or affecting or suspending its operation, the party procuring the registration shall and any other party may file authenticated copies of the satisfaction or order with the court in which the judgment is registered. This rule shall not be construed to limit the effect of the Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592, &sect;20 (33 Stat. 729), as amended, U.S.C., title 15, &sect;100; or the Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, &sect;&sect;36 and 37 (35 Stat. 1084), U.S.C., title 17, &sect;&sect;36 and 37; or &sect;56 of the Judicial Code, U.S.C., title 28, &sect;117; or to authorize the registration elsewhere of an order or a judgment rendered in a divorce action in the District of Columbia.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2508 of this title provides for the registration of judgments of the Court of Claims in favor of the United States in any district. See, also, section 2413 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;for the recovery of money or property&rdquo; was not in the committee's draft of Rule 77 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but was inserted in the revised section to exclude judgments in divorce actions, and any other actions, the registration of which would serve no useful purpose.</p>
