<p class="statutory-body">(a) The judges of each United States district court and the district courts of the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands shall appoint United States magistrate judges in such numbers and to serve at such locations within the judicial districts as the Judicial Conference may determine under this chapter. In the case of a magistrate judge appointed by the district court of the Virgin Islands, Guam, or the Northern Mariana Islands, this chapter shall apply as though the court appointing such a magistrate judge were a United States district court. Where there is more than one judge of a district court, the appointment, whether an original appointment or a reappointment, shall be by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, and when there is no such concurrence, then by the chief judge. Where the conference deems it desirable, a magistrate judge may be designated to serve in one or more districts adjoining the district for which he is appointed. Such a designation shall be made by the concurrence of a majority of the judges of each of the district courts involved and shall specify the duties to be performed by the magistrate judge in the adjoining district or districts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No individual may be appointed or reappointed to serve as a magistrate judge under this chapter unless:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The appointment of any individual as a full-time magistrate judge shall be for a term of eight years, and the appointment of any individuals as a part-time magistrate judge shall be for a term of four years, except that the term of a full-time or part-time magistrate judge appointed under subsection (k)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#631_1_target" name="631_1">1</a></sup> shall expire upon&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Each individual appointed as a magistrate judge under this section shall take the oath or affirmation prescribed by section 453 of this title before performing the duties of his office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Each appointment made by a judge or judges of a district court shall be entered of record in such court, and notice of such appointment shall be given at once by the clerk of that court to the Director.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Removal of a magistrate judge during the term for which he is appointed shall be only for incompetency, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or mental disability, but a magistrate judge's office shall be terminated if the conference determines that the services performed by his office are no longer needed. Removal shall be by the judges of the district court for the judicial district in which the magistrate judge serves; where there is more than one judge of a district court, removal shall not occur unless a majority of all the judges of such court concur in the order of removal; and when there is a tie vote of the judges of the district court on the question of the removal or retention in office of a magistrate judge, then removal shall be only by a concurrence of a majority of all the judges of the council.

<!-- PDFPage:274 --><p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 526 and a portion of 527, both of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with provisions of sections 27, 66, 80e, 100, 117e, 129, 172, 198e, 204e, 256d, 395e, 403c&ndash;5, 403h&ndash;5, 404c&ndash;5 and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to appointment of United States commissioners. For other provisions of said sections see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some of the provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions were retained in that title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of sections 395e, 403c&ndash;5, 404c&ndash;5, and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for appointment of the Park Commissioner in the Hawaii National Park, Shenandoah National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Mammoth Cave National Park and Isle Royale National Park upon &ldquo;the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior&rdquo; was omitted as inconsistent not only with other provisions of this title but with other statutes applicable to other national parks.</p>
<p class="note-body">All such park commissioners are United States commissioners and the revision of these sections makes possible uniformity and consistency in administrative matters concerning such commissioners. (See, also, sections 604 and 634 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., in view of the general supervision by the Director over clerks and commissioners under section 601 et seq. of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">See, also, section 751 of this title prohibiting clerks from receiving compensation in another capacity.</p>
<p class="note-body">First sentence of subsection (b) was substituted for the provision in section 527 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., prohibiting specified persons from acting as commissioners.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;at such places in the district as may be designated by the district court,&rdquo; in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that commissioners should have the same powers and duties as are conferred and imposed by law, was omitted as superfluous.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase in sections 526 and 527 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;except as provided in section 591&rdquo; and section 591, the effect of which was to except Alaska from this section, were omitted as unnecessary. This revised section by its terms limits the section and chapter 43 of this title to commissioners appointed by a &ldquo;district court,&rdquo; which includes the courts enumerated in chapter 5 of this title but not those of Alaska, Canal Zone, or Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections from title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., contained no tenure provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in phraseology were made.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Prior residence requirement for national park commissioners in section 635</em>.&mdash;Based on sections 1a and 403c&ndash;9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation (Aug. 19, 1937, ch. 703, &sect;8, 50 Stat. 702; June 28, 1938, ch. 778, &sect;1, 52 Stat. 1213).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 1a with part of section 403c&ndash;9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to residence of a national park commissioner.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of sections 1a and 403c&ndash;9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation by the Secretary of the Interior of some place of residence reasonably adjacent to the park was modified by making such designation subject to the approval of the appointing court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Senate Revision Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">By Senate amendment, &ldquo;Big Bend&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crater Lake&rdquo; were inserted in subsection (a) of this section, and section 158a of title 16, U.S.C., which was derived from act May 15, 1947, ch. 55, &sect;1, 61 Stat. 91, accordingly became an additional source of this section, such Act being included in the schedule of repeals. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.</p>
<p class="note-body">As finally enacted, act May 15, 1947, ch. 57, 61 Stat. 92, which amended section 403c&ndash;5 of title 16, U.S.C., became an additional source of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment.

<h4 class="note-head">1949 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment conforms the language of section 631(b) to the provisions of section 35 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by the act of June 28, 1946 (&sect;3, 60 Stat. 324), that full-time referees in bankruptcy may not be appointed United States Commissioners.</p>
<p class="note-body">This amendment also removes an ambiguity from section 631(b) by making it clear that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has power to establish maximum limits of compensation to be received for performing the combined offices of commissioner and clerk or deputy clerk. This was the intent of sections 631 and 751 of title 28. (See the fifteenth paragraph of the reviser's note to the latter section, H. Rept. No. 308, April 25, 1947, p. A90, to accompany H.R. 3214, 80th Cong.)</p>
