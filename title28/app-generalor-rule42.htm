<h3 class="section-head">Rule 42. Consolidation; Separate Trials</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Consolidation.</strong> When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials.</strong> The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Separate Determination of Liability.</strong> Upon stipulation of the parties, as approved by the court, or upon order of the court, a trial may be limited to the issues of law and fact relating to the right of a party to recover, reserving the determination of the amount of recovery, if any, for further proceedings. In any case, whether or not a stipulation or order has been made under subdivision (c) of this rule, the court, upon determining that a party is entitled to recover, may reserve determination of the amount of the recovery for further proceedings. Any motion for reconsideration shall be filed not later than 10 days after a separate determination of liability.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 42 remains unchanged. Thus, as before, the rule parallels in part FRCP 42 and, in addition, includes subdivision (c) (&ldquo;Separate Determination of Liability&rdquo;) permitting the liability phase of a lawsuit to be separated from, and decided independently of, the quantum phase.</p>
