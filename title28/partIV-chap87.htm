<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought only in (1) a judicial district where any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State, (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (3) a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced, if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.</p>

In a State which has more than one judicial district and in which a defendant that is a corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced, such corporation shall be deemed to reside in any district in that State within which its contacts would be sufficient to subject it to personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate State, and, if there is no such district, the corporation shall be deemed to reside in the district within which it has the most significant contacts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An alien may be sued in any district.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority, or an agency of the United States, or the United States, may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which (1) a defendant in the action resides, (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (3) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action. Additional persons may be joined as parties to any such action in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and with such other venue requirements as would be applicable if the United States or one of its officers, employees, or agencies were not a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The summons and complaint in such an action shall be served as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure except that the delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A civil action against a foreign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title may be brought&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;111, 112 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;50, 51, 36 Stat. 1101; Sept. 19, 1922, ch. 345, 42 Stat. 849; Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 526, &sect;1, 43 Stat. 1264; Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 230, 49 Stat. 1213).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 112 of such title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The portion of section 112 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue generally constitutes this section and the parts relating to arrest of the defendant, venue and process in stockholders&rsquo; actions constitute sections 1401, 1693, and 1695 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision in section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a district court may proceed as to parties before it although one or more defendants do not reside in the district, and that its judgment shall be without prejudice to such absent defendants, was omitted as covered by rule 19(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Word &ldquo;action&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;suit&rdquo; in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Word &ldquo;reside&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;whereof he is an inhabitant&rdquo; for clarity inasmuch as &ldquo;inhabitant&rdquo; and &ldquo;resident&rdquo; are synonymous. (See <em>Ex parte Shaw</em>, 1892, 12 S.Ct. 935, 145 U.S. 444, 36 L.Ed. 768; <em>Standard Stoker Co., Inc. v. Lower</em>, D.C., 1931, 46 F.2d 678; <em>Edgewater Realty Co. v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co</em>., D.C., 1943, 49 F.Supp. 807.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to &ldquo;all plaintiffs&rdquo; and &ldquo;all defendants&rdquo; were substituted for references to &ldquo;the plaintiff&rdquo; and &ldquo;the defendant,&rdquo; in view of many decisions holding that the singular terms were used in a collective sense. (See <em>Smith v. Lyon</em>, 1890, 10 S.Ct. 303, 133 U.S. 315, 33 L.Ed. 635; <em>Hooe v. Jamieson</em>, 1897, 17 S.Ct. 596, 166 U.S. 395, 41 L.Ed. 1049; and <em>Fetzer v. Livermore</em>, D.C., 1926, 15 F.2d 462.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), references to defendants &ldquo;found&rdquo; within a district or voluntarily appearing were omitted. The use of the word &ldquo;found&rdquo; made section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ambiguous. The argument that an action could be brought in the district where one defendant resided and a nonresident defendant was &ldquo;found,&rdquo; was rejected in <em>Camp v. Gress</em>, 1919, 39 S.Ct. 478, 250 U.S. 308, 63 L.Ed. 997. However, this ambiguity will be obviated in the future by the omission of such reference.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) of this section is added to give statutory recognition to the weight of authority concerning a rule of venue as to which there has been a sharp conflict of decisions. (See <em>Sandusky Foundry & Machine Co. v. DeLavand</em>, 1918, D.C.Ohio, 251 F. 631, 632, and cases cited. See also <em>Keating v. Pennsylvania Co</em>., 1917, D.C.Ohio, 245 F. 155 and cases cited.)</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact are pending in different districts, such actions may be transferred to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. Such transfers shall be made by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation authorized by this section upon its determination that transfers for such proceedings will be for the convenience of parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions. Each action so transferred shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the panel may separate any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim, or third-party claim and remand any of such claims before the remainder of the action is remanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings shall be conducted by a judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation. For this purpose, upon request of the panel, a circuit judge or a district judge may be designated and assigned temporarily for service in the transferee district by the Chief Justice of the United States or the chief judge of the circuit, as may be required, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 13 of this title. With the consent of the transferee district court, such actions may be assigned by the panel to a judge or judges of such district. The judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned, the members of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation, and other circuit and district judges designated when needed by the panel may exercise the powers of a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions in such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Proceedings for the transfer of an action under this section may be initiated by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation upon its own initiative, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) motion filed with the panel by a party in any action in which transfer for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings under this section may be appropriate. A copy of such motion shall be filed in the district court in which the moving party's action is pending.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The panel shall give notice to the parties in all actions in which transfers for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings are contemplated, and such notice shall specify the time and place of any hearing to determine whether such transfer shall be made. Orders of the panel to set a hearing and other orders of the panel issued prior to the order either directing or denying transfer shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court in which a transfer hearing is to be or has been held. The panel's order of transfer shall be based upon a record of such hearing at which material evidence may be offered by any party to an action pending in any district that would be affected by the proceedings under this section, and shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon such record. Orders of transfer and such other orders as the panel may make <!-- PDFPage:360 -->thereafter shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of the transferee district and shall be effective when thus filed. The clerk of the transferee district court shall forthwith transmit a certified copy of the panel's order to transfer to the clerk of the district court from which the action is being transferred. An order denying transfer shall be filed in each district wherein there is a case pending in which the motion for transfer has been made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The judicial panel on multidistrict litigation shall consist of seven circuit and district judges designated from time to time by the Chief Justice of the United States, no two of whom shall be from the same circuit. The concurrence of four members shall be necessary to any action by the panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No proceedings for review of any order of the panel may be permitted except by extraordinary writ pursuant to the provisions of title 28, section 1651, United States Code. Petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order of the panel to set a transfer hearing and other orders of the panel issued prior to the order either directing or denying transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the district in which a hearing is to be or has been held. Petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order to transfer or orders subsequent to transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the transferee district. There shall be no appeal or review of an order of the panel denying a motion to transfer for consolidated or coordinated proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The panel may prescribe rules for the conduct of its business not inconsistent with Acts of Congress and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Nothing in this section shall apply to any action in which the United States is a complainant arising under the antitrust laws. &ldquo;Antitrust laws&rdquo; as used herein include those acts referred to in the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended (38 Stat. 730; 15 U.S.C. 12), and also include the Act of June 19, 1936 (49 Stat. 1526; 15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, and 13b) and the Act of September 26, 1914, as added March 21, 1938 (52 Stat. 116, 117; 15 U.S.C. 56); but shall not include section 4A of the Act of October 15, 1914, as added July 7, 1955 (69 Stat. 282; 15 U.S.C. 15a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1404 or subsection (f) of this section, the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation may consolidate and transfer with or without the consent of the parties, for both pretrial purposes and for trial, any action brought under section 4C of the Clayton Act.</p>
