In a State which has more than one judicial district and in which a defendant that is a corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced, such corporation shall be deemed to reside in any district in that State within which its contacts would be sufficient to subject it to personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate State, and, if there is no such district, the corporation shall be deemed to reside in the district within which it has the most significant contacts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An alien may be sued in any district.</p>

Additional persons may be joined as parties to any such action in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and with such other venue requirements as would be applicable if the United States or one of its officers, employees, or agencies were not a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The summons and complaint in such an action shall be served as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure except that the delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A civil action against a foreign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title may be brought&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;111, 112 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;50, 51, 36 Stat. 1101; Sept. 19, 1922, ch. 345, 42 Stat. 849; Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 526, &sect;1, 43 Stat. 1264; Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 230, 49 Stat. 1213).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 112 of such title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The portion of section 112 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue generally constitutes this section and the parts relating to arrest of the defendant, venue and process in stockholders&rsquo; actions constitute sections 1401, 1693, and 1695 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision in section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a district court may proceed as to parties before it although one or more defendants do not reside in the district, and that its judgment shall be without prejudice to such absent defendants, was omitted as covered by rule 19(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Word &ldquo;action&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;suit&rdquo; in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Word &ldquo;reside&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;whereof he is an inhabitant&rdquo; for clarity inasmuch as &ldquo;inhabitant&rdquo; and &ldquo;resident&rdquo; are synonymous. (See <em>Ex parte Shaw</em>, 1892, 12 S.Ct. 935, 145 U.S. 444, 36 L.Ed. 768; <em>Standard Stoker Co., Inc. v. Lower</em>, D.C., 1931, 46 F.2d 678; <em>Edgewater Realty Co. v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co</em>., D.C., 1943, 49 F.Supp. 807.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to &ldquo;all plaintiffs&rdquo; and &ldquo;all defendants&rdquo; were substituted for references to &ldquo;the plaintiff&rdquo; and &ldquo;the defendant,&rdquo; in view of many decisions holding that the singular terms were used in a collective sense. (See <em>Smith v. Lyon</em>, 1890, 10 S.Ct. 303, 133 U.S. 315, 33 L.Ed. 635; <em>Hooe v. Jamieson</em>, 1897, 17 S.Ct. 596, 166 U.S. 395, 41 L.Ed. 1049; and <em>Fetzer v. Livermore</em>, D.C., 1926, 15 F.2d 462.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), references to defendants &ldquo;found&rdquo; within a district or voluntarily appearing were omitted. The use of the word &ldquo;found&rdquo; made section 111 of <!-- PDFPage:343 -->title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ambiguous. The argument that an action could be brought in the district where one defendant resided and a nonresident defendant was &ldquo;found,&rdquo; was rejected in <em>Camp v. Gress</em>, 1919, 39 S.Ct. 478, 250 U.S. 308, 63 L.Ed. 997. However, this ambiguity will be obviated in the future by the omission of such reference.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) of this section is added to give statutory recognition to the weight of authority concerning a rule of venue as to which there has been a sharp conflict of decisions. (See <em>Sandusky Foundry & Machine Co. v. DeLavand</em>, 1918, D.C.Ohio, 251 F. 631, 632, and cases cited. See also <em>Keating v. Pennsylvania Co</em>., 1917, D.C.Ohio, 245 F. 155 and cases cited.)</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact are pending in different districts, such actions may be transferred to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. Such transfers shall be made by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation authorized by this section upon its determination that transfers for such proceedings will be for the convenience of parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions. Each action so transferred shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the panel may separate any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim, or third-party claim and remand any of such claims before the remainder of the action is remanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings shall be conducted by a judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation. For this purpose, upon request of the panel, a circuit judge or a district judge may be designated and assigned temporarily for service in the transferee district by the Chief Justice of the United States or the chief judge of the circuit, as may be required, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 13 of this title. With the consent of the transferee district court, such actions may be assigned by the panel to a judge or judges of such district. The judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned, the members of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation, and other circuit and district judges designated when needed by the panel may exercise the powers of <!-- PDFPage:349 -->a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions in such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Proceedings for the transfer of an action under this section may be initiated by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation upon its own initiative, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) motion filed with the panel by a party in any action in which transfer for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings under this section may be appropriate. A copy of such motion shall be filed in the district court in which the moving party's action is pending.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The panel shall give notice to the parties in all actions in which transfers for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings are contemplated, and such notice shall specify the time and place of any hearing to determine whether such transfer shall be made. Orders of the panel to set a hearing and other orders of the panel issued prior to the order either directing or denying transfer shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court in which a transfer hearing is to be or has been held. The panel's order of transfer shall be based upon a record of such hearing at which material evidence may be offered by any party to an action pending in any district that would be affected by the proceedings under this section, and shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon such record. Orders of transfer and such other orders as the panel may make thereafter shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of the transferee district and shall be effective when thus filed. The clerk of the transferee district court shall forthwith transmit a certified copy of the panel's order to transfer to the clerk of the district court from which the action is being transferred. An order denying transfer shall be filed in each district wherein there is a case pending in which the motion for transfer has been made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The judicial panel on multidistrict litigation shall consist of seven circuit and district judges designated from time to time by the Chief Justice of the United States, no two of whom shall be from the same circuit. The concurrence of four members shall be necessary to any action by the panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No proceedings for review of any order of the panel may be permitted except by extraordinary writ pursuant to the provisions of title 28, section 1651, United States Code. Petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order of the panel to set a transfer hearing and other orders of the panel issued prior to the order either directing or denying transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the district in which a hearing is to be or has been held. Petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order to transfer or orders subsequent to transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the transferee district. There shall be no appeal or review of an order of the panel denying a motion to transfer for consolidated or coordinated proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The panel may prescribe rules for the conduct of its business not inconsistent with Acts of Congress and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Nothing in this section shall apply to any action in which the United States is a complainant arising under the antitrust laws. &ldquo;Antitrust laws&rdquo; as used herein include those acts referred to in the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended (38 Stat. 730; 15 U.S.C. 12), and also include the Act of June 19, 1936 (49 Stat. 1526; 15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, and 13b) and the Act of September 26, 1914, as added March 21, 1938 (52 Stat. 116, 117; 15 U.S.C. 56); but shall not include section 4A of the Act of October 15, 1914, as added July 7, 1955 (69 Stat. 282; 15 U.S.C. 15a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1404 or subsection (f) of this section, the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation may consolidate and transfer with or without the consent of the parties, for both pretrial purposes and for trial, any action brought under section 4C of the Clayton Act.</p>

The Clerk of the Panel shall serve this order on each party to the litigation but, in order to afford all parties the opportunity to oppose transfer, shall not send the order to the clerk of the transferee district court for fifteen days from the entry thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Parties to an action subject to a conditional transfer order shall notify the Clerk of the Panel within the fifteen-day period if that action is no longer pending in its transferor district court.</p>

The Clerk of the Panel shall notify the parties of the briefing schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Within fifteen days of the filing of its notice of opposition, the party opposing transfer shall file a motion to vacate the conditional transfer order and brief in support thereof.

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 7.5: Miscellaneous Provisions Concerning &ldquo;Tag-Along Actions&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Potential &ldquo;tag-along actions&rdquo; filed in the transferee district require no action on the part of the Panel and requests for assignment of such actions to the Section 1407 transferee judge should be made in accordance with local rules for the assignment of related actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Upon learning of the pendency of a potential &ldquo;tag-along action&rdquo; and having reasonable anticipation of opposition to transfer of that action, the Panel may direct the Clerk of the Panel to file a show cause order, in accordance with Rule 7.3 of these Rules, instead of a conditional transfer order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Failure to serve one or more of the defendants in a potential &ldquo;tag-along action&rdquo; with the complaint and summons as required by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not preclude transfer of such action under Section 1407. Such failure, however, may be submitted by such a defendant as a basis for opposing the proposed transfer if prejudice can be shown. The inability of the Clerk of the Panel to serve a conditional transfer order on all plaintiffs or defendants or their counsel shall not render the transfer of the action void but can be submitted by such a party as a basis for moving to remand as to such party if prejudice can be shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A civil action apparently involving common questions of fact with actions under consideration by the Panel for transfer under Section 1407, which was either not included in a motion under Rule 7.2 of these Rules, or was included in such a motion that was filed too late to be included in the initial hearing session, will ordinarily be treated by the Panel as a potential &ldquo;tag-along action.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any party or counsel in actions previously transferred under Section 1407 or under consideration by the Panel for transfer under Section 1407 shall promptly notify the Clerk of the Panel of any potential &ldquo;tag-along actions&rdquo; in which that party is also named or in which that counsel appears.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the absence of unusual circumstances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Actions terminated in the transferee district court by valid judgment, including but not limited to summary judgment, judgment of dismissal and judgment upon stipulation, shall not be remanded by the Panel and shall be dismissed by the transferee district court. The clerk of the transferee district court shall send a copy of the order terminating the action to the Clerk of the Panel but shall retain the original files and records unless otherwise directed by the transferee judge or by the Panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each action transferred only for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings that has not been terminated in the transferee district court shall be remanded by the Panel to the transferor district for trial. Actions that were originally filed in the transferee district require no action by the Panel to be reassigned to another judge in the transferee district at the conclusion of the coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings affecting those actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Panel shall consider remand of each transferred action or any separable claim, cross-claim, counterclaim or third-party claim at or before the conclusion of coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings on</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Panel is reluctant to order remand absent a suggestion of remand from the transferee district court. If remand is sought by motion of a party, the motion shall be accompanied by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an affidavit reciting</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the movant has requested a suggestion of remand from the transferee district court, how the court responded to any request, and, if no such request was made, why;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether all common discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been completed in the action sought to be remanded, and if not, what remains to be done; and</p>

Within five days of filing of a party's response, any party may file a reply brief limited to new matters. Failure of a party to respond to a show cause order regarding remand shall be treated as that party's acquiescence to the remand. Responses and replies shall be filed and served in conformity with Rules 5.12, 5.2 and 7.1 of these Rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Conditional Remand Orders</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) When the Panel has been advised by the transferee district judge, or otherwise has reason to believe, that pretrial proceedings in the litigation assigned to the transferee district judge are concluded or that remand of an action or actions is otherwise appropriate, an order may be entered by the Clerk of the Panel remanding the action or actions to the transferor district court. The Clerk of the Panel shall serve this order on each party to the litigation but, in order to afford all parties the opportunity to oppose remand, shall not send the order to the clerk of the transferee district court for fifteen days from the entry thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Any party opposing the remand shall file a notice of opposition with the Clerk of the Panel within the fifteen-day period. If a notice of opposition is received by the Clerk of the Panel within this fifteen-day period, the Clerk of the Panel shall not transmit said order to the clerk of the transferee district court until further order of the Panel. The Clerk of the Panel shall notify the parties of the briefing schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Within fifteen days of the filing of its notice of opposition, the party opposing remand shall file a motion to vacate the conditional remand order and brief in support thereof.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each party filing a motion or a response to a motion or order of the Panel under Rules 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 or 7.6 of these Rules may file simultaneously therewith a separate statement limited to one page setting forth reasons why oral argument should, or need not, be heard. Such statements shall be captioned &ldquo;Reasons Why Oral Argument Should [Need Not] Be Heard,&rdquo; and shall be filed and served in conformity with Rules 5.12 and 5.2 of these Rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No transfer or remand determination regarding any action pending in the district court shall be made by the Panel when any party timely opposes such transfer or remand unless a hearing session has been held for the presentation of oral argument except that the Panel may dispense with oral argument if it determines that:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.</p>

If oral argument is scheduled in a matter the Clerk of the Panel may require counsel for all parties who wish to make or to waive oral argument to file and serve notice to that effect within a stated time in conformity with Rules 5.12 and 5.2 of these Rules. Failure to do so shall be deemed a waiver of oral argument by that party. If oral argument is scheduled but not attended by a party, the matter shall not be rescheduled and that party's position shall be treated as submitted for decision by the Panel on the basis of the papers filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Except for leave of the Panel on a showing of good cause, only those parties to actions scheduled for oral argument who have filed a motion or written response to a motion or order shall be permitted to appear before the Panel and present oral argument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Counsel for those supporting transfer or remand under Section 1407 and counsel for those opposing such transfer or remand are to confer separately prior to the oral argument for the purpose of organizing their arguments and selecting representatives to present all views without duplication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Unless otherwise ordered by the Panel, a maximum of twenty minutes shall be allotted for oral argument in each matter. The time shall be divided equally among those with varying viewpoints. Counsel for the moving party or parties shall generally be heard first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) So far as practicable and consistent with the purposes of Section 1407, the offering of oral testimony before the Panel shall be avoided. Accordingly, oral testimony shall not be received except upon notice, motion and order of the Panel expressly providing for it.</p>
