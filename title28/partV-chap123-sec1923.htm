<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;571, 572, and 578 (R.S. &sect;&sect;823, 824; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, &sect;&sect;6, 24, 29 Stat. 179, 186; Feb. 26, 1919, ch. 49, &sect;1, 40 Stat. 1182; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, &sect;1, 41 Stat. 209; Feb. 11, 1921, ch. 46, 41 Stat. 1099; June 6, 1930, ch. 409, 46 Stat. 522; Aug. 3, 1935, ch. 431, &sect;1, 49 Stat. 513).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 571, 572, and 578 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;$20 on trial or final hearing in civil, criminal, or admiralty cases&rdquo; was substituted for the following provisions of section 572 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;On trial before a jury, in civil or criminal causes or before referees, or on a final hearing in equity or admiralty, a docket fee of $20&rdquo;, and the limitation of $10 in &ldquo;cases at law when judgment is rendered without a jury&rdquo; was omitted. This simplified restatement provides for a single docket fee in each case which reaches final hearing or trial. Since the docket fee is arbitrary, any limitation or distinction between law cases tried with or without a jury is unrealistic.</p>
<p class="note-body">Word &ldquo;solicitor&rdquo; was omitted as obsolete and inapplicable in civil, criminal, or admiralty practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;motion for judgment&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;scire facias&rdquo; to conform to Rules 2 and 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
