<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo; assumes importance because the term is used in the definition of hearsay in subdivision (c). The effect of the definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo; is to exclude from the operation of the hearsay rule all evidence of conduct, verbal or nonverbal, not intended as an assertion. The key to the definition is that nothing is an assertion unless intended to be one.</p>
<p class="note-body">It can scarcely be doubted that an assertion made in words is intended by the declarant to be an assertion. Hence verbal assertions readily fall into the category of &ldquo;statement.&rdquo; Whether nonverbal conduct should be regarded as a statement for purposes of defining hearsay requires further consideration. Some nonverbal conduct, such as the act of pointing to identify a suspect in a lineup, is clearly the equivalent of words, assertive in nature, and to be regarded as a statement. Other nonverbal conduct, however, may be offered as evidence that the person acted as he did because of his belief in the existence of the condition sought to be proved, from which belief the existence of the condition may be inferred. This sequence is, arguably, in effect an assertion of the existence of the condition and hence properly includable within the hearsay concept. See Morgan, Hearsay Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay Concept, 62 Harv.L. Rev. 177, 214, 217 (1948), and the elaboration in Finman, Implied Assertions as Hearsay: Some Criticisms of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, 14 Stan.L.Rev. 682 (1962). Admittedly evidence of this character is untested with respect to the perception, memory, and narration (or their equivalents) of the actor, but the Advisory Committee is of the view that these dangers are minimal in the absence of an intent to assert and do not justify the loss of the evidence on hearsay grounds. No class of evidence is free of the possibility of fabrication, but the likelihood is less with nonverbal than with assertive verbal conduct. The situations giving rise to the nonverbal conduct are such as virtually to eliminate questions of sincerity. Motivation, the nature of the conduct, and the presence or absence of reliance will bear heavily upon the weight to be given the evidence. Falknor, The &ldquo;Hear-Say&rdquo; Rule as a &ldquo;See-Do&rdquo; Rule: Evidence of Conduct, 33 Rocky Mt.L.Rev. 133 (1961). Similar considerations govern nonassertive verbal conduct and verbal conduct which is assertive but offered as a basis for inferring something other than the matter asserted, also excluded from the definition of hearsay by the language of subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">When evidence of conduct is offered on the theory that it is not a statement, and hence not hearsay, a preliminary determination will be required to determine whether an assertion is intended. The rule is so worded as to place the burden upon the party claiming that the intention existed; ambiguous and doubtful cases will be resolved against him and in favor of admissibility. The determination involves no greater difficulty than many other preliminary questions of fact. Maguire, The Hearsay System: Around and Through the Thicket, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 741, 765&ndash;767 (1961).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:402 --><p class="note-body">For similar approaches, see Uniform Rule 62(1); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;225, 1200; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(a); New Jersey Evidence Rule 62(1)</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The definition follows along familiar lines in including only statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. McCormick &sect;225; 5 Wigmore &sect;1361, 6 <em>id</em>. &sect;1766. If the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay. <em>Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp</em>., 181 F.2d 70 (7th Cir. 1950), rev'd on other grounds 340 U.S. 558, 71 S.Ct. 408, 95 L.Ed 534, letters of complaint from customers offered as a reason for cancellation of dealer's franchise, to rebut contention that franchise was revoked for refusal to finance sales through affiliated finance company. The effect is to exclude from hearsay the entire category of &ldquo;verbal acts&rdquo; and &ldquo;verbal parts of an act,&rdquo; in which the statement itself affects the legal rights of the parties or is a circumstance bearing on conduct affecting their rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of hearsay must, of course, be read with reference to the definition of statement set forth in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Testimony given by a witness in the course of court proceedings is excluded since there is compliance with all the ideal conditions for testifying.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Several types of statements which would otherwise literally fall within the definition are expressly excluded from it:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) <em>Prior statement by witness</em>. Considerable controversy has attended the question whether a prior out-of-court statement by a person now available for cross-examination concerning it, under oath and in the presence of the trier of fact, should be classed as hearsay. If the witness admits on the stand that he made the statement and that it was true, he adopts the statement and there is no hearsay problem. The hearsay problem arises when the witness on the stand denies having made the statement or admits having made it but denies its truth. The argument in favor of treating these latter statements as hearsay is based upon the ground that the conditions of oath, cross-examination, and demeanor observation did not prevail at the time the statement was made and cannot adequately be supplied by the later examination. The logic of the situation is troublesome. So far as concerns the oath, its mere presence has never been regarded as sufficient to remove a statement from the hearsay category, and it receives much less emphasis than cross-examination as a truth-compelling device. While strong expressions are found to the effect that no conviction can be had or important right taken away on the basis of statements not made under fear of prosecution for perjury, <em>Bridges v. Wixon</em>, 326 U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945), the fact is that, of the many common law exceptions to the hearsay rule, only that for reported testimony has required the statement to have been made under oath. Nor is it satisfactorily explained why cross-examination cannot be conducted subsequently with success. The decisions contending most vigorously for its inadequacy in fact demonstrate quite thorough exploration of the weaknesses and doubts attending the earlier statement. <em>State v. Saporen</em>, 205 Minn. 358, 285 N.W. 898 (1939); <em>Ruhala v. Roby</em>, 379 Mich. 102, 150 N.W.2d 146 (1967); <em>People v. Johnson</em>, 68 Cal.2d 646, 68 Cal.Rptr. 599, 441 P.2d 111 (1968). In respect to demeanor, as Judge Learned Hand observed in <em>Di Carlo v. United States</em>, 6 F.2d 364 (2d Cir. 1925), when the jury decides that the truth is not what the witness says now, but what he said before, they are still deciding from what they see and hear in court. The bulk of the case law nevertheless has been against allowing prior statements of witnesses to be used generally as substantive evidence. Most of the writers and Uniform Rule 63(1) have taken the opposite position.</p>
<p class="note-body">The position taken by the Advisory Committee in formulating this part of the rule is founded upon an unwillingness to countenance the general use of prior prepared statements as substantive evidence, but with a recognition that particular circumstances call for a contrary result. The judgment is one more of experience than of logic. The rule requires in each instance, as a general safeguard, that the declarant actually testify as a witness, and it then enumerates three situations in which the statement is excepted from the category of hearsay. Compare Uniform Rule 63(1) which allows any out-of-court statement of a declarant who is present at the trial and available for cross-examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) Prior inconsistent statements traditionally have been admissible to impeach but not as substantive evidence. Under the rule they are substantive evidence. As has been said by the California Law Revision Commission with respect to a similar provision:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Section 1235 admits inconsistent statements of witnesses because the dangers against which the hearsay rule is designed to protect are largely nonexistent. The declarant is in court and may be examined and cross-examined in regard to his statements and their subject matter. In many cases, the inconsistent statement is more likely to be true than the testimony of the witness at the trial because it was made nearer in time to the matter to which it relates and is less likely to be influenced by the controversy that gave rise to the litigation. The trier of fact has the declarant before it and can observe his demeanor and the nature of his testimony as he denies or tries to explain away the inconsistency. Hence, it is in as good a position to determine the truth or falsity of the prior statement as it is to determine the truth or falsity of the inconsistent testimony given in court. Moreover, Section 1235 will provide a party with desirable protection against the &lsquo;turncoat&rsquo; witness who changes his story on the stand and deprives the party calling him of evidence essential to his case.&rdquo; Comment, California Evidence Code &sect;1235. See also McCormick &sect;39. The Advisory Committee finds these views more convincing than those expressed in <em>People v. Johnson</em>, 68 Cal.2d 646, 68 Cal.Rptr. 599, 441 P.2d 111 (1968). The constitutionality of the Advisory Committee's view was upheld in <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). Moreover, the requirement that the statement be inconsistent with the testimony given assures a thorough exploration of both versions while the witness is on the stand and bars any general and indiscriminate use of previously prepared statements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) Prior consistent statements traditionally have been admissible to rebut charges of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive but not as substantive evidence. Under the rule they are substantive evidence. The prior statement is consistent with the testimony given on the stand, and, if the opposite party wishes to open the door for its admission in evidence, no sound reason is apparent why it should not be received generally.</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) The admission of evidence of identification finds substantial support, although it falls beyond a doubt in the category of prior out-of-court statements. Illustrative are <em>People v. Gould</em>, 54 Cal.2d 621, 7 Cal.Rptr. 273, 354 P.2d 865 (1960); <em>Judy v. State</em>, 218 Md. 168, 146 A.2d 29 (1958); <em>State v. Simmons</em>, 63 Wash.2d 17, 385 P.2d 389 (1963); California Evidence Code &sect;1238; New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(1)(c); N.Y. Code of Criminal Procedure &sect;393&ndash;b. Further cases are found in 4 Wigmore &sect;1130. The basis is the generally unsatisfactory and inconclusive nature of courtroom identifications as compared with those made at an earlier time under less suggestive conditions. The Supreme Court considered the admissibility of evidence of prior identification in <em>Gilbert v. California</em>, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967). Exclusion of lineup identification was held to be required because the accused did not then have the assistance of counsel. Significantly, the Court carefully refrained from placing its decision on the ground that testimony as to the making of a prior out-of-court identification (&ldquo;That's the man&rdquo;) violated either the hearsay rule or the right of confrontation because not made under oath, subject to immediate cross-examination, in the presence of the trier. Instead the Court observed:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:403 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;There is a split among the States concerning the admissibility of prior extra-judicial identifications, as independent evidence of identity, both by the witness and third parties present at the prior identification. See 71 ALR2d 449. It has been held that the prior identification is hearsay, and, when admitted through the testimony of the identifier, is merely a prior consistent statement. The recent trend, however, is to admit the prior identification under the exception that admits as substantive evidence a prior communication by a witness who is available for cross-examination at the trial. See 5 ALR2d Later Case Service 1225&ndash;1228. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; 388 U.S. at 272, n. 3, 87 S.Ct. at 1956.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) <em>Admissions</em>. Admissions by a party-opponent are excluded from the category of hearsay on the theory that their admissibility in evidence is the result of the adversary system rather than satisfaction of the conditions of the hearsay rule. Strahorn, A Reconsideration of the Hearsay Rule and Admissions, 85 U.Pa.L.Rev. 484, 564 (1937); Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 265 (1962); 4 Wigmore &sect;1048. No guarantee of trustworthiness is required in the case of an admission. The freedom which admissions have enjoyed from technical demands of searching for an assurance of trustworthiness in some against-interest circumstance, and from the restrictive influences of the opinion rule and the rule requiring firsthand knowledge, when taken with the apparently prevalent satisfaction with the results, calls for generous treatment of this avenue to admissibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule specifies five categories of statements for which the responsibility of a party is considered sufficient to justify reception in evidence against him:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) A party's own statement is the classic example of an admission. If he has a representative capacity and the statement is offered against him in that capacity, no inquiry whether he was acting in the representative capacity in making the statement is required; the statement need only be relevant to represent affairs. To the same effect in California Evidence Code &sect;1220. Compare Uniform Rule 63(7), requiring a statement to be made in a representative capacity to be admissible against a party in a representative capacity.</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) Under established principles an admission may be made by adopting or acquiescing in the statement of another. While knowledge of contents would ordinarily be essential, this is not inevitably so: &ldquo;X is a reliable person and knows what he is talking about.&rdquo; See McCormick &sect;246, p. 527, n. 15. Adoption or acquiescence may be manifested in any appropriate manner. When silence is relied upon, the theory is that the person would, under the circumstances, protest the statement made in his presence, if untrue. The decision in each case calls for an evaluation in terms of probable human behavior. In civil cases, the results have generally been satisfactory. In criminal cases, however, troublesome questions have been raised by decisions holding that failure to deny is an admission: the inference is a fairly weak one, to begin with; silence may be motivated by advice of counsel or realization that &ldquo;anything you say may be used against you&rdquo;; unusual opportunity is afforded to manufacture evidence; and encroachment upon the privilege against self-incrimination seems inescapably to be involved. However, recent decisions of the Supreme Court relating to custodial interrogation and the right to counsel appear to resolve these difficulties. Hence the rule contains no special provisions concerning failure to deny in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) No authority is required for the general proposition that a statement authorized by a party to be made should have the status of an admission by the party. However, the question arises whether only statements to third persons should be so regarded, to the exclusion of statements by the agent to the principal. The rule is phrased broadly so as to encompass both. While it may be argued that the agent authorized to make statements to his principal does not speak for him, Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 273 (1962), communication to an outsider has not generally been thought to be an essential characteristic of an admission. Thus a party's books or records are usable against him, without regard to any intent to disclose to third persons. 5 Wigmore &sect;1557. See also McCormick &sect;78, pp. 159&ndash;161. In accord is New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(8)(a). Cf. Uniform Rule 63(8)(a) and California Evidence Code &sect;1222 which limit status as an admission in this regard to statements authorized by the party to be made &ldquo;for&rdquo; him, which is perhaps an ambiguous limitation to statements to third persons. Falknor, Vicarious Admissions and the Uniform Rules, 14 Vand.L. Rev. 855, 860&ndash;861 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">(D) The tradition has been to test the admissibility of statements by agents, as admissions, by applying the usual test of agency. Was the admission made by the agent acting in the scope of his employment? Since few principals employ agents for the purpose of making damaging statements, the usual result was exclusion of the statement. Dissatisfaction with this loss of valuable and helpful evidence has been increasing. A substantial trend favors admitting statements related to a matter within the scope of the agency or employment. <em>Grayson v. Williams</em>, 256 F.2d 61 (10th Cir. 1958); <em>Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines v. Tuller</em>, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 292 F.2d 775, 784 (1961); <em>Martin v. Savage Truck Lines, Inc</em>., 121 F.Supp. 417 (D.D.C. 1054), and numerous state court decisions collected in 4 Wigmore, 1964 Supp., pp. 66&ndash;73, with comments by the editor that the statements should have been excluded as not within scope of agency. For the traditional view see <em>Northern Oil Co. v. Socony Mobile Oil Co</em>., 347 F.2d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 1965) and cases cited therein. Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63(9)(a), Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(i)(1), and New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(9)(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">(E) The limitation upon the admissibility of statements of co-conspirators to those made &ldquo;during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy&rdquo; is in the accepted pattern. While the broadened view of agency taken in item (iv) might suggest wider admissibility of statements of co-conspirators, the agency theory of conspiracy is at best a fiction and ought not to serve as a basis for admissibility beyond that already established. See Levie, Hearsay and Conspiracy, 52 Mich.L.Rev. 1159 (1954); Comment, 25 U.Chi.L.Rev. 530 (1958). The rule is consistent with the position of the Supreme Court in denying admissibility to statements made after the objectives of the conspiracy have either failed or been achieved. <em>Krulewitch v. United States</em>, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949); <em>Wong Sun v. United States</em>, 371 U.S. 471, 490, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). For similarly limited provisions see California Evidence Code &sect;1223 and New Jersey Rule 63(9)(b). Cf. Uniform Rule 63(9)(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Present federal law, except in the Second Circuit, permits the use of prior inconsistent statements of a witness for impeachment only. Rule 801(d)(1) as proposed by the Court would have permitted all such statements to be admissible as substantive evidence, an approach followed by a small but growing number of State jurisdictions and recently held constitutional in <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149 (1970). Although there was some support expressed for the Court Rule, based largely on the need to counteract the effect of witness intimidation in criminal cases, the Committee decided to adopt a compromise version of the Rule similar to the position of the Second Circuit. The Rule as amended draws a distinction between types of prior inconsistent statements (other than statements of identification of a person made after perceiving him which are currently admissible, see <em>United States v. Anderson</em>, 406 F.2d 719, 720 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 967 (1969)) and allows only those made while the declarant was subject to cross-examination at a trial or hearing or in a deposition, to be admissible for their truth. Compare <em>United States v. DeSisto</em>, 329 F.2d 929 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 979 (1964); <em>United States v. Cunningham</em>, 446 F.2d 194 (2nd Cir. 1971) (restricting the admissibility of prior in<!-- PDFPage:404 -->consistent statements as substantive evidence to those made under oath in a formal proceeding, but not requiring that there have been an opportunity for cross-examination). The rationale for the Committee's decision is that (1) unlike in most other situations involving unsworn or oral statements, there can be no dispute as to whether the prior statement was made; and (2) the context of a formal proceeding, an oath, and the opportunity for cross-examination provide firm additional assurances of the reliability of the prior statement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 801 defines what is and what is not hearsay for the purpose of admitting a prior statement as substantive evidence. A prior statement of a witness at a trial or hearing which is inconsistent with his testimony is, of course, always admissible for the purpose of impeaching the witness&rsquo; credibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">As submitted by the Supreme Court, subdivision (d)(1)(A) made admissible as substantive evidence the prior statement of a witness inconsistent with his present testimony.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House severely limited the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements by adding a requirement that the prior statement must have been subject to cross-examination, thus precluding even the use of grand jury statements. The requirement that the prior statement must have been subject to cross-examination appears unnecessary since this rule comes into play only when the witness testifies in the present trial. At that time, he is on the stand and can explain an earlier position and be cross-examined as to both.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the statement be under oath also appears unnecessary. Notwithstanding the absence of an oath contemporaneous with the statement, the witness, when on the stand, qualifying or denying the prior statement, is under oath. In any event, of all the many recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, only one (former testimony) requires that the out-of-court statement have been made under oath. With respect to the lack of evidence of the demeanor of the witness at the time of the prior statement, it would be difficult to improve upon Judge Learned Hand's observation that when the jury decides that the truth is not what the witness says now but what he said before, they are still deciding from what they see and hear in court [<em>Di Carlo v. U.S</em>., 6 F.2d 364 (2d Cir. 1925)].</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule as submitted by the Court has positive advantages. The prior statement was made nearer in time to the events, when memory was fresher and intervening influences had not been brought into play. A realistic method is provided for dealing with the turncoat witness who changes his story on the stand [see Comment, California Evidence Code &sect;1235; McCormick, Evidence, &sect;38 (2nd ed. 1972)].</p>
<p class="note-body">New Jersey, California, and Utah have adopted a rule similar to this one; and Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin have adopted the identical Federal rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">For all of these reasons, we think the House amendment should be rejected and the rule as submitted by the Supreme Court reinstated. [It would appear that some of the opposition to this Rule is based on a concern that a person could be convicted solely upon evidence admissible under this Rule. The Rule, however, is not addressed to the question of the sufficiency of evidence to send a case to the jury, but merely as to its admissibility. Factual circumstances could well arise where, if this were the sole evidence, dismissal would be appropriate].</p>
<p class="note-body">As submitted by the Supreme Court and as passed by the House, subdivision (d)(1)(c) of rule 801 made admissible the prior statement identifying a person made after perceiving him. The committee decided to delete this provision because of the concern that a person could be convicted solely upon evidence admissible under this subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House approved the long-accepted rule that &ldquo;a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy&rdquo; is not hearsay as it was submitted by the Supreme Court. While the rule refers to a coconspirator, it is this committee's understanding that the rule is meant to carry forward the universally accepted doctrine that a joint venturer is considered as a coconspirator for the purposes of this rule even though no conspiracy has been charged. <em>United States v. Rinaldi</em>, 393 F.2d 97, 99 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 393 U.S. 913 (1968); <em>United States v. Spencer</em>, 415 F.2d 1301, 1304 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 801 supplies some basic definitions for the rules of evidence that deal with hearsay. Rule 801(d)(1) defines certain statements as not hearsay. The Senate amendments make two changes in it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill provides that a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement and if the statement is inconsistent with his testimony and was given under oath subject to cross-examination and subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or hearing or in a deposition. The Senate amendment drops the requirement that the prior statement be given under oath subject to cross-examination and subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or hearing or in a deposition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment, so that the rule now requires that the prior inconsistent statement be given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition. The rule as adopted covers statements before a grand jury. Prior inconsistent statements may, of course, be used for impeaching the credibility of a witness. When the prior inconsistent statement is one made by a defendant in a criminal case, it is covered by Rule 801(d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill provides that a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement and the statement is one of identification of a person made after perceiving him. The Senate amendment eliminated this provision.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 801(d)(2) has been amended in order to respond to three issues raised by <em>Bourjaily v. United States</em>, 483 U.S. 171 (1987). First, the amendment codifies the holding in <em>Bourjaily</em> by stating expressly that a court shall consider the contents of a coconspirator's statement in determining &ldquo;the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered.&rdquo; According to <em>Bourjaily</em>, Rule 104(a) requires these preliminary questions to be established by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, the amendment resolves an issue on which the Court had reserved decision. It provides that the contents of the declarant's statement do not alone suffice to establish a conspiracy in which the declarant and the defendant participated. The court must consider in addition the circumstances surrounding the statement, such as the identity of the speaker, the context in which the statement was made, or evidence corroborating the contents of the statement in making its determination as to each preliminary question. This amendment is in accordance with existing practice. Every court of appeals that has resolved this issue requires some evidence in addition to the contents of the statement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Beckham</em>, 968 F.2d 47, 51 (D.C.Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Sepulveda</em>, 15 F.3d 1161, 1181&ndash;82 (1st Cir. 1993), <em>cert. denied</em>, 114 S.Ct. 2714 (1994); <em>United States v. Daly</em>, 842 F.2d 1380, 1386 (2d Cir.), <!-- PDFPage:405 --><em>cert. denied</em>, 488 U.S. 821 (1988); <em>United States v. Clark</em>, 18 F.3d 1337, 1341&ndash;42 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 115 S.Ct. 152 (1994); <em>United States v. Zambrana</em>, 841 F.2d 1320, 1344&ndash;45 (7th Cir. 1988); <em>United States v. Silverman</em>, 861 F.2d 571, 577 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>United States v. Gordon</em>, 844 F.2d 1397, 1402 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>United States v. Hernandez</em>, 829 F.2d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied</em>, 485 U.S. 1013 (1988); <em>United States v. Byrom</em>, 910 F.2d 725, 736 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, the amendment extends the reasoning of <em>Bourjaily</em> to statements offered under subdivisions (C) and (D) of Rule 801(d)(2). In <em>Bourjaily</em>, the Court rejected treating foundational facts pursuant to the law of agency in favor of an evidentiary approach governed by Rule 104(a). The Advisory Committee believes it appropriate to treat analogously preliminary questions relating to the declarant's authority under subdivision (C), and the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision (D).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 801</em>. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was substituted for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 19. The second sentence of the committee note was changed accordingly.</p>
