<h3 class="section-head">Rule 41. Issuance of Mandate; Stay of Mandate</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>Date of Issuance</em>.&mdash;The mandate of the court must issue 7 days after the expiration of the time for filing a petition for rehearing unless such a petition is filed or the time is shortened <!-- PDFPage:43 -->or enlarged by order. A certified copy of the judgment and a copy of the opinion of the court, if any, and any direction as to costs shall constitute the mandate, unless the court directs that a formal mandate issue. The timely filing of a petition for rehearing will stay the mandate until disposition of the petition unless otherwise ordered by the court. If the petition is denied, the mandate must issue 7 days after entry of the order denying the petition unless the time is shortened or enlarged by order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Stay of Mandate Pending Petition for Certiorari</em>.&mdash;A party who files a motion requesting a stay of mandate pending petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari must file, at the same time, proof of service on all other parties. The motion must show that a petition for certiorari would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay. The stay cannot exceed 30 days unless the period is extended for cause shown or unless during the period of the stay, a notice from the clerk of the Supreme Court is filed showing that the party who has obtained the stay has filed a petition for the writ, in which case the stay will continue until final disposition by the Supreme Court. The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed. The court may require a bond or other security as a condition to the grant or continuance of a stay of the mandate.</p>

<p class="note-body">The proposed rule follows the rule or practice in a majority of circuits by which copies of the opinion and the judgment serve in lieu of a formal mandate in the ordinary case. Compare Supreme Court Rule 59. Although 28 U.S.C. &sect;2101(c) permits a writ of certiorari to be filed within 90 days after entry of judgment, seven of the eight circuits which now regulate the matter of stays pending application for certiorari limit the initial stay of the mandate to the 30-day period provided in the proposed rule. Compare D.C. Cir. Rule 27(e).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment conforms Rule 41(a) to the amendment made to Rule 40(a). The amendment keys the time for issuance of the mandate to the expiration of the time for filing a petition for rehearing, unless such a petition is filed in which case the mandate issues 7 days after the entry of the order denying the petition. Because the amendment to Rule 40(a) lengthens the time for filing a petition for rehearing in civil cases involving the United States from 14 to 45 days, the rule requiring the mandate to issue 21 days after the entry of judgment would cause the mandate to issue while the government is still considering requesting a rehearing. Therefore, the amendment generally requires the mandate to issue 7 days after the expiration of the time for filing a petition for rehearing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The amendment requires a party who files a motion requesting a stay of mandate to file, at the same time, proof of service on all other parties. The old rule required the party to give notice to the other parties; the amendment merely requires the party to provide the court with evidence of having done so.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also states that the motion must show that a petition for certiorari would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay. The amendment is intended to alert the parties to the fact that a stay of mandate is not granted automatically and to the type of showing that needs to be made. The Supreme Court has established conditions that must be met before it will stay a mandate. <em>See</em> Robert L. Stern et al., <em>Supreme Court Practice</em> &sect;17.19 (6th ed. 1986).</p>
