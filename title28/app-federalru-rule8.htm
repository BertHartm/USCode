<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Motion for Stay.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <strong>Initial Motion in the District Court.</strong> A party must ordinarily move first in the district court for the following relief:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) approval of a supersedeas bond; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <strong>Motion in the Court of Appeals; Conditions on Relief.</strong> A motion for the relief mentioned in Rule 8(a)(1) may be made to the court of appeals or to one of its judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The motion must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) show that moving first in the district court would be impracticable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) state that, a motion having been made, the district court denied the motion or failed to afford the relief requested and state any reasons given by the district court for its action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The motion must also include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) relevant parts of the record.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A motion under this Rule 8(a)(2) must be filed with the circuit clerk and normally will be considered by a panel of the court. But in an exceptional case in which time requirements make that procedure impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a single judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The court may condition relief on a party's filing a bond or other appropriate security in the district court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Proceeding Against a Surety.</strong> If a party gives security in the form of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction of the district court and irrevocably appoints the district clerk as the surety's agent on whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. On motion, a surety's liability may be enforced in the district court without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and any notice that the district court prescribes may be served on the district clerk, who must promptly mail a copy to each surety whose address is known.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Stay in a Criminal Case.</strong> Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs a stay in a criminal case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. While the power of a court of appeals to stay proceedings in the district court during the pendency of an appeal is not explicitly conferred by statute, it exists by virtue of the all writs statute, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651. <em>Eastern Greyhound Lines v. Fusco</em>, 310 F.2d 632 (6th Cir., 1962); <em>United States v. Lynd</em>, 301 F.2d 818 (5th Cir., 1962); <em>Public Utilities Commission of Dist. of Col. v. Capital Transit Co</em>., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 214 F.2d 242 (1954). And the Supreme Court has termed the power &ldquo;inherent&rdquo; (<em>In re McKenzie</em>, 180 U.S. 536, 551, 21 S.Ct. 468, 45 L.Ed. 657 (1901)) and &ldquo;part of its (the court of appeals) traditional equipment for the administration of justice.&rdquo; (<em>Scripps-Howard Radio v. F.C.C</em>., 316 U.S. 4, 9&ndash;10, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942)). The power of a single judge of the court of appeals to grant a stay pending appeal was recognized in <em>In re McKenzie, supra. Alexander v. United States</em>, 173 F.2d 865 (9th Cir., 1949) held that a single judge could not stay the judgment of a district court, but it noted the absence of a rule of court authorizing the practice. FRCP 62(g) adverts to the grant of a stay by a single judge of the appellate court. The requirement that application be first made to the district court is the case law rule. <em>Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission</em>, 260 U.S. 212, 219, 43 S.Ct. 75, 67 L.Ed. 217 (1922); <em>United States v. El-O-Pathic Pharmacy</em>, 192 F.2d 62 (9th Cir., 1951); <em>United States v. Hansell</em>, 109 F.2d 613 (2d Cir., 1940). The requirement is explicitly stated in FRCrP 38(c) and in <!-- PDFPage:20 -->the rules of the First, Third, Fourth and Tenth Circuits. See also Supreme Court Rules 18 and 27.</p>
<p class="note-body">The statement of the requirement in the proposed rule would work a minor change in present practice. FRCP 73(e) requires that if a bond for costs on appeal or a supersedeas bond is offered after the appeal is docketed, leave to file the bond must be obtained from the court of appeals. There appears to be no reason why matters relating to supersedeas and cost bonds should not be initially presented to the district court whenever they arise prior to the disposition of the appeal. The requirement of FRCP 73(e) appears to be a concession to the view that once an appeal is perfected, the district court loses all power over its judgment. See <em>In re Federal Facilities Trust, </em>227 F.2d 651 (7th Cir., 1955) and cases&mdash;cited at 654&ndash;655. No reason appears why all questions related to supersedeas or the bond for costs on appeal should not be presented in the first instance to the district court in the ordinary case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The provisions respecting a surety upon a bond or other undertaking are based upon FRCP 65.1.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rule 8(b) are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment conforms subdivision (c) to previous amendments to Fed. R. Crim. P. 38. This amendment strikes the reference to subdivision (a) of Fed. R. Crim. P. 38 so that Fed. R. App. P. 8(c) refers instead to all of Criminal Rule 38. When Rule 8(c) was adopted Fed. R. Crim. P. 38(a) included the procedures for obtaining a stay of execution when the sentence in question was death, imprisonment, a fine, or probation. Criminal Rule 38 was later amended and now addresses those topics in separate subdivisions. Subdivision 38(a) now addresses only stays of death sentences. The proper cross reference is to all of Criminal Rule 38.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
