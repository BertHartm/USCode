<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. Stay or Injunction Pending Appeal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>Stay must ordinarily be sought in the first instance in district court; motion for stay in court of appeals</em>.&mdash;Application for a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal, or for approval of a supersedeas bond, or for an order suspending, modifying, restoring or granting an injunction during the pendency of an appeal must ordinarily be made in the first instance in the district court. A motion for such relief may be made to the court of appeals or to a judge thereof, but the motion shall show that application to the district court for the relief sought is not practicable, or that the district court has denied an application, or has failed to afford the relief which the applicant requested, with the reasons given by the district court for its action. The motion shall also show the reasons for the relief requested and the facts relied upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute the motion shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements or copies thereof. With the motion shall be filed such parts of the record as are relevant. Reasonable notice of the motion shall be given to all parties. The motion shall be filed with the clerk and normally will be considered by a panel or division of the court, but in exceptional cases where such procedure would be impracticable due to the requirements of time, the application <!-- PDFPage:15 -->may be made to and considered by a single judge of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Stay may be conditioned upon giving of bond; proceedings against sureties</em>.&mdash;Relief available in the court of appeals under this rule may be conditioned upon the filing of a bond or other appropriate security in the district court. If security is given in the form of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction of the district court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the district court as the surety's agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. A surety's liability may be enforced on motion in the district court without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and such notice of the motion as the district court prescribes may be served on the clerk of the district court, who shall forthwith mail copies to the sureties if their addresses are known.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <em>Stay in a Criminal Case</em>.&mdash;A stay in a criminal case shall be had in accordance with the provisions of Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a</em>). While the power of a court of appeals to stay proceedings in the district court during the pendency of an appeal is not explicitly conferred by statute, it exists by virtue of the all writs statute, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651. <em>Eastern Greyhound Lines v. Fusco</em>, 310 F.2d 632 (6th Cir., 1962); <em>United States v. Lynd</em>, 301 F.2d 818 (5th Cir., 1962); <em>Public Utilities Commission of Dist. of Col. v. Capital Transit Co</em>., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 214 F.2d 242 (1954). And the Supreme Court has termed the power &ldquo;inherent&rdquo; (<em>In re McKenzie</em>, 180 U.S. 536, 551, 21 S.Ct. 468, 45 L.Ed. 657 (1901)) and &ldquo;part of its (the court of appeals) traditional equipment for the administration of justice.&rdquo; (<em>Scripps-Howard Radio v. F.C.C</em>., 316 U.S. 4, 9&ndash;10, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942)). The power of a single judge of the court of appeals to grant a stay pending appeal was recognized in <em>In re McKenzie, supra. Alexander v. United States</em>, 173 F.2d 865 (9th Cir., 1949) held that a single judge could not stay the judgment of a district court, but it noted the absence of a rule of court authorizing the practice. FRCP 62(g) adverts to the grant of a stay by a single judge of the appellate court. The requirement that application be first made to the district court is the case law rule. <em>Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission</em>, 260 U.S. 212, 219, 43 S.Ct. 75, 67 L.Ed. 217 (1922); <em>United States v. El-O-Pathic Pharmacy</em>, 192 F.2d 62 (9th Cir., 1951); <em>United States v. Hansell</em>, 109 F.2d 613 (2d Cir., 1940). The requirement is explicitly stated in FRCrP 38(c) and in the rules of the First, Third, Fourth and Tenth Circuits. See also Supreme Court Rules 18 and 27.</p>
<p class="note-body">The statement of the requirement in the proposed rule would work a minor change in present practice. FRCP 73(e) requires that if a bond for costs on appeal or a supersedeas bond is offered after the appeal is docketed, leave to file the bond must be obtained from the court of appeals. There appears to be no reason why matters relating to supersedeas and cost bonds should not be initially presented to the district court whenever they arise prior to the disposition of the appeal. The requirement of FRCP 73(e) appears to be a concession to the view that once an appeal is perfected, the district court loses all power over its judgment. See <em>In re Federal Facilities Trust, </em>227 F.2d 651 (7th Cir., 1955) and cases&mdash;cited at 654&ndash;655. No reason appears why all questions related to supersedeas or the bond for costs on appeal should not be presented in the first instance to the district court in the ordinary case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b</em>). The provisions respecting a surety upon a bond or other undertaking are based upon FRCP 65.1.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rule 8(b) are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment conforms subdivision (c) to previous amendments to Fed. R. Crim. P. 38. This amendment strikes the reference to subdivision (a) of Fed. R. Crim. P. 38 so that Fed. R. App. P. 8(c) refers instead to all of Criminal Rule 38. When Rule 8(c) was adopted Fed. R. Crim. P. 38(a) included the procedures for obtaining a stay of execution when the sentence in question was death, imprisonment, a fine, or probation. Criminal Rule 38 was later amended and now addresses those topics in separate subdivisions. Subdivision 38(a) now addresses only stays of death sentences. The proper cross reference is to all of Criminal Rule 38.</p>
