<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition; Form</cap-smallcap>. &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties</cap-smallcap>. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Demand for Judgment</cap-smallcap>. A judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment. Except as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party's pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Costs; Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Costs Other than Attorneys&rsquo; Fees</em>. Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs other than attorneys&rsquo; fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs; but costs against the United States, its officers, and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent <!-- PDFPage:190 -->permitted by law. Such costs may be taxed by the clerk on one day's notice. On motion served within 5 days thereafter, the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Claims for attorneys&rsquo; fees and related nontaxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive law governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court, the motion must be filed and served no later than 14 days after entry of judgment; must specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the moving party to the award; and must state the amount or provide a fair estimate of the amount sought. If directed by the court, the motion shall also disclose the terms of any agreement with respect to fees to be paid for the services for which claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) On request of a party or class member, the court shall afford an opportunity for adversary submissions with respect to the motion in accordance with Rule 43(e) or Rule 78. The court may determine issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions bearing on issues of evaluation of services for which liability is imposed by the court. The court shall find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in Rule 52(a), and a judgment shall be set forth in a separate document as provided in Rule 58.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) By local rule the court may establish special procedures by which issues relating to such fees may be resolved without extensive evidentiary hearings. In addition, the court may refer issues relating to the value of services to a special master under Rule 53 without regard to the provisions of subdivision (b) thereof and may refer a motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees to a magistrate judge under Rule 72(b) as if it were a dispositive pretrial matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The provisions of subparagraphs (A) through (D) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violations of these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a</em>). The second sentence is derived substantially from [former] Equity Rule 71 (Form of Decree).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b</em>). This provides for the separate judgment of equity and code practice. See Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;270.54; Compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;476.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c</em>). For the limitation on default contained in the first sentence, see 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7680; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;479. Compare <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 13, r.r. 3&ndash;12. The remainder is a usual code provision. It makes clear that a judgment should give the relief to which a party is entitled, regardless of whether it is legal or equitable or both. This necessarily includes the deficiency judgment in foreclosure cases formerly provided for by Equity Rule 10 (Decree for Deficiency in Foreclosures, Etc.).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d</em>). For the present rule in common law actions, see <em>Ex parte Peterson</em>, 253 U.S. 300, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920); Payne, <em>Costs in Common Law Actions in the Federal Courts</em> (1935), 21 Va.L.Rev. 397.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The historic rule in the federal courts has always prohibited piecemeal disposal of litigation and permitted appeals only from final judgments except in those special instances covered by statute. <em>Hohorst v. Hamburg-American Packet Co</em>. (1893) 148 U.S. 262; <em>Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co</em>. (1913) 228 U.S. 339; <em>Collins v. Miller</em> (1920) 252 U.S. 364. Rule 54(b) was originally adopted in view of the wide scope and possible content of the newly created &ldquo;civil action&rdquo; in order to avoid the possible injustice of a delay in judgment of a distinctly separate claim to await adjudication of the entire case. It was not designed to overturn the settled federal rule stated above, which, indeed, has more recently been reiterated in <em>Catlin v. United States</em> (1945) 324 U.S. 229. See also <em>United States v. Florian</em> (1941) 312 U.S. 656, rev'g (and restoring the first opinion in) <em>Florian v. United States</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1940) 114 F.(2d) 990; <em>Reeves v. Beardall</em> (1942) 316 U.S. 283.</p>
<p class="note-body">Unfortunately, this was not always understood, and some confusion ensued. Hence situations arose where district courts made a piecemeal disposition of an action and entered what the parties thought amounted to a judgment, although a trial remained to be had on other claims similar or identical with those disposed of. In the interim the parties did not know their ultimate rights, and accordingly took an appeal, thus putting the finality of the partial judgment in question. While most appellate courts have reached a result generally in accord with the intent of the rule, yet there have been divergent precedents and division of views which have served to render the issues more clouded to the parties appellant. It hardly seems a case where multiplicity of precedents will tend to remove the problem from debate. The problem is presented and discussed in the following cases: <em>Atwater v. North American Coal Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 125; <em>Rosenblum v. Dingfelder</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 406; <em>Audi-Vision, Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., Inc</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 621; <em>Zalkind v. Scheinman</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 139 F.(2d) 895; <em>Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young & Co., Inc</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 144 F.(2d) 387; <em>Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Industrial Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 814, cert. den. (1946) 66 S.Ct. 1353; <em>Zarati Steamship Co. v. Park Bridge Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 377; <em>Baltimore and Ohio R. Co. v. United Fuel Gas Co</em>. (C.C.A.4th, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 545; <em>Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1941) 122 F.(2d) 124; <em>Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1942) 130 F.(2d) 535; <em>Markham v. Kasper</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1945) 152 F.(2d) 270; <em>Hanney v. Franklin Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia</em> (C.C.A.9th, 1944) 142 F.(2d) 864; <em>Toomey v. Toomey</em> (App.D.C. 1945) 149 F.(2d) 19.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of the difficulty thus disclosed, the Advisory Committee in its two preliminary drafts of proposed amendments attempted to redefine the original rule with particular stress upon the interlocutory nature of partial judgments which did not adjudicate all claims arising out of a single transaction or occurrence. This attempt appeared to meet with almost universal approval from those of the profession commenting upon it, although there were, of course, helpful suggestions for additional changes in language or clarification of detail. But <em>cf</em>. Circuit Judge Frank's dissenting opinion in <em>Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Industrial Corp., supra</em>, n. 21 of the dissenting opinion. The Committee, however, became convinced on careful study of its own proposals that the seeds of ambiguity still remained, and that it had not completely solved the problem of piecemeal appeals. After extended consideration, it concluded that a retention of the older federal rule was desirable, and that this rule needed only the exercise of a discretionary power to afford a remedy in the infrequent harsh case to provide a simple, definite, workable rule. This is afforded by amended Rule 54(b). It re-establishes an ancient policy with clarity and precision. For the possibility of staying execution where not all claims are disposed of under Rule 54(b), see amended Rule 62(h).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1961 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule permitting appeal, upon the trial court's determination of &ldquo;no just reason for delay,&rdquo; from a judgment upon one or more but fewer than all the claims in an action, has generally been given a sympathetic construction by the courts and its validity is settled. <em>Reeves v. Beardall</em>, 316 U.S. 283 (1942); <em>Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey</em>, 351 U.S. 427 (1956); <em>Cold Metal Process Co. v. United Engineering & Foundry Co</em>., 351 U.S. 445 (1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">A serious difficulty has, however, arisen because the rule speaks of claims but nowhere mentions parties. A line of cases has developed in the circuits consistently holding the rule to be inapplicable to the dismissal, even with the requisite trial court determination, of one or more but fewer than all defendants jointly charged in an action, <em>i.e</em>. charged with various forms of concerted or related wrongdoing or related liability. See <em>Mull v. Ackerman</em>, 279 F.2d 25 (2d Cir. 1960); <em>Richards v. Smith</em>, 276 F.2d 652 (5th Cir. 1960); <em>Hardy v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co</em>., 222 F.2d 827 (7th Cir. 1955); <em>Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp</em>., 220 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1955). For purposes of Rule 54(b) it was arguable that there were as many &ldquo;claims&rdquo; as there were parties defendant and that the rule in its present text applied where less than all of the parties were dismissed, <em>cf. United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc</em>., 221 F.2d 213, 215 (2d Cir. 1955); <em>Bowling Machines, Inc. v. First Nat. Bank</em>, 283 F.2d 39 (1st Cir. 1960); but the Courts of Appeals are now committed to an opposite view.</p>
<p class="note-body">The danger of hardship through delay of appeal until the whole action is concluded may be at least as serious in the multiple-parties situations as in multiple-claims cases, see <em>Pabellon v. Grace Line, Inc</em>., 191 F.2d 169, 179 (2d Cir. 1951), <em>cert. denied</em>, 342 U.S. 893 (1951), and courts and commentators have urged that Rule 54(b) be changed to take in the former. See <em>Reagan v. Traders & General Ins. Co</em>., 255 F.2d 845 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Meadows v. Greyhound Corp</em>., 235 F.2d 233 (5th Cir. 1956); <em>Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., supra</em>; 6 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;54.34[2] (2d ed. 1953); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;1193.2 (Wright ed. 1958); <em>Developments in the Law&mdash;Multiparty Litigation</em>, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 874, 981 (1958); Note, 62 Yale L.J. 263, 271 (1953); Ill.Ann.Stat. ch. 110, &sect;50(2) (Smith-Hurd 1956). The amendment accomplishes this purpose by referring explicitly to parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">There has been some recent indication that interlocutory appeal under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b), added in 1958, may now be available for the multiple-parties cases here considered. See <em>Jaftex Corp. v. Randolph Mills, Inc</em>., 282 F.2d 508 (2d Cir. 1960). The Rule 54(b) procedure seems preferable for those cases, and &sect;1292(b) should be held inapplicable to them when the rule is enlarged as here proposed. See <em>Luckenbach Steamship Co., Inc., v. H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc</em>., 280 F.2d 755, 757 (2d Cir. 1960); 1 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>supra</em>, &sect;58.1, p. 321 (Wright ed. 1960).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:192 --><h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This revision adds paragraph (2) to this subdivision to provide for a frequently recurring form of litigation not initially contemplated by the rules&mdash;disputes over the amount of attorneys&rsquo; fees to be awarded in the large number of actions in which prevailing parties may be entitled to such awards or in which the court must determine the fees to be paid from a common fund. This revision seeks to harmonize and clarify procedures that have been developed through case law and local rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. Former subdivision (d), providing for taxation of costs by the clerk, is renumbered as paragraph (1) and revised to exclude applications for attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em>. This new paragraph establishes a procedure for presenting claims for attorneys&rsquo; fees, whether or not denominated as &ldquo;costs.&rdquo; It applies also to requests for reimbursement of expenses, not taxable as costs, when recoverable under governing law incident to the award of fees. <em>Cf. West Virginia Univ. Hosp. v. Casey</em>, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; U.S. &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (1991), holding, prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, that expert witness fees were not recoverable under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1988. As noted in subparagraph (A), it does not, however, apply to fees recoverable as an element of damages, as when sought under the terms of a contract; such damages typically are to be claimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be resolved by a jury. Nor, as provided in subparagraph (E), does it apply to awards of fees as sanctions authorized or mandated under these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (B) provides a deadline for motions for attorneys&rsquo; fees&mdash;14 days after final judgment unless the court or a statute specifies some other time. One purpose of this provision is to assure that the opposing party is informed of the claim before the time for appeal has elapsed. Prior law did not prescribe any specific time limit on claims for attorneys&rsquo; fees. <em>White v. New Hampshire Dep't of Employment Sec</em>., 455 U.S. 445 (1982). In many nonjury cases the court will want to consider attorneys&rsquo; fee issues immediately after rendering its judgment on the merits of the case. Note that the time for making claims is specifically stated in some legislation, such as the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(d)(1)(B) (30-day filing period).</p>
<p class="note-body">Prompt filing affords an opportunity for the court to resolve fee disputes shortly after trial, while the services performed are freshly in mind. It also enables the court in appropriate circumstances to make its ruling on a fee request in time for any appellate review of a dispute over fees to proceed at the same time as review on the merits of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Filing a motion for fees under this subdivision does not affect the finality or the appealability of a judgment, though revised Rule 58 provides a mechanism by which prior to appeal the court can suspend the finality to resolve a motion for fees. If an appeal on the merits of the case is taken, the court may rule on the claim for fees, may defer its ruling on the motion, or may deny the motion without prejudice, directing under subdivision (d)(2)(B) a new period for filing after the appeal has been resolved. A notice of appeal does not extend the time for filing a fee claim based on the initial judgment, but the court under subdivision (d)(2)(B) may effectively extend the period by permitting claims to be filed after resolution of the appeal. A new period for filing will automatically begin if a new judgment is entered following a reversal or remand by the appellate court or the granting of a motion under Rule 59.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not require that the motion be supported at the time of filing with the evidentiary material bearing on the fees. This material must of course be submitted in due course, according to such schedule as the court may direct in light of the circumstances of the case. What is required is the filing of a motion sufficient to alert the adversary and the court that there is a claim for fees and the amount of such fees (or a fair estimate).</p>
<p class="note-body">If directed by the court, the moving party is also required to disclose any fee agreement, including those between attorney and client, between attorneys sharing a fee to be awarded, and between adversaries made in partial settlement of a dispute where the settlement must be implemented by court action as may be required by Rules 23(e) and 23.1 or other like provisions. With respect to the fee arrangements requiring court approval, the court may also by local rule require disclosure immediately after such arrangements are agreed to. <em>E.g</em>., Rule 5 of United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York; <em>cf. In re &ldquo;Agent Orange&rdquo; Product Liability Litigation (MDL 381)</em>, 611 F. Supp. 1452, 1464 (E.D.N.Y. 1985).</p>
<p class="note-body">In the settlement of class actions resulting in a common fund from which fees will be sought, courts frequently have required that claims for fees be presented in advance of hearings to consider approval of the proposed settlement. The rule does not affect this practice, as it permits the court to require submissions of fee claims in advance of entry of judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (C) assures the parties of an opportunity to make an appropriate presentation with respect to issues involving the evaluation of legal services. In some cases, an evidentiary hearing may be needed, but this is not required in every case. The amount of time to be allowed for the preparation of submissions both in support of and in opposition to awards should be tailored to the particular case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court is explicitly authorized to make a determination of the liability for fees before receiving submissions by the parties bearing on the amount of an award. This option may be appropriate in actions in which the liability issue is doubtful and the evaluation issues are numerous and complex.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may order disclosure of additional information, such as that bearing on prevailing local rates or on the appropriateness of particular services for which compensation is sought.</p>
<p class="note-body">On rare occasion, the court may determine that discovery under Rules 26&ndash;37 would be useful to the parties. <em>Compare</em> Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the U.S. District Courts, Rule 6. <em>See</em> Note, <em>Determining the Reasonableness of Attorneys&rsquo; Fees&mdash;the Discoverability of Billing Records</em>, 64 <em>B.U.L. Rev</em>. 241 (1984). In complex fee disputes, the court may use case management techniques to limit the scope of the dispute or to facilitate the settlement of fee award disputes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fee awards should be made in the form of a separate judgment under Rule 58 since such awards are subject to review in the court of appeals. To facilitate review, the paragraph provides that the court set forth its findings and conclusions as under Rule 52(a), though in most cases this explanation could be quite brief.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (D) explicitly authorizes the court to establish procedures facilitating the efficient and fair resolution of fee claims. A local rule, for example, might call for matters to be presented through affidavits, or might provide for issuance of proposed findings by the court, which would be treated as accepted by the parties unless objected to within a specified time. A court might also consider establishing a schedule reflecting customary fees or factors affecting fees within the community, as implicitly suggested by Justice O'Connor in <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens&rsquo; Council</em>, 483 U.S. 711, 733 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (how particular markets compensate for contingency). <em>Cf. Thompson v. Kennickell</em>, 710 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1989) (use of findings in other cases to promote consistency). The parties, of course, should be permitted to show that in the circumstances of the case such a schedule should not be applied or that different hourly rates would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule also explicitly permits, without need for a local rule, the court to refer issues regarding the amount of a fee award in a particular case to a master under Rule 53. The district judge may designate a magistrate judge to act as a master for this purpose or may refer a motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees to a magistrate judge for proposed findings and recommendations under Rule <!-- PDFPage:193 -->72(b). This authorization eliminates any controversy as to whether such references are permitted under Rule 53(b) as &ldquo;matters of account and of difficult computation of damages&rdquo; and whether motions for attorneys&rsquo; fees can be treated as the equivalent of a dispositive pretrial matter that can be referred to a magistrate judge. For consistency and efficiency, all such matters might be referred to the same magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (E) excludes from this rule the award of fees as sanctions under these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>
