<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The original is not required, and other evidence of the contents of a writing, recording, or photograph is admissible if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Originals Lost or Destroyed.</em> All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Original Not Obtainable.</em> No original can be obtained by any available judicial process or procedure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Original in Possession of Opponent.</em> At a time when an original was under the control of the party against whom offered, that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, and that party does not produce the original at the hearing; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Collateral Matters.</em> The writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">Basically the rule requiring the production of the original as proof of contents has developed as a rule of preference: if failure to produce the original is satisfactory explained, secondary evidence is admissible. The instant rule specifies the circumstances under which production of the original is excused.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule recognizes no &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; of secondary evidence. While strict logic might call for extending the principle of preference beyond simply preferring the original, the formulation of a hierarchy of preferences and a procedure for making it effective is believed to involve unwarranted complexities. Most, if not all, that would be accomplished by an extended scheme of preferences will, in any event, be achieved through the normal motivation of a party to present the most convincing evidence possible and the arguments and procedures available to his opponent if he does not. Compare McCormick &sect;207.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. Loss or destruction of the original, unless due to bad faith of the proponent, is a satisfactory explanation of nonproduction. McCormick &sect;201.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em>. When the original is in the possession of a third person, inability to procure it from him by resort to process or other judicial procedure is sufficient explanation of nonproduction. Judicial procedure includes subpoena duces tecum as an incident to the taking of a deposition in another jurisdiction. No further showing is required. See McCormick &sect;202.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3)</em>. A party who has an original in his control has no need for the protection of the rule if put on notice that proof of contents will be made. He can ward off secondary evidence by offering the original. The notice procedure here provided is not to be confused with <!-- PDFPage:394 -->orders to produce or other discovery procedures, as the purpose of the procedure under this rule is to afford the opposite party an opportunity to produce the original, not to compel him to do so. McCormick &sect;203.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em>. While difficult to define with precision, situations arise in which no good purpose is served by production of the original. Examples are the newspaper in an action for the price of publishing defendant's advertisement, <em>Foster-Holcomb Investment Co. v. Little Rock Publishing Co</em>., 151 Ark. 449, 236 S.W. 597 (1922), and the streetcar transfer of plaintiff claiming status as a passenger, <em>Chicago City Ry. Co. v. Carroll</em>, 206 Ill. 318, 68 N.E. 1087 (1903). Numerous cases are collected in McCormick &sect;200, p. 412, n. 1.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved Rule 1004(1) in the form submitted to Congress. However, the Committee intends that loss or destruction of an original by another person at the instigation of the proponent should be considered as tantamount to loss or destruction in bad faith by the proponent himself.</p>
