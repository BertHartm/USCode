<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in criminal proceedings by section 3500 of title 18, United States Code, if a witness uses a writing to refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) while testifying, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) before testifying, if the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-<!-- PDFPage:325 -->examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">The treatment of writings used to refresh recollection while on the stand is in accord with settled doctrine. McCormick &sect;9, p. 15. The bulk of the case law has, however, denied the existence of any right to access by the opponent when the writing is used prior to taking the stand, though the judge may have discretion in the matter. <em>Goldman v. United States</em>, 316 U.S. 129, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322 (1942); <em>Needelman v. United States</em>, 261 F.2d 802 (5th Cir. 1958), cert. dismissed 362 U.S. 600, 80 S.Ct. 960, 4 L.Ed.2d 980, rehearing denied 363 U.S. 858, 80 S.Ct. 1606, 4 L.Ed.2d 1739, Annot., 82 A.L.R.2d 473, 562 and 7 A.L.R.3d 181, 247. An increasing group of cases has repudiated the distinction, <em>People v. Scott</em>, 29 Ill.2d 97, 193 N.E.2d 814 (1963); <em>State v. Mucci</em>, 25 N.J. 423, 136 A.2d 761 (1957); <em>State v. Hunt</em>, 25 N.J. 514, 138 A.2d 1 (1958); <em>State v. Desolvers</em>, 40 R.I. 89, 100, A. 64 (1917), and this position is believed to be correct. As Wigmore put it, &ldquo;the risk of imposition and the need of safeguard is just as great&rdquo; in both situations. 3 Wigmore &sect;762, p. 111. To the same effect is McCormick &sect;9, p. 17.</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the phrase &ldquo;for the purpose of testifying&rdquo; is to safeguard against using the rule as a pretext for wholesale exploration of an opposing party's files and to insure that access is limited only to those writings which may fairly be said in fact to have an impact upon the testimony of the witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the rule is the same as that of the <em>Jencks</em> statute, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500: to promote the search of credibility and memory. The same sensitivity to disclosure of government files may be involved; hence the rule is expressly made subject to the statute, subdivision (a) of which provides: &ldquo;In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) shall be the subject of a subpena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.&rdquo; Items falling within the purview of the statute are producible only as provided by its terms, <em>Palermo v. United States</em>, 360 U.S. 343, 351 (1959), and disclosure under the rule is limited similarly by the statutory conditions. With this limitation in mind, some differences of application may be noted. The <em>Jencks</em> statute applies only to statements of witnesses; the rule is not so limited. The statute applies only to criminal cases; the rule applies to all cases. The statute applies only to government witnesses; the rule applies to all witnesses. The statute contains no requirement that the statement be consulted for purposes of refreshment before or while testifying; the rule so requires. Since many writings would qualify under either statute or rule, a substantial overlap exists, but the identity of procedures makes this of no importance.</p>
<p class="note-body">The consequences of nonproduction by the government in a criminal case are those of the <em>Jencks</em> statute, striking the testimony or in exceptional cases a mistrial. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500(d). In other cases these alternatives are unduly limited, and such possibilities as contempt, dismissal, finding issues against the offender, and the like are available. See Rule 16(g) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 37(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for appropriate sanctions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">As submitted to Congress, Rule 612 provided that except as set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3500, if a witness uses a writing to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying, &ldquo;either before or while testifying,&rdquo; an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness on it, and to introduce in evidence those portions relating to the witness&rsquo; testimony. The Committee amended the Rule so as still to require the production of writings used by a witness while testifying, but to render the production of writings used by a witness to refresh his memory before testifying discretionary with the court in the interests of justice, as is the case under existing federal law. See <em>Goldman v. United States</em>, 316 U.S. 129 (1942). The Committee considered that permitting an adverse party to require the production of writings used before testifying could result in fishing expeditions among a multitude of papers which a witness may have used in preparing for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee intends that nothing in the Rule be construed as barring the assertion of a privilege with respect to writings used by a witness to refresh his memory.</p>
