<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> states the law as generally accepted today. Rulings on evidence cannot be assigned as error unless (1) a substantial right is affected, and (2) the nature of the error was called to the attention of the judge, so as to alert him to the proper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take proper corrective measures. The objection and the offer of proof are the techniques for accomplishing these objectives. For similar provisions see Uniform Rules 4 and 5; California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;353 and 354; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;&sect;60&ndash;404 and 60&ndash;405. The rule does not purport to change the law with respect to harmless error. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2111, F.R.Civ.P. 61, F.R.Crim.P. 52, and decisions construing them. The status of constitutional error as harmless or not is treated in <em>Chapman v. California</em>, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), reh. denied <em>id</em>. 987, 87 S.Ct. 1283, 18 L.Ed.2d 241.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The first sentence is the third sentence of Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure virtually verbatim. Its purpose is to reproduce for an appellate court, insofar as possible, a true reflection of what occurred in the trial court. The second sentence is in part derived from the final sentence of Rule 43(c). It is designed to resolve doubts as to what testimony the witness would have in fact given, and, in nonjury cases, to provide the appellate court with material for a possible final disposition of the case in the event of reversal of a ruling which excluded evidence. See 5 Moore's Federal Practice &sect;43.11 (2d ed. 1968). Application is made discretionary in view of the practical impossibility of formulating a satisfactory rule in mandatory terms.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This subdivision proceeds on the supposition that a ruling which excludes evidence in a jury case is likely to be a pointless procedure if the excluded evidence nevertheless comes to the attention of the jury. <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, L.Ed.2d 70 (1968). Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: &ldquo;The court may require the offer to be made out of the hearing of the jury.&rdquo; <em>In re McCon<!-- PDFPage:352 -->nell</em>, 370 U.S. 230, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 8 L.Ed.2d 434 (1962), left some doubt whether questions on which an offer is based must first be asked in the presence of the jury. The subdivision answers in the negative. The judge can foreclose a particular line of testimony and counsel can protect his record without a series of questions before the jury, designed at best to waste time and at worst &ldquo;to waft into the jury box&rdquo; the very matter sought to be excluded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This wording of the plain error principle is from Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. While judicial unwillingness to be constructed by mechanical breakdowns of the adversary system has been more pronounced in criminal cases, there is no scarcity of decisions to the same effect in civil cases. In general, see Campbell, Extent to Which Courts of Review Will Consider Questions Not Properly Raised and Preserved, 7 Wis.L.Rev. 91, 160 (1932); Vestal, Sua Sponte Consideration in Appellate Review, 27 Fordham L.Rev. 477 (1958&ndash;59); 64 Harv.L.Rev. 652 (1951). In the nature of things the application of the plain error rule will be more likely with respect to the admission of evidence than to exclusion, since failure to comply with normal requirements of offers of proof is likely to produce a record which simply does not disclose the error.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment applies to all rulings on evidence whether they occur at or before trial, including so-called &ldquo;<em>in limine</em>&rdquo; rulings. One of the most difficult questions arising from <em>in limine</em> and other evidentiary rulings is whether a losing party must renew an objection or offer of proof when the evidence is or would be offered at trial, in order to preserve a claim of error on appeal. Courts have taken differing approaches to this question. Some courts have held that a renewal at the time the evidence is to be offered at trial is always required. <em>See, e.g., Collins v. Wayne Corp</em>., 621 F.2d 777 (5th Cir. 1980). Some courts have taken a more flexible approach, holding that renewal is not required if the issue decided is one that (1) was fairly presented to the trial court for an initial ruling, (2) may be decided as a final matter before the evidence is actually offered, and (3) was ruled on definitively by the trial judge. <em>See, e.g., Rosenfeld v. Basquiat</em>, 78 F.3d 84 (2d Cir. 1996) (admissibility of former testimony under the Dead Man's Statute; renewal not required). Other courts have distinguished between objections to evidence, which must be renewed when evidence is offered, and offers of proof, which need not be renewed after a definitive determination is made that the evidence is inadmissible. <em>See, e.g., Fusco v. General Motors Corp</em>., 11 F.3d 259 (1st Cir. 1993). Another court, aware of this Committee's proposed amendment, has adopted its approach. <em>Wilson v. Williams</em>, 182 F.3d 562 (7th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Differing views on this question create uncertainty for litigants and unnecessary work for the appellate courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that a claim of error with respect to a definitive ruling is preserved for review when the party has otherwise satisfied the objection or offer of proof requirements of Rule 103(a). When the ruling is definitive, a renewed objection or offer of proof at the time the evidence is to be offered is more a formalism than a necessity. <em>See</em> Fed.R.Civ.P. 46 (formal exceptions unnecessary); Fed.R.Cr.P.51 (same); <em>United States v. Mejia-Alarcon</em>, 995 F.2d 982, 986 (10th Cir. 1993) (&ldquo;Requiring a party to review an objection when the district court has issued a definitive ruling on a matter that can be fairly decided before trial would be in the nature of a formal exception and therefore unnecessary.&rdquo;). On the other hand, when the trial court appears to have reserved its ruling or to have indicated that the ruling is provisional, it makes sense to require the party to bring the issue to the court's attention subsequently. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vest</em>, 116 F.3d 1179, 1188 (7th Cir. 1997) (where the trial court ruled <em>in limine</em> that testimony from defense witnesses could not be admitted, but allowed the defendant to seek leave at trial to call the witnesses should their testimony turn out to be relevant, the defendant's failure to seek such leave at trial meant that it was &ldquo;too late to reopen the issue now on appeal&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Valenti</em>, 60 F.3d 941 (2d Cir. 1995) (failure to proffer evidence at trial waives any claim of error where the trial judge had stated that he would reserve judgment on the <em>in limine</em> motion until he had heard the trial evidence).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment imposes the obligation on counsel to clarify whether an <em>in limine</em> or other evidentiary ruling is definitive when there is doubt on that point. <em>See, e.g., Walden v. Georgia-Pacific Corp</em>., 126 F.3d 506, 520 (3d Cir. 1997) (although &ldquo;the district court told plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel not to reargue every ruling, it did not countermand its clear opening statement that all of its rulings were tentative, and counsel never requested clarification, as he might have done.&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Even where the court's ruling is definitive, nothing in the amendment prohibits the court from revisiting its decision when the evidence is to be offered. If the court changes its initial ruling, or if the opposing party violates the terms of the initial ruling, objection must be made when the evidence is offered to preserve the claim of error for appeal. The error, if any, in such a situation occurs only when the evidence is offered and admitted. <em>United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Olympia Wings, Inc</em>., 896 F.2d 949, 956 (5th Cir. 1990) (&ldquo;objection is required to preserve error when an opponent, or the court itself, violates a motion <em>in limine</em> that was granted&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Roenigk</em>, 810 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1987) (claim of error was not preserved where the defendant failed to object at trial to secure the benefit of a favorable advance ruling).</p>
<p class="note-body">A definitive advance ruling is reviewed in light of the facts and circumstances before the trial court at the time of the ruling. If the relevant facts and circumstances change materially after the advance ruling has been made, those facts and circumstances cannot be relied upon on appeal unless they have been brought to the attention of the trial court by way of a renewed, and timely, objection, offer of proof, or motion to strike. <em>See Old Chief v. United States</em>, 519 U.S. 172, 182, n.6 (1997) (&ldquo;It is important that a reviewing court evaluate the trial court's decision from its perspective when it had to rule and not indulge in review by hindsight.&rdquo;). Similarly, if the court decides in an advance ruling that proffered evidence is admissible subject to the eventual introduction by the proponent of a foundation for the evidence, and that foundation is never provided, the opponent cannot claim error based on the failure to establish the foundation unless the opponent calls that failure to the court's attention by a timely motion to strike or other suitable motion. <em>See Huddleston v. United States</em>, 485 U.S. 681, 690, n.7 (1988) (&ldquo;It is, of course, not the responsibility of the judge <em>sua sponte</em> to ensure that the foundation evidence is offered; the objector must move to strike the evidence if at the close of the trial the offeror has failed to satisfy the condition.&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) or 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1) pertaining to nondispositive pretrial rulings by magistrate judges in proceedings that are not before a magistrate judge by consent of the parties. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) provides that a party who fails to file a written objection to a magistrate judge's nondispositive order within ten days of receiving a copy &ldquo;may not thereafter assign as error a defect&rdquo; in the order. 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1) provides that any party &ldquo;may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court&rdquo; within ten days of receiving a copy of the order. Several courts have held that a party must comply with this statutory provision in order to preserve a claim of error. <em>See, e.g., Wells v. Shriners Hospital</em>, 109 F.3d 198, 200 (4th Cir. 1997) (&ldquo;[i]n this circuit, as in others, a party &lsquo;may&rsquo; file objections within ten days or he may not, as he chooses, but he &lsquo;shall&rsquo; do so if he wishes further consideration.&rdquo;). When Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) or 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1) is operative, its requirement must be satisfied in order for a party to preserve a claim of error on appeal, even where <!-- PDFPage:353 -->Evidence Rule 103(a) would not require a subsequent objection or offer of proof.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the rule set forth in <em>Luce v. United States</em>, 469 U.S. 38 (1984), and its progeny. The amendment provides that an objection or offer of proof need not be renewed to preserve a claim of error with respect to a definitive pretrial ruling. <em>Luce</em> answers affirmatively a separate question: whether a criminal defendant must testify at trial in order to preserve a claim of error predicated upon a trial court's decision to admit the defendant's prior convictions for impeachment. The <em>Luce</em> principle has been extended by many lower courts to other situations. <em>See United States v. DiMatteo</em>, 759 F.2d 831 (11th Cir. 1985) (applying <em>Luce</em> where the defendant's witness would be impeached with evidence offered under Rule 608). <em>See also United States v. Goldman</em>, 41 F.3d 785, 788 (1st Cir. 1994) (&ldquo;Although <em>Luce</em> involved impeachment by conviction under Rule 609, the reasons given by the Supreme Court for requiring the defendant to testify apply with full force to the kind of Rule 403 and 404 objections that are advanced by Goldman in this case.&rdquo;); <em>Palmieri v. DeFaria</em>, 88 F.3d 136 (2d Cir. 1996) (where the plaintiff decided to take an adverse judgment rather than challenge an advance ruling by putting on evidence at trial, the <em>in limine</em> ruling would not be reviewed on appeal); <em>United States v. Ortiz</em>, 857 F.2d 900 (2d Cir. 1988) (where uncharged misconduct is ruled admissible if the defendant pursues a certain defense, the defendant must actually pursue that defense at trial in order to preserve a claim of error on appeal); <em>United States v. Bond</em>, 87 F.3d 695 (5th Cir. 1996) (where the trial court rules <em>in limine</em> that the defendant would waive his fifth amendment privilege were he to testify, the defendant must take the stand and testify in order to challenge that ruling on appeal).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment does not purport to answer whether a party who objects to evidence that the court finds admissible in a definitive ruling, and who then offers the evidence to &ldquo;remove the sting&rdquo; of its anticipated prejudicial effect, thereby waives the right to appeal the trial court's ruling. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fisher</em>, 106 F.3d 622 (5th Cir. 1997) (where the trial judge ruled <em>in limine</em> that the government could use a prior conviction to impeach the defendant if he testified, the defendant did not waive his right to appeal by introducing the conviction on direct examination); <em>Judd v. Rodman</em>, 105 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 1997) (an objection made <em>in limine</em> is sufficient to preserve a claim of error when the movant, as a matter of trial strategy, presents the objectionable evidence herself on direct examination to minimize its prejudicial effect); <em>Gill v. Thomas</em>, 83 F.3d 537, 540 (1st Cir. 1996) (&ldquo;by offering the misdemeanor evidence himself, Gill waived his opportunity to object and thus did not preserve the issue for appeal&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Williams</em>, 939 F.2d 721 (9th Cir. 1991) (objection to impeachment evidence was waived where the defendant was impeached on direct examination).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report&mdash;Proposed Amendment to Rule 103(a)</em>. The Committee made the following changes to the published draft of the proposed amendment to Evidence Rule 103(a):</p>
<p class="note-body">1. A minor stylistic change was made in the text, in accordance with the suggestion of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The second sentence of the amended portion of the published draft was deleted, and the Committee Note was amended to reflect the fact that nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the rule of <em>Luce v. United States.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">3. The Committee Note was updated to include cases decided after the proposed amendment was issued for public comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The Committee Note was amended to include a reference to a Civil Rule and a statute requiring objections to certain Magistrate Judge rulings to be made to the District Court.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. The Committee Note was revised to clarify that an advance ruling does not encompass subsequent developments at trial that might be the subject of an appeal.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2011 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 103 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.</p>
