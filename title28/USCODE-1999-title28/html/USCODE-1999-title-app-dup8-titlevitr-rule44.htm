<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Authentication. (1) <em>Domestic.</em></strong> An official record kept within the United States, or any State, district, or commonwealth, or within a territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or by such officer's deputy, and accompanied by a certificate that such officer has the custody. The certificate may be made by a judge of a court of record of the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the court, or may be made by any public officer having a seal of office and having official duties in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of such officer's office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Foreign.</em></strong> A foreign official record, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced as provided in any treaty or federal statute or by an official publication thereof or a copy thereof, attested by a person authorized to make the attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to the genuineness of the signature and official position (A) of the attesting person or (B) of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official position relates to the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position relating to the attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of the documents, the court may, for good cause shown, (A) admit an attested copy without final certification or (B) permit the foreign official record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification. The final certification is unnecessary if the record and the attestation are certified as provided in a treaty or convention to which the United States and the foreign country in which the official record is located are parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Lack of Record.</strong> A written statement that after diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records designated by the statement, authenticated as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this rule in the case of a domestic record or complying with the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) of this rule for a summary in the case of a foreign record, is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Other Proof.</strong> This rule does not prevent the proof of official records or of entry or lack of entry therein by any other method authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Proof of Rules and Regulations.</strong> In a trial, or in making or opposing a motion, a party relying on a rule or regulation shall submit the full authentic text thereof for inclusion in the record, unless it is published in the Federal Register or in the Code of Federal Regulations. A rule or regulation so furnished need not be certified. The court may require the appropriate party to furnish the full authentic texts of additional rules or regulations not published in the Federal Register or in the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
