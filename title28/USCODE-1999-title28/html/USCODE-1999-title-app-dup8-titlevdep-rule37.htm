<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Motion for Order Compelling Discovery.</strong> A party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby, may apply for an order compelling discovery as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1) <em>Appropriate Court.</em></strong> [Not Used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Motion.</em></strong> If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or submitted under Rule 30 or 31, or a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a), or a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33, or if a party, in response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, fails to respond that inspection will be permitted as requested or fails to permit inspection as requested, the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer, or a designation, or an order compelling inspection in accordance with the request. See Appendix G &nbsp;8. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the examination before the proponent applies for an order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the court denies the motion in whole or in part, it may make such protective order as it would have been empowered to make on a motion made pursuant to Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>Evasive or Incomplete Answer.</em></strong> For purposes of subdivision (a) of this rule, an evasive or incomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4) <em>Award of Expenses of Motion.</em></strong> If the motion is granted, the court shall, after opportunity for hearing, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion or the party or attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, unless the court finds that the <!-- PDFPage:395 -->opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the motion is denied, the court shall, after opportunity for hearing, require the moving party or the attorney advising the motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure To Comply with Order. (1) <em>Sanctions Against a Deponent.</em></strong> If a deponent fails to be sworn or to answer a question after being directed to do so by the court, the failure may be considered a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Sanctions Against a Party.</em></strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of this rule or Rule 35, or if a party fails to obey an order entered under Rule 26(f), the court may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just and among others the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(A)</strong> An order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting such party from introducing designated matters in evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings unless the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(D)</strong> In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, an order treating as a contempt of court the failure to obey any orders except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(E)</strong> Where a party has failed to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring the party to produce another for examination, such orders as are listed in paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of subdivision (b) of this rule, unless the party failing to comply shows that the party is unable to produce such person for examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising such party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Expenses on Failure To Admit.</strong> If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested under Rule 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, such party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay such party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that <strong>(1)</strong> the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 36(a), or <strong>(2)</strong> the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or <strong>(3)</strong> the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, or <strong>(4)</strong> there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Failure of Party To Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers to Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection.</strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails (1) to appear before the officer who is to take the deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or (2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted under Rule 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the request, the court on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. In lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to act or the attorney advising such party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has applied for a protective order as provided by Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Subpoena of Person in Foreign Country.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Expenses Against United States.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Failure To Participate in the Framing of a Discovery Plan.</strong> If a party or a party's attorney fails to participate in good faith in the framing of a discovery plan by agreement as is required by Rule 26(f), the court may, after opportunity for hearing, require such party or such party's attorney to pay to any other party the reasonable expenses, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, caused by the failure.</p>
