<h3 class="analysis-subhead">PROCEDURE IN CONGRESSIONAL REFERENCE CASES</h3>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">(28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1492, 2509)</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>1. Purpose.</strong> The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, amended 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1492 and 2509, to authorize either House of Congress to refer bills to the chief judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims for investigation and report to the appropriate House. Procedures promulgated by the chief judge applicable to such congressional reference cases are specified herein. The RCFC, to the extent feasible, are to be applied in congressional reference cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>2. Service of notice.</strong> Upon referral of a bill to the chief judge by either House of the Congress, the clerk shall docket the reference and serve a notice, as provided in Rule 5, on each person whose name and address is shown by the papers transmitted and who appears to have an interest in the subject matter of the reference. The notice shall set forth the filing of the reference and state that the person notified appears to have an interest therein and that such person shall have 90 days within which to file a complaint. The clerk shall forward a copy of each such notice to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3. Complaint.</strong> Any person served with notice who desires to assert a claim may do so by filing a complaint in accordance with RCFC 3(c), 8 and 9 (or a preliminary complaint under RCFC 27(a)) of the rules of the court, except that the complaint shall be captioned as provided in &nbsp;6.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>4. Failure of party to appear.</strong> If no interested person files a complaint within the time specified in the notice served by the clerk, the case may be reported upon the papers filed and upon such evidence, if any, as may be produced by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>5. Hearing officer; review panel.</strong> Upon the filing of a complaint, the chief judge by order will designate a judge of the court to serve as hearing officer and a panel of three judges to serve as a reviewing body. One of the review panel members will be designated by the chief judge as presiding officer of the panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>6. Captions.</strong> All pleadings, motions, and any other papers of the parties, and all subpoenas, orders and reports of a hearing officer and review panel, shall be captioned as follows:</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">CONGRESSIONAL REFERENCE</h3>

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</h3>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Congressional Reference No. &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</h3>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>7. Subpoenas.</strong> Each hearing officer and each review panel shall have authority to do and perform any acts which may be necessary or proper for the efficient performance of their duties, including the power of subpoena and the power to administer oaths and affirmations. Subpoenas requiring travel of more than 100 miles to place of trial must have attached thereto an order of approval by the hearing officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>8. Hearing officer report.</strong> The hearing officer shall conduct such proceedings and utilize such rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims as may be required to determine the facts, including facts relating to delay or laches, facts bearing upon the question whether the bar of any statute of limitation should be removed, or facts claimed to excuse the claimant for not having resorted to any established legal remedy. The hearing officer shall find the facts specially. The hearing officer's findings shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the hearing officer to judge the credibility of witnesses. The hearing officer shall append to the findings of fact conclusions sufficient to inform Congress whether the demand is a legal or equitable claim or a gratuity, and the amount, if any, legally or equitably due from the United States to the claimant. The report shall be filed with the clerk, and served by the clerk on the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>9. Acceptance or exceptions.</strong> Within 30 days after service of the report, each party shall file either (a) a notice of intention to except to the report or (b) a notice accepting the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>10. Review panel consideration and report.</strong> The findings and conclusions of the hearing officer, together with the record of the case, shall be considered by the review panel. When a party or parties have filed a notice of intention to except, the presiding officer by order shall establish a schedule for the parties to file briefs on exceptions to the hearing officer's findings and <!-- PDFPage:419 -->conclusions and requests for oral argument before the panel. The chief judge will entertain no appeals or requests for review of any rulings or actions by a hearing officer or a review panel. No case shall be returned to the hearing officer unless so ordered by the review panel. On the basis of the entire record, the panel, by majority vote, shall adopt or modify the findings or the conclusions of the hearing officer and shall file its report with the clerk, for service on the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>11. Rehearing.</strong> Within 10 days after service of the report of the review panel, any party may file a motion for rehearing to alter or amend the report. The motion shall state with particularity any contention of law or fact which the movant believes has been overlooked or misapprehended, and shall contain argument in support thereof. Oral argument in support of the motion shall not be permitted. No response to a motion for rehearing is required, but will be considered if filed within 10 days from the date the motion for rehearing is served. No time extension shall be allowed for filing such a response. If the motion for rehearing is granted, the review panel shall take such further action as in its discretion may be required by the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>12. Transmittal to Congress.</strong> When all proceedings are concluded, the report of the review panel shall be transmitted by the chief judge to the appropriate House of Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>13. Admission to practice.</strong> Any attorney representing a claimant in a congressional reference case may file and appear as attorney of record in the proceeding if such attorney is a member of the bar of the United States Court of Federal Claims or, if not, upon certification to the clerk that such attorney is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any state in the Union or the District of Columbia. Any claimant, except a corporation, in a congressional reference case may proceed pro se.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>14. Filing fees.</strong> Filing fees as set by RCFC 77(k) are required in congressional reference cases.</p>
