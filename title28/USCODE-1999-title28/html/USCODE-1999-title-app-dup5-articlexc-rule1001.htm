<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this article the following definitions are applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Writings and recordings.&mdash;&ldquo;Writings&rdquo; and &ldquo;recordings&rdquo; consist of letters, words, or numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or other form of data compilation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Photographs.&mdash;&ldquo;Photographs&rdquo; include still photographs, X-ray films, video tapes, and motion pictures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Original.&mdash;An &ldquo;original&rdquo; of a writing or recording is the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it. An &ldquo;original&rdquo; of a photograph includes the negative or any print therefrom. If data are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an &ldquo;original&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Duplicate.&mdash;A &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; is a counterpart produced by the same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by means of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, or by mechanical or electronic re-recording, or by chemical reproduction, or by other equivalent techniques which accurately reproduces the original.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">In an earlier day, when discovery and other related procedures were strictly limited, the misleading named &ldquo;best evidence rule&rdquo; afforded substantial guarantees against inaccuracies and fraud by its insistence upon production of original documents. The great enlargement of the scope of discovery and related procedures in recent times has measurably reduced the need for the rule. Nevertheless important areas of usefulness persist: discovery of documents outside the jurisdiction may require substantial outlay of time and money; the unanticipated document may not practically be discoverable; criminal cases have built-in limitations on discovery. Cleary and Strong, The Best Evidence Rule: An Evaluation in Context, 51 Iowa L.Rev. 825 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1</em>). Traditionally the rule requiring the original centered upon accumulations of data and expressions affecting legal relations set forth in words and figures. This meant that the rule was one essentially related to writings. Present day techniques have expanded methods of storing data, yet the essential form which the information ultimately assumes for usable purposes is words and figures. Hence the considerations underlying the rule dictate its expansion to include computers, photographic systems, and other modern developments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3</em>). In most instances, what is an original will be self-evident and further refinement will be unnecessary. However, in some instances particularized definition is required. A carbon copy of a contract executed in duplicate becomes an original, as does a sales ticket carbon copy given to a customer. While strictly speaking the original of a photograph might be thought to be only the negative, practicality and common usage require that any print from the negative be regarded as an original. Similarly, practicality and usage confer the status of original upon any computer printout. <em>Transport Indemnity Co. v. Seib</em>, 178 Neb. 253, 132 N.W.2d 871 (1965).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4</em>). The definition describes &ldquo;copies&rdquo; produced by methods possessing an accuracy which virtually eliminates the possibility of error. Copies thus produced are given the status of originals in large measure by Rule 1003, <em>infra</em>. Copies subsequently produced manually, whether handwritten or typed, are not within the definition. It should be noted that what is an original for some purposes may be a duplicate for others. Thus a bank's microfilm record of checks cleared is the original as a record. However, a print offered as a copy of a check whose contents are in controversy is a duplicate. This result is substantially consistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1732(b). Compare 26 U.S.C. &sect;7513(c), giving full status as originals to photographic reproductions of tax returns and other documents, <!-- PDFPage:345 -->made by authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, and 44 U.S.C. &sect;399(a), giving original status to photographic copies in the National Archives.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Committee amended this Rule expressly to include &ldquo;video tapes&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;photographs.&rdquo;</p>
