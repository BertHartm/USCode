<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. An application addressed to an individual Justice shall be filed with the Clerk, who will transmit it promptly to the Justice concerned if an individual Justice has authority to grant the sought relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. The original and two copies of any application addressed to an individual Justice shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.2, and shall be accompanied by proof of service as required by Rule 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. An application shall be addressed to the Justice allotted to the Circuit from which the case arises. When the Circuit Justice is unavailable for any reason, the application addressed to that Justice will be distributed to the Justice then available who is next junior to the Circuit Justice; the turn of the Chief Justice follows that of the most junior Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. A Justice denying an application will note the denial thereon. Thereafter, unless action thereon is restricted by law to the Circuit Justice or is untimely under Rule 30.2, the party making an application, except in the case of an application for an extension of time, may renew it to any other Justice, subject to the provisions of this Rule. Except when the denial is without prejudice, a renewed application is not favored. Renewed application is made by a letter to the Clerk, designating the Justice to whom the application is to be directed, and accompanied by 10 copies of the original application and proof of service as required by Rule 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. A Justice to whom an application for a stay or for bail is submitted may refer it to the Court for determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. The Clerk will advise all parties concerned, by appropriately speedy means, of the disposition made of an application.</p>
