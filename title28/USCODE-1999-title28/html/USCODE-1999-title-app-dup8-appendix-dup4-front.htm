Service of an order to show cause instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding shall be made by personal service or by registered or certified mail addressed to the respondent-attorney at such attorney's last known address. If service by registered or certified mail is ineffective, the court shall enter an order as appropriate to effect service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>B</strong>. Service of any other papers or notices required by this Appendix shall be deemed to have been made if such paper or notice is addressed to the respondent-attorney at such attorney's last known address or the respondent-attorney at the address indicated in the most recent pleading or other document filed in the course of any proceeding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The court shall appoint as counsel one or more members of the bar of the court to investigate allegations of misconduct or to prosecute disciplinary proceedings under this Appendix, provided, however, that the respondent-attorney may move to disqualify an attorney so appointed who is or has been engaged as an adversary of the respondent-attorney in any matter. Counsel, once appointed, may not resign unless permission to do so is given by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">Rule X. Payment of Fees and Costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the conclusion of any disciplinary investigation or prosecution, if any, under this Appendix, counsel may make application to the court for an order awarding reasonable fees and reimbursing costs expended in the course of such disciplinary investigation or prosecution.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>A</strong>. Upon being informed that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been convicted of any crime, the clerk shall determine whether the clerk in which such conviction occurred has forwarded a certificate of such conviction to the court. If a certificate has not been so forwarded, the clerk shall promptly obtain a certificate and file it with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>B</strong>. Upon being informed that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been subjected to discipline by another court, the clerk shall determine whether a certified copy of the disciplinary judgment or order has been filed with the court, and, if not, the clerk shall promptly obtain a certified copy of the disciplinary judgment or order and file it with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>C</strong>. Whenever it appears that any person disbarred or suspended or censured or disbarred on consent by the court is admitted to practice law in any other jurisdiction or before any other court, the clerk shall, within 10 days of that disbarment, suspension, censure, or disbarment on consent, transmit to the disciplinary authority in such other jurisdiction, or for such other court, a certified copy of the judgment or order of disbarment, suspension, censure, or disbarment on consent, as well as the last known office and residence address of the defendant or respondent-attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>D</strong>. The clerk shall, likewise, notify the National Discipline Data Bank operated by the American Bar Association of any order imposing public discipline upon any attorney admitted to practice before the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>E</strong>. The clerk shall utilize a portion of the fee for admission required by RCFC 81(b)(4) to defray the payment of fees and costs under Rule X of this Appendix and any other costs incurred by the administration of this Appendix.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">Rule XII. Jurisdiction</h4>
