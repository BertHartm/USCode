<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Entry. When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as prescribed by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party's default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Judgment. Judgment by default may be entered as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In all cases the party entitled to a judgment by default shall apply to the court therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">When the plaintiff's claim against a defendant is for a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain, the court upon request of the plaintiff and upon affidavit of the amount due shall enter judgment for that amount against the defendant, if the defendant has been defaulted for failure to appear and is not an infant or incompetent person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action, the party (or, if appearing by representative, the party's representative) shall be served with 10-days written notice of the application for judgment. If, in order to enable the court to enter judgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of damages or to establish the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an investigation of any other matter, the court may conduct such hearings or order such references as it deems necessary and proper and shall accord a right of trial by jury to the parties when and as required by any statute of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Setting Aside Default. For good cause shown, the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside as prescribed by Rule 60(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Plaintiffs, Counterclaimants, Cross-Claimants. The provisions of this rule apply whether the party entitled to the judgment by default is a plaintiff, a third-party plaintiff, or a party who has pleaded a cross-claim or counterclaim. In all cases a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of Rule 54(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Judgment Against the United States. No judgment by default shall be entered against the <!-- PDFPage:480 -->United States or an officer or agency thereof unless the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.</p>
