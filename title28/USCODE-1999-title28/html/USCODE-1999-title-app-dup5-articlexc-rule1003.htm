<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.</p>

<p class="note-body">When the only concern is with getting the words or other contents before the court with accuracy and precision, then a counterpart serves equally as well as the original, if the counterpart is the product of a method which insures accuracy and genuineness. By definition in Rule 1001(4), <em>supra</em>, a &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; possesses this character.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, if no genuine issue exists as to authenticity and no other reason exists for requiring the original, a duplicate is admissible under the rule. This position finds support in the decisions, <em>Myrick v. United States</em>, 332 F.2d 279 (5th Cir. 1964), no error in admitting photostatic copies of checks instead of original microfilm in absence of suggestion to trial judge that photostats were incorrect; <em>Johns v. United States</em>, 323 F.2d 421 (5th Cir. 1963), not error to admit concededly accurate tape recording made from original wire recording; <em>Sauget v. Johnston</em>, 315 F.2d 816 (9th Cir. 1963), not error to admit copy of agreement when opponent had original and did not on appeal claim any discrepancy. Other reasons for requiring the original may be present when only a part of the original is reproduced and the remainder is needed for cross-examination or may disclose matters qualifying the part offered or otherwise useful to the opposing party. <em>United States v. Alexander</em>, 326 F.2d 736 (4th Cir. 1964). And see <em>Toho Bussan Kaisha, Ltd. v. American President Lines, Ltd</em>., 265 F.2d 418, 76 A.L.R.2d 1344 (2d Cir. 1959).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved this Rule in the form submitted by the Court, with the expectation that the courts would be liberal in deciding that a &ldquo;genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original.&rdquo;</p>
