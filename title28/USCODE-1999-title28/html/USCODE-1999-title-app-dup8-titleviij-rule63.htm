<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Inability.</strong> If a trial or hearing has been commenced and the judge is unable to proceed, any other judge may proceed with it upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the proceedings in the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties. The successor judge shall at the request of a party recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify against without undue burden. The successor judge may also recall any other witness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Voluntary Disqualification.</strong> A judge shall withdraw from a case when required by 28 U.S.C. &sect;455, and, at any time, may withdraw from a case if otherwise such judge deems such judge disqualified by bias or prejudice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Affidavit of Bias or Prejudice. (1)</strong> Whenever a party to any proceeding makes and files an affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against such party or in favor of any adverse party, such judge, if such judge determines that the affidavit is sufficient and timely, shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding. The ruling of the judge shall be by order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed as soon as practicable after the facts upon which the affidavit is based become known to the party, but not less than 10 days before a scheduled trial date, or good cause shall be shown for failure to file it within such time. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case. It shall be accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith.</p>
