<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Voluntary Dismissal; Effect Thereof. (1) <em>By Plaintiff; by Stipulation.</em></strong> Subject to the provisions of an order under Rule 23 and of any statute of the United States, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court <strong>(A)</strong> by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service of the answer or a response, whichever first occurs, or <strong>(B)</strong> by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in this court or in any court of the United States an action based on or including the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>By Order of Court.</em></strong> Except as provided in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by the United States prior to the service upon it of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Involuntary Dismissal; Effect Thereof.</strong> For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, the court may dismiss on its own motion or defendant may move for dismissal of an action or any claim. Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under subdivision (b) of this rule and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Dismissal of Counterclaim or Third-Party Claim.</strong> The provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim or third-party claim. A voluntary dismissal by the claimant alone pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this rule shall be made before a response is served or, if there is none, before the introduction of evidence at the trial or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Costs of Previously Dismissed Action.</strong> If a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action in any court commences an action based upon or including the same claim against the defendant, the court may make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it may deem proper and may stay the proceedings in the action until the plaintiff has complied with the order.</p>
