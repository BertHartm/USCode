<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Appeal in a Civil Case.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <strong>Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In a civil case, except as provided in Rules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <strong>Filing Before Entry of Judgment.</strong> A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision or order&mdash;but before the entry of the judgment or order&mdash;is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <strong>Multiple Appeals.</strong> If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period ends later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <strong>Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If a party timely files in the district court any of the following motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b);</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to amend or make additional factual findings under Rule 52(b), whether or not granting the motion would alter the judgment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for attorney's fees under Rule 54 if the district court extends the time to appeal under Rule 58;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is filed no later than 10 days (computed using Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)) after the judgment is entered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment&mdash;but before it disposes of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)&mdash;the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order, in whole or in part, when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A party intending to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment altered or amended upon such a motion, must file a notice of appeal, or an amended notice of appeal&mdash;in compliance with Rule 3(c)&mdash;within the time prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) No additional fee is required to file an amended notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <strong>Motion for Extension of Time.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that party shows excusable neglect or good cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be ex parte unless the court requires otherwise. If the motion is filed after the expiration of the prescribed time, notice must be given to the other parties in accordance with local rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 10 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <strong>Reopening the Time to File an Appeal.</strong> The district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if all the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, whichever is earlier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the court finds that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed but did not receive the notice from the district court or any party within 21 days after entry; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <strong>Entry Defined.</strong> A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(a) when it is entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Appeal in a Criminal Case.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <strong>Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after the later of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the filing of the government's notice of appeal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) When the government is entitled to appeal, its notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the later of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the entry of the judgment or order being appealed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <strong>Filing Before Entry of Judgment.</strong> A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order&mdash;but before the entry of the judgment or order&mdash;is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <strong>Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If a defendant timely makes any of the following motions under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the notice of appeal from a judgment of conviction must be filed within 10 days after the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion, or within 10 days after the entry of the judgment of conviction, whichever period ends later. This provision applies to a timely motion:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for a new trial under Rule 33, but if based on newly discovered evidence, only if the motion is made no later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for arrest of judgment under Rule 34.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order&mdash;but before it disposes of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A)&mdash;becomes effective upon the later of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the entry of the judgment of conviction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A valid notice of appeal is effective&mdash;without amendment&mdash;to appeal from an order disposing of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <strong>Motion for Extension of Time.</strong> Upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may&mdash;before or after the time has expired, with or without motion and notice&mdash;extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <strong>Jurisdiction.</strong> The filing of a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(b) does not divest a district court of jurisdiction to correct a sen<!-- PDFPage:9 -->tence under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c), nor does the filing of a motion under 35(c) affect the validity of a notice of appeal filed before entry of the order disposing of the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <strong>Entry Defined.</strong> A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Appeal by an Inmate Confined in an Institution.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil case under this Rule 4(c), the 14-day period provided in Rule 4(a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date when the district court dockets the first notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) When a defendant in a criminal case files a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(c), the 30-day period for the government to file its notice of appeal runs from the entry of the judgment or order appealed from or from the district court's docketing of the defendant's notice of appeal, whichever is later.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Mistaken Filing in the Court of Appeals.</strong> If a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case is mistakenly filed in the court of appeals, the clerk of that court must note on the notice the date when it was received and send it to the district clerk. The notice is then considered filed in the district court on the date so noted.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a</em>). This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a) without any change of substance. The requirement that a request for an extension of time for filing the notice of appeal made after expiration of the time be made by motion and on notice codifies the result reached under the present provisions of FRCP 73(a) and 6(b). <em>North Umberland Mining Co. v. Standard Accident Ins. Co</em>., 193 F.2d 951 (9th Cir., 1952); <em>Cohen v. Plateau Natural Gas Co</em>., 303 F.2d 273 (10th Cir., 1962); <em>Plant Economy, Inc. v. Mirror Insulation Co</em>., 308 F.2d 275 (3d Cir., 1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">Since this subdivision governs appeals in all civil cases, it supersedes the provisions of section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. &sect;48). Except in cases to which the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, the change is a minor one, since a successful litigant in a bankruptcy proceeding may, under section 25, oblige an aggrieved party to appeal within 30 days after entry of judgment&mdash;the time fixed by this subdivision in cases involving private parties only&mdash;by serving him with notice of entry on the day thereof, and by the terms of section 25 an aggrieved party must in any event appeal within 40 days after entry of judgment. No reason appears why the time for appeal in bankruptcy should not be the same as that in civil cases generally. Furthermore, section 25 is a potential trap for the uninitiated. The time for appeal which it provides is not applicable to all appeals which may fairly be termed appeals in bankruptcy. Section 25 governs only those cases referred to in section 24 as &ldquo;proceedings in bankruptcy&rdquo; and &ldquo;controversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy.&rdquo; <em>Lowenstein v. Reikes</em>, 54 F.2d 481 (2d Cir., 1931), <em>cert. den</em>., 285 U.S. 539, 52 S.Ct. 311, 76 L.Ed. 932 (1932). The distinction between such cases and other cases which arise out of bankruptcy is often difficult to determine. See 2 Moore's Collier on Bankruptcy &nbsp;24.12 through &nbsp;24.36 (1962). As a result it is not always clear whether an appeal is governed by section 25 or by FRCP 73(a), which is applicable to such appeals in bankruptcy as are not governed by section 25.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of the unification of the civil and admiralty procedure accomplished by the amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effective July 1, 1966, this subdivision governs appeals in those civil actions which involve admiralty or maritime claims and which prior to that date were known as suits in admiralty.</p>
<p class="note-body">The only other change possibly effected by this subdivision is in the time for appeal from a decision of a district court on a petition for impeachment of an award of a board of arbitration under the Act of May 20, 1926, c. 347, &sect;9 (44 Stat. 585), 45 U.S.C. &sect;159. The act provides that a notice of appeal from such a decision shall be filed within 10 days of the decision. This singular provision was apparently repealed by the enactment in 1948 of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2107, which fixed 30 days from the date of entry of judgment as the time for appeal in all actions of a civil nature except actions in admiralty or bankruptcy matters or those in which the United States is a party. But it was not expressly repealed, and its status is in doubt. See 7 Moore's Federal Practice &nbsp;73.09[2] (1966). The doubt should be resolved, and no reason appears why appeals in such cases should not be taken within the time provided for civil cases generally.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b). </em>This subdivision is derived from FRCrP 37(a)(2) without change of substance.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)</em>. The words &ldquo;(including a civil action which involves an admiralty or maritime claim and a proceeding in bankruptcy or a controversy arising therein),&rdquo; which appear in the present rule are struck out as unnecessary and perhaps misleading in suggesting that there may be other categories that are not either civil or criminal within the meaning of Rule 4(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrases &ldquo;within 30 days of such entry&rdquo; and &ldquo;within 60 days of such entry&rdquo; have been changed to read &ldquo;after&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or.&rdquo; The change is for clarity only, since the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; in the present rule appears to be used to mean &ldquo;after.&rdquo; Since the proposed amended rule deals directly with the premature filing of a notice of appeal, it was thought useful to emphasize the fact that except as provided, the period during which a notice of appeal may be filed is the 30 days, or 60 days as the case may be, following the entry of the judgment or order appealed from. See Notes to Rule 4(a)(2) and (4), below.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2</em>). The proposed amendment to Rule 4(a)(2) would extend to civil cases the provisions of Rule 4(b), dealing with criminal cases, designed to avoid the loss of the right to appeal by filing the notice of appeal prematurely. Despite the absence of such a provision in Rule 4(a) the courts of appeals quite generally have held premature appeals effective. See, e. g., <em>Matter of Grand Jury Empanelled Jan. 21, 1975</em>, 541 F.2d 373 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Hodge v. Hodge</em>, 507 F.2d 87 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Song Jook Suh v. Rosenberg</em>, 437 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Ruby v. Secretary of the Navy</em>, 365 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1966); <em>Firchau v. Diamond Nat'l Corp</em>., 345 F.2d 469 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:10 --><p class="note-body">The proposed amended rule would recognize this practice but make an exception in cases in which a post trial motion has destroyed the finality of the judgment. See Note to Rule 4(a)(4) below.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4</em>). The proposed amendment would make it clear that after the filing of the specified post trial motions, a notice of appeal should await disposition of the motion. Since the proposed amendments to Rules 3, 10, and 12 contemplate that immediately upon the filing of the notice of appeal the fees will be paid and the case docketed in the court of appeals, and the steps toward its disposition set in motion, it would be undesirable to proceed with the appeal while the district court has before it a motion the granting of which would vacate or alter the judgment appealed from. See, e. g., <em>Kieth v. Newcourt</em>, 530 F.2d 826 (8th Cir. 1976). Under the present rule, since docketing may not take place until the record is transmitted, premature filing is much less likely to involve waste effort. See, e. g., <em>Stokes v. Peyton's Inc</em>., 508 F.2d 1287 (5th Cir. 1975). Further, since a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a post trial motion, even if it were treated as valid for purposes of jurisdiction, would not embrace objections to the denial of the motion, it is obviously preferable to postpone the notice of appeal until after the motion is disposed of.</p>
<p class="note-body">The present rule, since it provides for the &ldquo;termination&rdquo; of the &ldquo;running&rdquo; of the appeal time, is ambiguous in its application to a notice of appeal filed prior to a post trial motion filed within the 10 day limit. The amendment would make it clear that in such circumstances the appellant should not proceed with the appeal during pendency of the motion but should file a new notice of appeal after the motion is disposed of.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5</em>). Under the present rule it is provided that upon a showing of excusable neglect the district court at any time may extend the time for the filing of a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by the rule, but that if the application is made after the original time has run, the order may be made only on motion with such notice as the court deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">A literal reading of this provision would require that the extension be ordered and the notice of appeal filed within the 30 day period, but despite the surface clarity of the rule, it has produced considerable confusion. See the discussion by Judge Friendly in <em>In re Orbitek</em>, 520 F.2d 358 (2d Cir. 1975). The proposed amendment would make it clear that a motion to extend the time must be filed no later than 30 days after the expiration of the original appeal time, and that if the motion is timely filed the district court may act upon the motion at a later date, and may extend the time not in excess of 10 days measured from the date on which the order granting the motion is entered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the present rule there is a possible implication that prior to the time the initial appeal time has run, the district court may extend the time on the basis of an informal application. The amendment would require that the application must be made by motion, though the motion may be made ex parte. After the expiration of the initial time a motion for the extension of the time must be made in compliance with the F.R.C.P. and local rules of the district court. See Note to proposed amended Rule 1, supra. And see Rules 6(d), 7(b) of the F.R.C.P.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amended rule expands to some extent the standard for the grant of an extension of time. The present rule requires a &ldquo;showing of excusable neglect.&rdquo; While this was an appropriate standard in cases in which the motion is made after the time for filing the notice of appeal has run, and remains so, it has never fit exactly the situation in which the appellant seeks an extension before the expiration of the initial time. In such a case &ldquo;good cause,&rdquo; which is the standard that is applied in the granting of other extensions of time under Rule 26(b) seems to be more appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6</em>). The proposed amendment would call attention to the requirement of Rule 58 of the F.R.C.P. that the judgment constitute a separate document. See <em>United States v. Indrelunas</em>, 411 U.S. 216 (1973). When a notice of appeal is filed, the clerk should ascertain whether any judgment designated therein has been entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) and if not, so advise all parties and the district judge. While the requirement of Rule 48 is not jurisdictional (see <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis</em>, 431 U.S. 928 (1977)), compliance is important since the time for the filing of a notice of appeal by other parties is measured by the time at which the judgment is properly entered.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides a limited opportunity for relief in circumstances where the notice of entry of a judgment or order, required to be mailed by the clerk of the district court pursuant to Rule 77(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is either not received by a party or is received so late as to impair the opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal. The amendment adds a new subdivision (6) allowing a district court to reopen for a brief period the time for appeal upon a finding that notice of entry of a judgment or order was not received from the clerk or a party within 21 days of its entry and that no party would be prejudiced. By &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; the Committee means some adverse consequence other than the cost of having to oppose the appeal and encounter the risk of reversal, consequences that are present in every appeal. Prejudice might arise, for example, if the appellee had taken some action in reliance on the expiration of the normal time period for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reopening may be ordered only upon a motion filed within 180 days of the entry of a judgment or order or within 7 days of receipt of notice of such entry, whichever is earlier. This provision establishes an outer time limit of 180 days for a party who fails to receive timely notice of entry of a judgment to seek additional time to appeal and enables any winning party to shorten the 180-day period by sending (and establishing proof of receipt of) its own notice of entry of a judgment, as authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 77(d). Winning parties are encouraged to send their own notice in order to lessen the chance that a judge will accept a claim of non-receipt in the face of evidence that notices were sent by both the clerk and the winning party. Receipt of a winning party's notice will shorten only the time for reopening the time for appeal under this subdivision, leaving the normal time periods for appeal unaffected.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the motion is granted, the district court may reopen the time for filing a notice of appeal only for a period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(1). The amendment is intended to alert readers to the fact that paragraph (a)(4) extends the time for filing an appeal when certain posttrial motions are filed. The Committee hopes that awareness of the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) will prevent the filing of a notice of appeal when a posttrial tolling motion is pending.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(2). The amendment treats a notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision or order, but before its formal entry, as if the notice had been filed after entry. The amendment deletes the language that made paragraph (a)(2) inapplicable to a notice of appeal filed after announcement of the disposition of a posttrial motion enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) but before the entry of the order, <em>see Acosta v. Louisiana Dep't of Health & Human Resources</em>, 478 U.S. 251 (1986) (per curiam); <em>Alerte v. McGinnis</em>, 898 F.2d 69 (7th Cir. 1990). Because the amendment of paragraph (a)(4) recognizes all notices of appeal filed after announcement or entry of judgment&mdash;even those that are filed while the posttrial motions enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) are pending&mdash;the amendment of this para<!-- PDFPage:11 -->graph is consistent with the amendment of paragraph (a)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(3). The amendment is technical in nature; no substantive change is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(4). The 1979 amendment of this paragraph created a trap for an unsuspecting litigant who files a notice of appeal before a posttrial motion, or while a posttrial motion is pending. The 1979 amendment requires a party to file a new notice of appeal after the motion's disposition. Unless a new notice is filed, the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co</em>., 459 U.S. 56 (1982). Many litigants, especially pro se litigants, fail to file the second notice of appeal, and several courts have expressed dissatisfaction with the rule. <em>See, e.g., Averhart v. Arrendondo</em>, 773 F.2d 919 (7th Cir. 1985); <em>Harcon Barge Co. v. D & G Boat Rentals, Inc</em>., 746 F.2d 278 (5th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied</em>, 479 U.S. 930 (1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a specified posttrial motion will become effective upon disposition of the motion. A notice filed before the filing of one of the specified motions or after the filing of a motion but before disposition of the motion is, in effect, suspended until the motion is disposed of, whereupon, the previously filed notice effectively places jurisdiction in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because a notice of appeal will ripen into an effective appeal upon disposition of a posttrial motion, in some instances there will be an appeal from a judgment that has been altered substantially because the motion was granted in whole or in part. Many such appeals will be dismissed for want of prosecution when the appellant fails to meet the briefing schedule. But, the appellee may also move to strike the appeal. When responding to such a motion, the appellant would have an opportunity to state that, even though some relief sought in a posttrial motion was granted, the appellant still plans to pursue the appeal. Because the appellant's response would provide the appellee with sufficient notice of the appellant's intentions, the Committee does not believe that an additional notice of appeal is needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a posttrial tolling motion is sufficient to bring the underlying case, as well as any orders specified in the original notice, to the court of appeals. If the judgment is altered upon disposition of a posttrial motion, however, and if a party wishes to appeal from the disposition of the motion, the party must amend the notice to so indicate. When a party files an amended notice, no additional fees are required because the notice is an amendment of the original and not a new notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (a)(4) is also amended to include, among motions that extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, a Rule 60 motion that is served within 10 days after entry of judgment. This eliminates the difficulty of determining whether a posttrial motion made within 10 days after entry of a judgment is a Rule 59(e) motion, which tolls the time for filing an appeal, or a Rule 60 motion, which historically has not tolled the time. The amendment comports with the practice in several circuits of treating all motions to alter or amend judgments that are made within 10 days after entry of judgment as Rule 59(e) motions for purposes of Rule 4(a)(4). <em>See, e.g., Finch v. City of Vernon</em>, 845 F.2d 256 (11th Cir. 1988); <em>Rados v. Celotex Corp</em>., 809 F.2d 170 (2d Cir. 1986); <em>Skagerberg v. Oklahoma</em>, 797 F.2d 881 (10th Cir. 1986). To conform to a recent Supreme Court decision, however&mdash;<em>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Co</em>., 486 U.S. 196 (1988)&mdash;the amendment excludes motions for attorney's fees from the class of motions that extend the filing time unless a district court, acting under Rule 58, enters an order extending the time for appeal. This amendment is to be read in conjunction with the amendment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (b). The amendment grammatically restructures the portion of this subdivision that lists the types of motions that toll the time for filing an appeal. This restructuring is intended to make the rule easier to read. No substantive change is intended other than to add a motion for judgment of acquittal under Criminal Rule 29 to the list of tolling motions. Such a motion is the equivalent of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which tolls the running of time for an appeal in a civil case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment also eliminates an ambiguity from the third sentence of this subdivision. Prior to this amendment, the third sentence provided that if one of the specified motions was filed, the time for filing an appeal would run from the entry of an order denying the motion. That sentence, like the parallel provision in Rule 4(a)(4), was intended to toll the running of time for appeal if one of the posttrial motions is timely filed. In a criminal case, however, the time for filing the motions runs not from entry of judgment (as it does in civil cases), but from the verdict or finding of guilt. Thus, in a criminal case, a posttrial motion may be disposed of more than 10 days before sentence is imposed, i.e. before the entry of judgment. <em>United States v. Hashagen</em>, 816 F.2d 899, 902 n.5 (3d Cir. 1987). To make it clear that a notice of appeal need not be filed before entry of judgment, the amendment states that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order disposing of the motion, or within 10 days after the entry of judgment, whichever is later. The amendment also changes the language in the third sentence providing that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order <em>denying</em> the motion; the amendment says instead that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order <em>disposing of the last such motion outstanding</em>. (Emphasis added) The change recognizes that there may be multiple posttrial motions filed and that, although one or more motions may be granted in whole or in part, a defendant may still wish to pursue an appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also states that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of any of the posttrial tolling motions becomes effective upon disposition of the motions. In most circuits this language simply restates the current practice. <em>See United States v. Cortes</em>, 895 F.2d 1245 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 495 U.S. 939 (1990). Two circuits, however, have questioned that practice in light of the language of the rule, <em>see United States v. Gargano</em>, 826 F.2d 610 (7th Cir. 1987), and <em>United States v. Jones</em>, 669 F.2d 559 (8th Cir. 1982), and the Committee wishes to clarify the rule. The amendment is consistent with the proposed amendment of Rule 4(a)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is further amended in light of new Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c), which authorizes a sentencing court to correct any arithmetical, technical, or other clear errors in sentencing within 7 days after imposing the sentence. The Committee believes that a sentencing court should be able to act under Criminal Rule 35(c) even if a notice of appeal has already been filed; and that a notice of appeal should not be affected by the filing of a Rule 35(c) motion or by correction of a sentence under Rule 35(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (c). In <em>Houston v. Lack</em>, 487 U.S. 266 (1988), the Supreme Court held that a <em>pro se</em> prisoner's notice of appeal is &ldquo;filed&rdquo; at the moment of delivery to prison authorities for forwarding to the district court. The amendment reflects that decision. The language of the amendment is similar to that in Supreme Court Rule 29.2.</p>
<p class="note-body">Permitting an inmate to file a notice of appeal by depositing it in an institutional mail system requires adjustment of the rules governing the filing of cross-appeals. In a civil case, the time for filing a cross-appeal ordinarily runs from the date when the first notice of appeal is filed. If an inmate's notice of appeal is filed by depositing it in an institution's mail system, it is possible that the notice of appeal will not arrive in the district court until several days after the &ldquo;filing&rdquo; date and perhaps even after the time for filing a cross-appeal has expired. To avoid that problem, subdivision (c) provides that in a civil case when an institutionalized person files a notice of appeal by depositing it in the in<!-- PDFPage:12 -->stitution's mail system, the time for filing a cross-appeal runs from the district court's receipt of the notice. The amendment makes a parallel change regarding the time for the government to appeal in a criminal case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 52, and 59 were previously inconsistent with respect to whether certain postjudgment motions had to be filed or merely served no later than 10 days after entry of judgment. As a consequence Rule 4(a)(4) spoke of making or serving such motions rather than filing them. Civil Rules 50, 52, and 59, are being revised to require filing before the end of the 10-day period. As a consequence, this rule is being amended to provide that &ldquo;filing&rdquo; must occur within the 10 day period in order to affect the finality of the judgment and extend the period for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Civil Rules require the filing of postjudgment motions &ldquo;no later than 10 days after entry of judgment&rdquo;&mdash;rather than &ldquo;within&rdquo; 10 days&mdash;to include postjudgment motions that are filed before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. This rule is amended, therefore, to use the same terminology.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is further amended to clarify the fact that a party who wants to obtain review of an alteration or amendment of a judgment must file a notice of appeal or amend a previously filed notice to indicate intent to appeal from the altered judgment.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; in this rule, however, substantive changes are made in paragraphs (a)(6) and (b)(4), and in subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (a), paragraph (1).</strong> Although the Advisory Committee does not intend to make any substantive changes in this paragraph, cross-references to Rules 4(a)(1)(B) and 4(c) have been added to subparagraph (a)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (a), paragraph (4).</strong> Item (vi) in subparagraph (A) of Rule 4(a)(4) provides that filing a motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 will extend the time for filing a notice of appeal if the Rule 60 motion is filed no later than 10 days after judgment is entered. Again, the Advisory Committee does not intend to make any substantive change in this paragraph. But because Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and Fed. R. App. P. 26(a) have different methods for computing time, one might be uncertain whether the 10-day period referred to in Rule 4(a)(4) is computed using Civil Rule 6(a) or Appellate Rule 26(a). Because the Rule 60 motion is filed in the district court, and because Fed. R. App. P. 1(a)(2) says that when the appellate rules provide for filing a motion in the district court, &ldquo;the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court,&rdquo; the rule provides that the 10-day period is computed using Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (a), paragraph (6).</strong> Paragraph (6) permits a district court to reopen the time for appeal if a party has not received notice of the entry of judgment and no party would be prejudiced by the reopening. Before reopening the time for appeal, the existing rule requires the district court to find that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of judgment and did not receive it &ldquo;from the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry.&rdquo; The Advisory Committee makes a substantive change. The finding must be that the movant did not receive notice &ldquo;from the district court or any party within 21 days after entry.&rdquo; This change broadens the type of notice that can preclude reopening the time for appeal. The existing rule provides that only notice from a party or from the clerk bars reopening. The new language precludes reopening if the movant has received notice from &ldquo;the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (b).</strong> Two substantive changes are made in what will be paragraph (b)(4). The current rule permits an extension of time to file a notice of appeal if there is a &ldquo;showing of excusable neglect.&rdquo; First, the rule is amended to permit a court to extend the time for &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; as well as for excusable neglect. Rule 4(a) permits extensions for both reasons in civil cases and the Advisory Committee believes that &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; should be sufficient in criminal cases as well. The amendment does not limit extensions for good cause to instances in which the motion for extension of time is filed before the original time has expired. The rule gives the district court discretion to grant extensions for good cause whenever the court believes it appropriate to do so provided that the extended period does not exceed 30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by Rule 4(b). Second, paragraph (b)(4) is amended to require only a &ldquo;finding&rdquo; of excusable neglect or good cause and not a &ldquo;showing&rdquo; of them. Because the rule authorizes the court to provide an extension without a motion, a &ldquo;showing&rdquo; is obviously not required; a &ldquo;finding&rdquo; is sufficient.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (c).</strong> Substantive amendments are made in this subdivision. The current rule provides that if an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal by depositing it in the institution's internal mail system, the notice is timely filed if deposited on or before the last day for filing. Some institutions have special internal mail systems for handling legal mail; such systems often record the date of deposit of mail by an inmate, the date of delivery of mail to an inmate, etc. The Advisory Committee amends the rule to require an inmate to use the system designed for legal mail, if there is one, in order to receive the benefit of this subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">When an inmate uses the filing method authorized by subdivision (c), the current rule provides that the time for other parties to appeal begins to run from the date the district court &ldquo;receives&rdquo; the inmate's notice of appeal. The rule is amended so that the time for other parties begins to run when the district court &ldquo;dockets&rdquo; the inmate's appeal. A court may &ldquo;receive&rdquo; a paper when its mail is delivered to it even if the mail is not processed for a day or two, making the date of receipt uncertain. &ldquo;Docketing&rdquo; is an easily identified event. The change eliminates uncertainty. Paragraph (c)(3) is further amended to make it clear that the time for the government to file its appeal runs from the later of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from or the district court's docketing of a defendant's notice filed under this paragraph (c).</p>
