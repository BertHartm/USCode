<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Death. (1)</strong> If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the successors or representatives of the deceased party, and shall be served as provided in Rule 5. Unless the motion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death as provided herein for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> In the event of the death of one or more of the plaintiffs in an action in which the right sought to be enforced survives only to the surviving plaintiffs, the action does not abate. The death shall be suggested upon the record and the action shall proceed in favor of or against the surviving parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Incompetency.</strong> If a party becomes incompetent, the court upon motion served as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule may allow the action to be continued by or against the party's representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Transfer of Interest.</strong> In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. Service of the motion shall be made as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Public Officers; Death or Separation from Office.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
