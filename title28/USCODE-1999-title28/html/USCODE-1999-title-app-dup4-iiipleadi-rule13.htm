<h3 class="section-head">Rule 13. Counterclaim and Cross-Claim</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compulsory Counterclaims</cap-smallcap>. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the pleader need not state the claim if (1) at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action, or (2) the opposing party brought suit upon the claim by attachment or other process by which the court did not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment on that claim, and the pleader is not stating any counterclaim under this Rule 13.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Permissive Counterclaims</cap-smallcap>. A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim</cap-smallcap>. A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Counterclaim Against the United States</cap-smallcap>. These rules shall not be construed to enlarge beyond the limits now fixed by law the right to assert counterclaims or to claim credits against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading</cap-smallcap>. A claim which either matured or was acquired by the pleader after serving a pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Omitted Counterclaim</cap-smallcap>. When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Cross-Claim Against Co-Party</cap-smallcap>. A pleading may state as a cross-claim any claim by one party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter either of the original action or of a counterclaim therein or relating to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. Such cross-claim may include a claim that the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Joinder of Additional Parties</cap-smallcap>. Persons other than those made parties to the original action may be made parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim in accordance with the provisions of Rules 19 and 20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Separate Trials; Separate Judgments</cap-smallcap>. If the court orders separate trials as provided in Rule 42(b), judgment on a counterclaim or cross-claim may be rendered in accordance with the terms of Rule 54(b) when the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party have been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. This is substantially [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), broadened to include legal as well as equitable counterclaims.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Compare the English practice, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 2 and 3, and O. 21, r.r. 10&mdash;17; <em>Beddall v. Maitland</em>, L.R. 17 Ch.Div. 174, 181, 182 (1881).</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Certain States have also adopted almost unrestricted provisions concerning both the subject matter of and the parties to a counterclaim. This seems to be the modern tendency. Ark.Civ.Code (Crawford, 1934) &sect;&sect;117 (as amended) and 118; N.J.Comp.Stat. (2 Cum.Supp. 1911&ndash;1924), N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;262, 266, 267 (all as amended, Laws of 1936, ch. 324), 268, 269, and 271; Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;263.14 (1)(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Most codes do not expressly provide for a counterclaim in the reply. Clark, <em>Code Pleading</em> (1928), p. 486. Ky.Codes (Carroll, 1932) Civ.Pract. &sect;98 does provide, however, for such counterclaim.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. The provisions of this rule respecting counterclaims are subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected). For a discussion of Federal jurisdiction and venue in regard to counterclaims and cross-claims, see Shulman and Jaegerman, <em>Some Jurisdictional Limitations in Federal Procedure</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 393, 410 et seq.</p>
<p class="note-body">6. This rule does not affect such statutes of the United States as U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;41(1) [now 1332, 1345, 1359] (United States as plaintiff; civil suits at common law and in equity), relating to assigned claims in actions based on diversity of citizenship.</p>
<p class="note-body">7. If the action proceeds to judgment without the interposition of a counterclaim as required by subdivision (a) of this rule, the counterclaim is barred. See <em>American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co</em>., 260 U.S. 360 (1922); <em>Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. National Electric Signalling Co</em>., 206 Fed. 295 (E.D.N.Y., 1913); Hopkins, <em>Federal Equity Rules</em> (8th ed., 1933), p. 213; Simkins, <em>Federal Practice</em> (1934), p. 663</p>
<p class="note-body">8. For allowance of credits against the United States see U.S.C., Title 26, &sect;&sect;1672&ndash;1673 [see 7442] (Suits for refunds of internal revenue taxes&mdash;limitations); U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;&sect;774 [now 2406] (Suits by United States against individuals; credits), [former] 775 (Suits under postal laws; credits); U.S.C., Title 31, &sect;227 [now 3728] (Offsets against judgments and claims against United States).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The use of the word &ldquo;filing&rdquo; was inadvertent. The word &ldquo;serving&rdquo; conforms with subdivision (<em>e</em>) and with usage generally throughout the rules.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:107 --><p class="note-body">The removal of the phrase &ldquo;not the subject of a pending action&rdquo; and the addition of the new clause at the end of the subdivision is designed to eliminate the ambiguity noted in <em>Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Saxe</em> (App.D.C. 1943) 134 F.(2d) 16, 33&ndash;34, cert. den. (1943) 319 U.S. 745. The rewording of the subdivision in this respect insures against an undesirable possibility presented under the original rule whereby a party having a claim which would be the subject of a compulsory counterclaim could avoid stating it as such by bringing an independent action in another court after the commencement of the federal action but before serving his pleading in the federal action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. The amendment is to care for a situation such as where a second mortgagee is made defendant in a foreclosure proceeding and wishes to file a cross-complaint against the mortgagor in order to secure a personal judgment for the indebtedness and foreclose his lien. A claim of this sort by the second mortgagee may not necessarily arise out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action under the terms of Rule 13(g).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em>. The change clarifies the interdependence of Rules 13(i) and 54(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">When a defendant, if he desires to defend his interest in property, is obliged to come in and litigate in a court to whose jurisdiction he could not ordinarily be subjected, fairness suggests that he should not be required to assert counterclaims, but should rather be permitted to do so at his election. If, however, he does elect to assert a counterclaim, it seems fair to require him to assert any other which is compulsory within the meaning of Rule 13(a). Clause (2), added by amendment to Rule 13(a), carries out this idea. It will apply to various cases described in Rule 4(e), as amended, where service is effected through attachment or other process by which the court does not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment against the defendant. Clause (2) will also apply to actions commenced in State courts jurisdictionally grounded on attachment or the like, and removed to the Federal courts.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 13(h), dealing with the joinder of additional parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim, has partaken of some of the textual difficulties of Rule 19 on necessary joinder of parties. See Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 19, as amended; cf. 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, Par. 13.39 (2d ed. 1963), and Supp. thereto; 1A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;399 (Wright ed. 1960). Rule 13(h) has also been inadequate in failing to call attention to the fact that a party pleading a counterclaim or cross-claim may join additional persons when the conditions for permissive joinder of parties under Rule 20 are satisfied.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of Rule 13(h) supplies the latter omission by expressly referring to Rule 20, as amended, and also incorporates by direct reference the revised criteria and procedures of Rule 19, as amended. Hereafter, for the purpose of determining who must or may be joined as additional parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim, the party pleading the claim is to be regarded as a plaintiff and the additional parties as plaintiffs or defendants as the case may be, and amended Rules 19 and 20 are to be applied in the usual fashion. See also Rules 13(a) (compulsory counterclaims) and 22 (interpleader).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of Rule 13(h), like the amendment of Rule 19, does not attempt to regulate Federal jurisdiction or venue. See Rule 82. It should be noted, however, that in some situations the decisional law has recognized &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; Federal jurisdiction over counterclaims and cross-claims and &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; venue as to parties to these claims.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
