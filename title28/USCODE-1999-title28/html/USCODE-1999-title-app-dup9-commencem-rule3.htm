<p class="statutory-body">(e) Amendment of Summons.

In an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c), the plaintiff, as provided in section 516A(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, shall notify every interested party who was a party to the administrative proceeding of the commencement of the action, by mailing a copy of the summons at the time the action is commenced, or promptly thereafter, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to each such party at the address last known in the administrative proceeding.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Practice Comment</h4>
<p class="note-body">For the appropriate summons form and number of copies to be filed, refer to Forms 1 to 4 of the Appendix of Forms. Information Statement forms, as shown in Form 5, are available upon request from the office of the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">As prescribed by Rule 5(e), a summons or a summons and complaint may be filed by delivery or by mailing. The filing is completed when received, except that when the method of mailing prescribed by Rule 5(g) is used, the summons or summons and complaint are deemed filed as of the date of mailing.</p>
<p class="note-body">To provide information to assist a judge in determining whether there is reason for disqualification upon the grounds of a financial interest, under 28 U.S.C. &sect;455, a completed &ldquo;Disclosure Statement&rdquo; form, available upon request from the office of the clerk, must be filed by certain corporations, trade associations, and others appearing as parties, intervenors, or <em>amicus curiae</em>. A copy of the &ldquo;Disclosure Statement&rdquo; form is shown in Form 13 of the Appendix of Forms.</p>
<p class="note-body">Internal inconsistencies exist within the provisions of the Customs Courts Act of 1980 with respect to the method of commencing two kinds of actions. The two kinds are described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(d), adjustment assistance actions, and 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(g), customhouse broker license actions. Both of these are included among those actions which are, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2632(a), to be commenced by filing concurrently a summons and complaint with the clerk of the court as prescribed by the rules of the court. The rules of the court require the plaintiff to cause concurrent service of the summons and complaint to be made. (See Rules 3(a) and 4(b)).</p>
<p class="note-body">The inconsistency pertaining to adjustment assistance actions appears in 19 U.S.C. &sect;2395, which requires the clerk of the court, instead of the plaintiff, to serve a copy of the summons and complaint upon the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Commerce as the case may be. The inconsistency pertaining to customhouse broker license actions appears in 19 U.S.C. &sect;1641(b), which provides that an action is commenced by filing &ldquo;a written petition&rdquo; in the court and further provides that a copy of the petition is to be &ldquo;transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of the Treasury.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Until such time as the matter is resolved, the preferred procedure to achieve uniformity and consistency and to minimize the ambiguity created by these inconsistent statutory provisions is to follow the provisions in Title 28. (In one unreported case, <em>James A. Barnhart v. United States</em>, Court No. 81&ndash;3&ndash;00328, the court directed plaintiff to comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2632(a) by filing a summons and complaint notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff had complied with the requirements of 19 U.S.C. &sect;1641(b) by filing a petition.)</p>
<p class="note-body">As provided in Section 516A(a)(2) and (3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, a complaint shall be filed within 30 days after the filing of the summons. <em>See Georgetown Steel v. United States</em>, 801 F.2d 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">Nevertheless, counsel are encouraged to commence any action described in Section 516A(a)(2) or (3) of the Tariff Act of 1930 and 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c) by the concurrent filing of a summons and complaint. This will serve to expedite the prosecution of the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">When an action is commenced, counsel should contact the Clerk's Office not more than 24 hours prior to filing to obtain a court number and shall endorse that court number on the summons and complaint. Counsel for plaintiff shall be responsible for service of the summons and complaint as prescribed in Rules 4(b), (c), (d) and (e). Under these circumstances, the clerk of the court will not make service of the summons as prescribed in Rule 4(a)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although this rule requires that the two agencies subject to suit under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c) are in the first instance the subject of separate summonses and complaints, it does not prohibit consolidation of actions against the two agencies upon an adequate showing of grounds for consolidation.</p>
