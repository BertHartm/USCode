<h3 class="analysis-subhead">I. CARRIER'S REQUEST FOR ADMISSION OF FACTS</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>1. Time for Filing Request.</strong> In every suit filed by a common carrier for the recovery of freight and/or passenger transportation charges, the carrier shall, at the time the complaint is filed or within 30 days thereafter, file with the clerk a request for admission by the defendant of the genuineness of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request and of the truth of the material matters of fact relied on by the carrier for recovery in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>2. Form and Content of Request.</strong> The request shall conform to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(A)</strong> Duplication. The request, with accompanying schedules and documents, may be typewritten, or may be printed, or otherwise mechanically reproduced from a typewritten original, provided that all copies filed with the clerk shall be clearly legible and that the words and figures shown therein shall be in large enough type to be read without difficulty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> Copies; Filing; Service. If the request accompanies the complaint, copies and service of such request shall be as provided in Rules 3(c) and 4. If the request is filed subsequent to the filing of the complaint, copies and service of such request shall be as provided in Rules 5, and 83, except that 5 copies shall be served on the defendant in lieu of a copy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> Signature of Attorney. The request shall be signed by the attorney of record for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(D)</strong> Numbered Paragraphs; Material Facts. The statements contained therein shall be properly separated and numbered and shall consist of specific statements of material facts which the plaintiff expects to prove as opposed to general allegations of the kind used in pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(E)</strong> Attachments. There shall be attached to the request copies of any contracts, letters, or other documents, excluding tariffs and other documents referred to in the schedules required by 2(G) and 2(I), which plaintiff proposes to offer in evidence, in order that the genuineness of such documents may be admitted by the defendant and the necessity of calling a witness to identify the same may be avoided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(F)</strong> Nature of Dispute; Statement of Issues. The statement in the request shall be sufficiently explicit to show the nature of the dispute and the specific reason or reasons why the plaintiff believes it is entitled to recover higher rates or charges than those allowed by the Government. The word &ldquo;dispute&rdquo; as used in the preceding sentence, means the shipment or shipments with respect to which the General Accounting Office or other agency of the Government determined that the carrier's charges had been overpaid or refused to pay the carrier's supplemental bills covering such shipments, rather than subsequent shipments which are not in dispute except for the fact that the overpay<!-- PDFPage:415 -->ments determined as to the shipments in dispute have been deducted from the amount of the carrier's bills covering such subsequent shipments. In order to show the nature of the dispute there shall be attached to or included in plaintiff's request a statement of the issues which, with respect to each group of the carrier's bills involving the same issue, shall consist of a brief narrative statement of such issue with a reference to (1) court decisions involving the same issue, or (2) the tariffs or other authority relied upon by plaintiff, and the tariffs or other authority which plaintiff believes defendant relied upon in making deductions for claimed overpayments to the carrier or in refusing to pay the carrier's supplemental bills for claimed undercharges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(G)</strong> Schedule: Claim for Transportation of Property. Where the claim is for the recovery of charges for the transportation of property for the Government, there shall be attached to the request a detailed schedule, prepared by or under the supervision of the general auditor, comptroller, or other principal accounting officer of the carrier. The schedule shall contain the following factual information:</p>

The schedule covering the transportation of passengers shall be certified in the same manner as provided in &nbsp;(2)(H), except that where a request includes schedules pertaining to claims for both the transportation of passengers and freight, one certification shall suffice for all schedules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3. Plaintiff's Noncompliance: Consequences.</strong> In the event a plaintiff in any action within the purview of this Appendix fails or refuses to comply with the provisions hereof, the judge may (1) refuse to allow it to support designated claims or prohibit it from introducing in evidence designated documents or items of testimony, or (2) take other appropriate action, which may include a dismissal of the complaint or any part thereof.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">II. DEFENDANT'S RESPONSE</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>4. Time for Filing; Order.</strong> Promptly after the filing of the plaintiff's request, the judge to whom the case is assigned shall, by order filed with the clerk, fix a reasonable time within which the defendant shall file its response to the request. A copy of such order shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>5. Copies; Service; Signature.</strong> The defendant's response shall consist of an original and two copies to be filed with the clerk and with service to be made on plaintiff as provided in Rule 5. The response shall be signed by defendant's attorney of record and shall comply with the terms of 2(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>6. Agreement; Modification; Denial.</strong> The defendant shall file such response within the time fixed by the order, agreeing to the separate items of fact, modifying the same in accordance with the facts known by the defendant, specifically denying the same, or setting forth in detail the reasons why it cannot truthfully admit or deny designated portions of the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>7. Defendant's Statement of Issues.</strong> If defendant does not agree with plaintiff's statement of the issues, it shall attach to or include in the response its statement of the issues, which, with respect to each group of the carrier's bills involving the same issue, shall consist of a brief narrative statement of the issue, as defendant contends, with reference to (1) a court decision involving the same issue, or (2) the tariffs or other authority relied upon by defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>8. Verification of Carrier's Computations.</strong> If the defendant finds that the schedule attached to plaintiff's request, or any portion affecting the amount claimed, is incorrect on the basis of the tariffs, &sect;22 quotations, or other authority relied on by plaintiff in its request, there shall be attached to the response a schedule prepared by the defendant, setting forth the facts and figures as to the amount of freight charges which defendant asserts would be due on each carrier's bill if the court holds that the tariffs or other authorities relied on by plaintiff in its request are applicable, and showing how the defendant arrived at any changes or corrections in the amounts claimed by plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>9. Schedule: Defendant's Basis for Applicable Charges.</strong> If the defendant claims that the tariffs, &sect;22 quotations, or other authority relied on by plaintiff are inapplicable with respect to any of <!-- PDFPage:417 -->the carrier's bills listed in plaintiff's request, there shall be attached to the response a schedule prepared by the defendant, setting forth the facts and figures in detail as to the amount of freight or passenger charges defendant claims is due on each disputed carrier's bill and containing a specific reference to the item or items in designated tariffs, &sect;22 quotations, or other authority relied on by defendant in support of its contention. The schedule shall also comply with the terms of &nbsp;2(G)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>10. Failure To Deny or Respond Within Specified Time: Consequences.</strong> Except where the response details the reasons why the defendant cannot admit or deny a particular statement in the request, any fact not so modified or denied in the response shall be deemed admitted, and the failure of the defendant to file its response within the time specified by the judge shall be taken as an admission of all of the facts as set forth in the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>11. Qualified Denial of Facts Available to Defendant: Consequences.</strong> Where the request sets forth any facts that are within the knowledge of the General Services Administration or of the department or agency of the defendant for which the transportation was performed&mdash;and these specifically include but are not limited to the facts and figures which plaintiff, by this order, is directed to include in its schedules&mdash;a response stating that defendant cannot truthfully admit or deny such facts, or a denial based on a lack of knowledge by defendant's attorney of record, shall be deemed an admission thereof, provided, that such a response shall not be deemed an admission if accompanied by the sworn statement of the official in charge of the records that a search has been made for the necessary documents or information and that the documents or information cannot be found.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>12. Relation to Pleadings; Time for Filing Answer or Counterclaim.</strong> In all cases to which this procedure applies, the time for filing defendant's answer and any counterclaim asserted by it may, without regard to the provisions of RCFC 12 and 13, be contemporaneous with the date fixed by the judge for filing defendant's response to plaintiff's request, provided, however, that the period of limitations provided by 49 U.S.C. &sect;16(3)(d) within which the defendant may file a counterclaim is not extended by any rule set forth in this Appendix or by any order. At its option, the defendant may include the response in its answer or counterclaim, which pleadings, nevertheless, shall otherwise comply with the rules applicable to them.</p>
