<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Form. In every trial, the testimony of witnesses shall be taken in open court, unless a federal law, these rules, the Federal Rules of Evidence, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court provide otherwise. The court may, for good cause shown in compelling circumstances and upon appropriate safeguards, permit presentation of testimony in open court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Affirmation in Lieu of Oath. Whenever under these rules an oath is required to be taken, a solemn affirmation may be accepted in lieu thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Evidence on Motions. When a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Interpreters. The court may appoint an interpreter of its own selection and may fix the interpreter's reasonable compensation. The compensation shall be paid out of funds provided by law or by one or more of the parties as the court may direct, and may be taxed ultimately as costs, in the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Documents Specially Admissible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Reports&mdash;Depositions&mdash;Affidavits. In addition to other admissible evidence, when the value of merchandise or any of its components is in issue, reports or depositions of consuls, customs officers, and other officers of the United States and depositions and affidavits of other persons whose attendance cannot reasonably be had, may be admitted in evidence, as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2639(c), when served upon the opposing party in accordance with this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Service. A copy of any report, deposition or affidavit described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision (e), which is intended to be offered in evidence, shall be served on the opposing party with the request for trial. A party other than the party serving the request for trial shall serve a copy of any report, deposition or affidavit which that party intends to offer in evidence <!-- PDFPage:474 -->upon the opposing party within 15 days after service of the request for trial. Timely service of copies of such documents may be waived or the time extended upon consent, or by order of the court for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Objections. Objections to the admission of such documents in evidence may be made at the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Pricelists&mdash;Catalogs. When the value of merchandise is in issue, pricelists and catalogs may be admitted into evidence when duly authenticated, relevant, and material.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Practice Comment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The availability of contemporaneous transmission per Rule 43(a) is in addition to other provisions of law and rules regarding the receipt of testimony and evidence in the court. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;256 (trials outside New York), 2639(c) (special evidence rules), and 2641 (confrontation of witnesses, inspection of evidence). These provisions may be factors in determining whether the court will permit the reception of testimony from a different location.</p>
