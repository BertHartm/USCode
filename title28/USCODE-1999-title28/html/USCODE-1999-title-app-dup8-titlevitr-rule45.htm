<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Form; Issuance.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> Every subpoena shall</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(A) state the name of the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) state the title of the action and its docket number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony or to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, documents or tangible things in the possession, custody and control of that person, or to permit inspection of premises, at a time and place therein specified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) set forth the test of subdivision (c) and (d) of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A command to produce evidence or to permit inspection may be joined with a command to appear at trial or hearing or at depositions, or may be issued separately. See Appendix L for subpoena forms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before service. An attorney as officer of the court may also issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the Court of Federal Claims. See Appendix L.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to such person and, if the person's attendance is commanded, by tendering to that person the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;1821. <!-- PDFPage:398 -->When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be tendered. Prior notice of any commanded production of documents and things or inspection of premises before trial shall be served on each party in the manner prescribed by Rule 5(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A) of this rule, a subpoena may be served at any place that is within 100 miles of the place of the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection specified in the subpoena; but the court upon proper application and good cause shown may authorize the service of a subpoena at any other place. A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country who is a national or resident of the United States shall issue under the circumstances and in the manner and be served as provided in Title 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> Proof of service when necessary shall be made by filing with the clerk a statement of the date and manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the person who made the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protection of Persons Subject to Subpoenas.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> A party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to that subpoena. The court shall enforce this duty and impose upon the party or attorney in breach of this duty an appropriate sanction, which may include, but is not limited to, lost earnings and a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)(A)</strong> A person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, documents or tangible things or inspection of premises need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless commanded to appear for deposition, hearing or trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this rule, a person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying may, within 14 days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than 14 days after service, serve upon the party or attorney designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials or of the premises. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the court. If objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an order to compel the production. Such an order to compel production shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying commanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)(A)</strong> On timely motion, the court shall quash or modify the subpoena if it</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) fails to allow reasonable time for compliance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter and no exception or waiver applies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) subjects a person to undue burden.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> If a subpoena</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) requires disclosure of a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) requires disclosure of an unretained expert's opinion or information not describing specific events or occurrences in dispute an resulting from the expert's study made not at the request of any party,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the court may, to protect a person subject to or affected by the subpoena, quash or modify the subpoena or, if the party on whose behalf the subpoena is issued shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship and assures that the person to whom the subpoena is addressed will be reasonably compensated, the court may order appearance or production only upon specified conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Duties in Responding to Subpoena.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable the demanding party to contest the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Contempt.</strong> Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued. An adequate cause for failure to obey exists when a subpoena purports to require a nonparty to attend or produce at a place not within the limits provided by clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A).</p>
