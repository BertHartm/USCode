<h3 class="analysis-subhead">TITLE II. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE SPECIAL MASTER</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3. Role of the Special Master&mdash;Generally.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Assignment.</strong> Once a petition has been filed by the clerk, the case shall be assigned by the chief special master to a special master to conduct proceedings in accordance with the Vaccine Rules. All proceedings prior to the issuance of the special master's decision are to be conducted exclusively by the special master.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Duties.</strong> The special master shall be responsible for conducting all proceedings, including requiring such evidence as may be appropriate, in order to prepare a decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining whether an award of compensation should be made under the Vaccine Act and the amount of any such award. The special master shall determine the nature of the proceedings, with the goal of making the proceedings expeditious, flexible, and less adversarial, while at the same time affording each party a full and fair opportunity to present its case and creating a record sufficient to allow review of the special master's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Absence; Reassignment.</strong> In the absence of the special master to whom a case is assigned, the chief special master may act on behalf of the assigned special master, or designate another <!-- PDFPage:429 -->special master to act. When necessary, the chief special master may reassign a case to another special master.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>4. Respondent's Review and Report.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Respondent's Review of Completeness of the Records.</strong> Within 30 days of the filing of a petition, respondent shall review the medical and other records to determine whether, in respondent's view, all records necessary to enable respondent to evaluate the merits of the claim have been supplied with the petition. If respondent considers that relevant records are missing, petitioner's counsel shall immediately be notified. If the parties disagree about the completeness of the records filed or the relevance of requested records, either party may request that the special master resolve the matter. If the special master concludes that records called for by Vaccine Rule 2(e) have not been submitted, the petition may be subject to dismissal, without prejudice, under Vaccine Rule 21(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Respondent's Report.</strong> Within 90 days after the filing of the petition, respondent shall file a report that shall set forth a full and complete statement of respondent's position as to why an award should or should not be granted. The report shall contain respondent's medical analysis of petitioner's claims. It shall also present any legal arguments that respondent may have in opposition to the petition. General denials are not sufficient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>5. Informal Review and Tentative Findings and Conclusions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The special master shall schedule an off-the-record conference to be held within 30 days of the filing of respondent's report pursuant to Vaccine Rule 4(b). At this conference, after affording the parties an opportunity to address each other's positions, the special master will review the materials submitted, evaluate the respective positions, and orally present tentative findings and conclusions. If necessary, the special master shall schedule a subsequent status conference to be held within 15 days at which petitioner and respondent shall advise whether either party requests further proceedings, including filing of dispositive motions or a hearing, or whether the special master should enter a decision consistent with the tentative findings and conclusions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>6. Status Conferences.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The special master shall conduct conferences from time to time in order to expedite the processing of the case. The conferences will be informal in nature and ordinarily will be conducted by telephone conference call. Either party may request a status conference at any time. At such conferences, counsel for both parties will have the opportunity to propose procedures by which to process the case in the least adversarial, most efficient way possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>7. Discovery.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be no discovery as a matter of right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Informal Discovery Preferred</strong>. The informal and cooperative exchange of information is the ordinary and preferred practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Formal Discovery</strong>. If a party considers that informal discovery is not sufficient, that party may seek to utilize the discovery procedures provided in RCFC 26&ndash;36 by filing a motion indicating the discovery sought and stating with particularity the reasons therefor, including an explanation why informal techniques have not been sufficient. Such a motion may also be made orally at a status conference.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Subpoena</strong>. When necessary, the special master upon request by a party may approve the issuance of a subpoena. In so doing, the procedures of RCFC 45 shall apply. See Appendix L.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>17. Filing and Service of Papers After the Petition.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Filing with the Clerk Defined.</strong> All pleadings and other papers required to be filed with the clerk by the Vaccine Rules or by order of the special master shall be forwarded to the clerk of the court at the address noted in Vaccine Rule 2. A document is filed with the Office of Special Masters when actually received and marked filed by the clerk, not when mailed. All matters shall be brought to the attention of the Office of Special Masters through filings with the clerk rather than by correspondence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Service.</strong> A copy of every document filed by any party with the clerk shall be served on the opposing party's attorney or the opposing party <em>pro se</em>, if no appearance of attorney has been entered. A certificate of service showing date of service shall be appended to the original and copies thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Date.</strong> Each filing shall bear on the signature page the date on which it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Number of Copies.</strong> The parties shall file an original and 2 copies of each paper required by the Vaccine Rules to be filed with the clerk.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> All filings with the clerk pursuant to the Vaccine Rules are to be made available only to the special master, judge, and parties, with the exception of certain court-produced documents as set forth in part (b) of this rule. A transcript prepared pursuant to Rule 8(e) shall be considered a filing for purposes of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Decisions and Certain Substantive Orders.</strong> All decisions of special masters, and any other substantive orders of a special master that the special master designates to be of precedential value, will be made available to the public, unless the document contains (1) trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged and confidential or (2) medical or similar information, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. When such a decision or designated substantive order is filed with the clerk, the petitioner will be afforded 14 days to identify and move to delete such information prior to disclosure of the document. If, upon review, the special master agrees that the identified material fits the above description, such material shall be deleted for the purpose of public access.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>19. Time.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Computation.</strong> In computing any period of time, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a federal holiday or, when the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court, a day on which weather or other conditions have made the clerk's office inaccessible, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a holiday. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded in the computation. Service by mail is complete upon mailing, but filing is not.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Enlargement.</strong> Motions for enlargement of time may be granted for good cause shown. A motion shall set forth the reason or reasons upon which the motion is based. Such motion must contain a representation that the moving party has discussed the motion with opposing counsel and a statement whether an opposition will be filed or, if opposing counsel cannot be consulted, an explanation of the efforts made to do so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Additional Time After Service by Mail.</strong> Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the service of a paper, and the service is made by mail, 3 calendar days shall be added to the prescribed period, unless the special master orders otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>20. Motions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Motions.</strong> A motion to the special master, unless made orally, shall be made in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be filed with the clerk. Any motion, objection, or response may be accompanied by a memorandum, and, if necessary, by supporting affidavits. Any motion may be accompanied by a proposed order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Responses and Replies.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by the special master, any response or objection to a written motion shall be filed within 14 days after service of the motion, and any reply shall be filed within 7 days after service of the response or objection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Oral Argument.</strong> Oral argument on a motion may be scheduled by the special master. A party desiring oral argument on a motion shall so request in the motion or response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>21. Dismissal of Petitions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Voluntary Dismissal; Effect Thereof.</strong> A petition may be dismissed by petitioner without <!-- PDFPage:432 -->order of the special master (1) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service of respondent's report or (2) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the proceeding. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal may, in the discretion of the special master, be deemed to operate as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a petitioner who has previously dismissed the same claim in the Office of Special Masters of the Court of Federal Claims or in the court itself.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure To Prosecute or Participate.</strong> If petitioner fails to prosecute, the petition may be dismissed pursuant to Vaccine Rule 21(c). No judgment shall be entered against respondent despite any failure of participation unless petitioner introduces evidence establishing a right to compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Involuntary Dismissal.</strong> For failure of petitioner to prosecute or to comply with the Vaccine Rules or any order of the special master, the special master may dismiss a petition or any claim therein.</p>
