<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Motion for Judgment. After issue is joined in any action in which a party believes that the determination of the court is to be made solely upon the basis of the record made before an agency, that party may move for judgment in its favor upon all or any part of the agency determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Cross-Motions. When a motion for judgment upon an agency record is filed by a party, an opposing party shall not file a cross-motion for judgment upon an agency record. If the court determines that judgment ought to be entered <!-- PDFPage:481 -->in favor of an opposing party, it may enter judgment in favor of that party, notwithstanding the absence of a cross-motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Briefs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to the other requirements prescribed by these rules, the briefs submitted on the motion, either contesting or supporting the agency determination, shall include a statement setting forth in separate numbered paragraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The administrative determination sought to be reviewed with appropriate reference to the Federal Register; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The issues of law presented together with the reasons for contesting or supporting the administrative determination, specifying how the determination may be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not otherwise in accordance with law, unsupported by substantial evidence; or, how the determination may be unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the agency may or may not have considered facts which, as a matter of law, should or should not have been properly considered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The brief shall include the authorities relied upon and the conclusions of law deemed warranted by the authorities. All references to the administrative record shall be made by citing the portions of the record to the factual or legal issues raised. Citations shall be by page number of the transcript, if any, and by specific identification of exhibits together with the relevant page number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Time to Respond. A response to a motion for judgment upon an agency record shall be served within 30 days after service of the motion. The moving party shall have 10 days after service of the response to the motion to serve a reply. No other papers or briefs shall be allowed, except by leave of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Hearing. Upon motion of a party, or upon its own initiative, the court may direct oral argument on a motion for judgment upon an agency record at a time and place designated as prescribed in Rule 77(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Partial Judgment. After considering a motion filed under this rule, the court may grant judgment in whole or in part in favor of any party.</p>
