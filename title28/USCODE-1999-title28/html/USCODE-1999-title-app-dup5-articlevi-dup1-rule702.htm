<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">An intelligent evaluation of facts is often difficult or impossible without the application of some scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge. The most common source of this knowledge is the expert witness, although there are other techniques for supplying it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Most of the literature assumes that experts testify only in the form of opinions. The assumption is logically unfounded. The rule accordingly recognizes that <!-- PDFPage:314 -->an expert on the stand may give a dissertation or exposition of scientific or other principles relevant to the case, leaving the trier of fact to apply them to the facts. Since much of the criticism of expert testimony has centered upon the hypothetical question, it seems wise to recognize that opinions are not indispensable and to encourage the use of expert testimony in non-opinion form when counsel believes the trier can itself draw the requisite inference. The use of opinions is not abolished by the rule, however. It will continue to be permissible for the experts to take the further step of suggesting the inference which should be drawn from applying the specialized knowledge to the facts. See Rules 703 to 705.</p>
<p class="note-body">Whether the situation is a proper one for the use of expert testimony is to be determined on the basis of assisting the trier. &ldquo;There is no more certain test for determining when experts may be used than the common sense inquiry whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in the dispute.&rdquo; Ladd, Expert Testimony, 5 Vand.L.Rev. 414, 418 (1952). When opinions are excluded, it is because they are unhelpful and therefore superfluous and a waste of time. 7 Wigmore &sect;1918.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is broadly phrased. The fields of knowledge which may be drawn upon are not limited merely to the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; and &ldquo;technical&rdquo; but extend to all &ldquo;specialized&rdquo; knowledge. Similarly, the expert is viewed, not in a narrow sense, but as a person qualified by &ldquo;knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.&rdquo; Thus within the scope of the rule are not only experts in the strictest sense of the word, e.g., physicians, physicists, and architects, but also the large group sometimes called &ldquo;skilled&rdquo; witnesses, such as bankers or landowners testifying to land values.</p>
