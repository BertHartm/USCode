<p class="statutory-body">These rules govern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil nature whether cognizable as cases at law or in equity or in admiralty, with the exceptions stated in Rule 81. They shall be construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. Rule 81 states certain limitations in the application of these rules to enumerated special proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The expression &ldquo;district courts of the United States&rdquo; appearing in the statute authorizing the Supreme Court of the United States to promulgate rules of civil procedure does not include the district courts held in the Territories and insular possessions. See <em>Mookini et al. v. United States</em>, 303 U.S. 201, 58 S.Ct. 543, 82 L.Ed. 748 (1938).</p>
<p class="note-body">3. These rules are drawn under the authority of the act of June 19, 1934, U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;723b [see 2072] (Rules in actions at law; Supreme Court authorized to make), and &sect;723c [see 2072] (Union of equity and action at law rules; power of Supreme Court) and also other grants of rule making power to the Court. See Clark and Moore, <em>A New Federal Civil Procedure&mdash;I. The Background</em>, 44 Yale L.J. 387, 391 (1935). Under &sect;723b after the rules have taken effect all laws in conflict therewith are of no further force or effect. In accordance with &sect;723c the Court has united the general rules prescribed for cases in equity with those in actions at law so as to secure one form of civil action and procedure for both. See Rule 2 (One Form of Action). For the former practice in equity and at law see U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;&sect;723 and 730 [see 2071 et seq.] (conferring power on the Supreme Court to make rules of practice in equity) and the [former] Equity Rules promulgated thereunder; U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;724 (Conformity act): [former] Equity Rule 22 (Action at Law Erroneously Begun as Suit in Equity&mdash;Transfer); [former] Equity Rule 23 (Matters Ordinarily Determinable at Law When Arising in Suit in Equity to be Disposed of Therein); U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;397 (Amendments to pleadings when case brought to wrong side of court), and 398 (Equitable defenses and equitable relief in actions at law).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. With the second sentence compare U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;777 (Defects of form; amendments), 767 (Amendment of process); [former] Equity Rule 19 (Amendments Generally).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change in nomenclature conforms to the official designation of district courts in Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;132(a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This is the fundamental change necessary to effect unification of the civil and admiralty procedure. Just as the 1938 rules abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, this change would abolish the distinction between civil actions and suits in admiralty. See also Rule 81.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of this revision, adding the words &ldquo;and administered&rdquo; to the second sentence, is to recognize the affirmative duty of the court to exercise the authority conferred by these rules to ensure that civil litigation is resolved not only fairly, but also without undue cost or delay. As officers of the court, attorneys share this responsibility with the judge to whom the case is assigned.</p>
