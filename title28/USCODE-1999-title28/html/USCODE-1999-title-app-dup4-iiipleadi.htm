<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. A provision designating pleadings and defining a motion is common in the State practice acts. See Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937), ch. 110, &sect;156 (Designation and order of pleadings); 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9246 (Definition of motion); and N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;113 (Definition of motion). Former Equity Rules 18 (Pleadings&mdash;Technical Forms Abrogated), 29 (Defenses&mdash;How Presented), and 33 (Testing Sufficiency of Defense) abolished technical forms of pleading, demurrers, and pleas, and exceptions for insufficiency of an answer.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. <em>Note to Subdivision (a</em>). This preserves the substance of [former] Equity Rule 31 (Reply&mdash;When Required&mdash;When Cause at Issue). Compare the English practice, English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 23, r.r. 1, 2 (Reply to counterclaim; amended, 1933, to be subject to the rules applicable to defenses, O. 21). See O. 21, r.r. 1&ndash;14; O. 27, r. 13 (When pleadings deemed denied and put in issue). Under the codes the pleadings are generally limited. A reply is sometimes required to an affirmative defense in the answer. 1 Colo.Stat.Ann. (1935) &sect;66; Ore.Code Ann. (1930) <!-- PDFPage:93 -->&sect;&sect;1&ndash;614, 1&ndash;616. In other jurisdictions no reply is necessary to an affirmative defense in the answer, but a reply may be ordered by the court. N.C.Code Ann. (1935) &sect;525; 1 S.D.Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;2357. A reply to a counterclaim is usually required. Ark.Civ.Code (Crawford, 1934) &sect;&sect;123&ndash;125; Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;&sect;263.20, 263.21. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;45 (District courts; practice and procedure in certain cases) is modified insofar as it may dispense with a reply to a counterclaim.</p>
<p class="note-body">For amendment of pleadings, see Rule 15 dealing with amended and supplemental pleadings.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. All statutes which use the words &ldquo;petition&rdquo;, &ldquo;bill of complaint&rdquo;, &ldquo;plea&rdquo;, &ldquo;demurrer&rdquo;, and other such terminology are modified in form by this rule.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment [to subdivision (a)] eliminates any question as to whether the compulsory reply, where a counterclaim is pleaded, is a reply only to the counterclaim or is a general reply to the answer containing the counterclaim. See Commentary, <em>Scope of Reply Where Defendant Has Pleaded Counterclaim</em> (1939) 1 Fed.Rules Serv. 672; <em>Fort Chartres and Ivy Landing Drainage and Levee District No. Five v. Thompson</em> (E.D.Ill. 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 13.32, Case 1.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Certain redundant words are eliminated and the subdivision is modified to reflect the amendment of Rule 14(a) which in certain cases eliminates the requirement of obtaining leave to bring in a third-party defendant.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">One of the reasons sanctions against improper motion practice have been employed infrequently is the lack of clarity of Rule 7. That rule has stated only generally that the pleading requirements relating to captions, signing, and other matters of form also apply to motions and other papers. The addition of Rule 7(b)(3) makes explicit the applicability of the signing requirement and the sanctions of Rule 11, which have been amplified.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Claims for Relief</cap-smallcap>. A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Defenses; Form of Denials</cap-smallcap>. A party shall state in short and plain terms the party's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If a party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the party shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, the pleader shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, the pleader may make denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs or may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the pleader expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all its averments, including averments of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, the pleader may do so by general denial subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative Defenses</cap-smallcap>. In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Failure To Deny</cap-smallcap>. Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Pleading To Be Concise and Direct; Consistency.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal, equitable, or maritime grounds. All statements shall be made subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 11.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Construction of Pleadings</cap-smallcap>. All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a</em>). See [former] Equity Rules 25 (Bill of Complaint&mdash;Contents), and 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim). Compare 2 Ind.Stat.Ann. (Burns, 1933) &sect;&sect;2&ndash;1004, 2&ndash;1015; 2 Ohio Gen.Code Ann. (Page, 1926) &sect;&sect;11305, 11314; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933), &sect;&sect;104&ndash;7&ndash;2, 104&ndash;9&ndash;1.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 19(c) for the requirement of a statement in a claim for relief of the names of persons who ought to be parties and the reason for their omission.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 23(b) for particular requirements as to the complaint in a secondary action by shareholders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b</em>). 1. This rule supersedes the methods of pleading prescribed in U.S.C., Title 19, &sect;508 (Persons making seizures pleading general issue and providing special matter); U.S.C., Title 35, [former] &sect;&sect;40d (Providing under general issue, upon notice, that a statement in application for an extended patent is not true), 69 [now 282] (Pleading and proof in actions for infringement) and similar statutes.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This rule is, in part, [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), with the matter on denials largely from the Connecticut practice. See Conn.Practice Book (1934) &sect;&sect;107, 108, and 122; Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930) &sect;&sect;5508&ndash;5514. Compare the English practice, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 17&ndash;20.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c</em>). This follows substantially English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r. 15 and N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;242, with &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; omitted in this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d</em>). The first sentence is similar to [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim). For the second sentence see [former] Equity Rule 31 (Reply&mdash;When Required&mdash;When Cause at Issue). This is similar to English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 13, 18; and to the practice in the States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e</em>). This rule is an elaboration upon [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), plus a statement of the actual practice under some codes. Compare also [former] Equity Rule 18 (Pleadings&mdash;Technical Forms Abrogated). See Clark, Code Pleading (1928), pp. 171&ndash;4, 432&ndash;5; Hankin, <em>Alternative and Hypothetical Pleading</em> (1924), 33 Yale L.J. 365.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (f</em>). A provision of like import is of frequent occurrence in the codes. Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;157(3); 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9266; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;275; 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7458.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Capacity</cap-smallcap>. It is not necessary to aver the capacity of a party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity or the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party, except to the extent required to show the jurisdiction of the court. When a party desires to raise an issue as to the legal existence of any party or the capacity of any party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, the party desiring to raise the issue shall do so by specific negative averment, which shall include such supporting particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader's knowledge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Fraud, Mistake, Condition of the Mind</cap-smallcap>. In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Conditions Precedent</cap-smallcap>. In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Official Document or Act</cap-smallcap>. In pleading an official document or official act it is sufficient to aver that the document was issued or the act done in compliance with law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Judgment</cap-smallcap>. In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or of a board or officer, it is sufficient to aver the judgment or decision without setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Time and Place</cap-smallcap>. For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of a pleading, averments of time and place are material and shall be considered like all other averments of material matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Special Damage</cap-smallcap>. When items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Admiralty and Maritime Claims</cap-smallcap>. A pleading or count setting forth a claim for relief within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction that is also within the jurisdiction of the district court on some other ground may contain a statement identifying the claim as an admiralty or maritime claim for the purposes of Rules 14(c), 38(e), 82, and the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims. If the claim is cognizable only in admiralty, it is an admiralty or maritime claim for those purposes whether so identified or not. The amendment of a pleading to add or withdraw an identifying statement is governed by the principles of Rule 15. A case that includes an admiralty or maritime claim within this subdivision is an admiralty case within 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(a)(3).</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Certain distinctive features of the admiralty practice must be preserved for what are now suits in admiralty. This raises the question: After unification, when a single form of action is established, how will the counterpart of the present suit in admiralty be identifiable? In part the question is easily answered. Some claims for relief can only be suits in admiralty, either because the admiralty jurisdiction is exclusive or because no nonmaritime ground of federal jurisdiction exists. Many claims, however, are cognizable by the district courts whether asserted in admiralty or in a civil action, assuming the existence of a nonmaritime ground of jurisdiction. Thus at present the pleader has power to determine procedural consequences by the way in which he exercises the classic privilege given by the saving-to-suitors clause (28 U.S.C. &sect;1333) or by equivalent statutory provisions. For example, a longshoreman's claim for personal injuries suffered by reason of the unseaworthiness of a vessel may be asserted in a suit in admiralty or, if diversity of citizenship exists, in a civil action. One of the important procedural consequences is that in the civil action either party may demand a jury trial, while in the suit in admiralty there is no right to jury trial except as provided by statute.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is no part of the purpose of unification to inject a right to jury trial into those admiralty cases in which that right is not provided by statute. Similarly as will be more specifically noted below, there is no disposition to change the present law as to interlocutory appeals in admiralty, or as to the venue of suits in admiralty; and, of course, there is no disposition to inject into the civil practice as it now is the distinctively maritime remedies (maritime attachment and garnishment, actions in rem, possessory, petitory and partition actions and limitation of liability). The unified rules must therefore provide some device for preserving the present power of the pleader to determine whether these historically maritime procedures shall be applicable to his claim or not; the pleader must be afforded some means of designating his claim as the counterpart of the present suit in admiralty, where its character as such is not clear.</p>
<p class="note-body">The problem is different from the similar one concerning the identification of claims that were formerly suits in equity. While that problem is not free from complexities, it is broadly true that the modern counterpart of the suit in equity is distinguishable from the former action at law by the character of the relief sought. This mode of identification is possible in only a limited category of admiralty cases. In large numbers of cases the relief sought in admiralty is simple money damages, indistinguishable from the remedy afforded by the common law. This is true, for example, in the case of the longshoreman's action for personal injuries stated above. After unification has abolished the distinction between civil actions and suits in admiralty, the complaint in such an action would be almost completely ambiguous as to the pleader's intentions regarding the procedure invoked. The allegation of diversity of citizenship might be regarded as a clue indicating an intention to proceed as at present under the saving-to-suitors clause; but this, too, would be ambiguous if there were also reference to the admiralty jurisdiction, and the pleader ought not be required to forego mention of all available jurisdictional grounds.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other methods of solving the problem were carefully explored, but the Advisory Committee concluded that the preferable solution is to allow the pleader who now has power to determine procedural consequences by filing a suit in admiralty to exercise that power under unification, for the limited instances in which procedural differences will remain, by a simple statement in his pleading to the effect that the claim is an admiralty or maritime claim.</p>
<p class="note-body">The choice made by the pleader in identifying or in failing to identify his claim as an admiralty or maritime claim is not an irrevocable election. The rule provides that the amendment of a pleading to add or withdraw an identifying statement is subject to the principles of Rule 15.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1968 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment eliminates the reference to Rule 73 which is to be abrogated and transfers to Rule 9(h) the substance of Subsection (h) of Rule 73 which preserved the right to an interlocutory appeal in admiralty cases which is provided by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(a)(3).</p>

<p class="note-body">The reference to Rule 26(a) is deleted, in light of the transfer of that subdivision to Rule 30(a) and the elimination of the de bene esse procedure therefrom. See the Advisory Committee's note to Rule 30(a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1292(a)(3) of the Judicial Code provides for appeal from &ldquo;[i]nterlocutory decrees of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* district courts *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 9(h) was added in 1966 with the unification of civil and admiralty procedure. Civil Rule 73(h) was amended at the same time to provide that the &sect;1292(a)(3) reference &ldquo;to admiralty cases shall be construed to mean admiralty and maritime claims within the meaning of Rule 9(h).&rdquo; This provision was transferred to Rule 9(h) when the Appellate Rules were adopted.</p>
<p class="note-body">A single case can include both admiralty or maritime claims and nonadmiralty claims or parties. This combination reveals an ambiguity in the statement in present Rule 9(h) that an admiralty &ldquo;claim&rdquo; is an admiralty &ldquo;case.&rdquo; An order &ldquo;determining the rights and liabilities of the parties&rdquo; within the meaning of &sect;1292(a)(3) may resolve only a nonadmiralty claim, or may simultaneously resolve interdependent admiralty and nonadmiralty claims. Can appeal be taken as to the nonadmiralty matter, because it is part of a case that includes an admiralty claim, or is appeal limited to the admiralty claim?</p>
<p class="note-body">The courts of appeals have not achieved full uniformity in applying the &sect;1292(a)(3) requirement that an order &ldquo;determin[e] the rights and liabilities of the parties.&rdquo; It is common to assert that the statute should be construed narrowly, under the general policy that exceptions to the final judgment rule should be construed narrowly. This policy would suggest that the ambiguity should be resolved by limiting the interlocutory appeal right to orders that determine the rights and liabilities of the parties to an admiralty claim.</p>
<p class="note-body">A broader view is chosen by this amendment for two reasons. The statute applies to admiralty &ldquo;cases,&rdquo; and may itself provide for appeal from an order that disposes of a nonadmiralty claim that is joined in a single <!-- PDFPage:96 -->case with an admiralty claim. Although a rule of court may help to clarify and implement a statutory grant of jurisdiction, the line is not always clear between permissible implementation and impermissible withdrawal of jurisdiction. In addition, so long as an order truly disposes of the rights and liabilities of the parties within the meaning of &sect;1292(a)(3), it may prove important to permit appeal as to the nonadmiralty claim. Disposition of the nonadmiralty claim, for example, may make it unnecessary to consider the admiralty claim and have the same effect on the case and parties as disposition of the admiralty claim. Or the admiralty and nonadmiralty claims may be interdependent. An illustration is provided by <em>Roco Carriers, Ltd. v. M/V Nurnberg Express</em>, 899 F.2d 1292 (2d Cir. 1990). Claims for losses of ocean shipments were made against two defendants, one subject to admiralty jurisdiction and the other not. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the admiralty defendant and against the nonadmiralty defendant. The nonadmiralty defendant's appeal was accepted, with the explanation that the determination of its liability was &ldquo;integrally linked with the determination of non-liability&rdquo; of the admiralty defendant, and that &ldquo;section 1292(a)(3) is not limited to admiralty <em>claims</em>; instead, it refers to admiralty <em>cases</em>.&rdquo; 899 F.2d at 1297. The advantages of permitting appeal by the nonadmiralty defendant would be particularly clear if the plaintiff had appealed the summary judgment in favor of the admiralty defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">It must be emphasized that this amendment does not rest on any particular assumptions as to the meaning of the &sect;1292(a)(3) provision that limits interlocutory appeal to orders that determine the rights and liabilities of the parties. It simply reflects the conclusion that so long as the case involves an admiralty claim and an order otherwise meets statutory requirements, the opportunity to appeal should not turn on the circumstance that the order does&mdash;or does not&mdash;dispose of an admiralty claim. No attempt is made to invoke the authority conferred by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(e) to provide by rule for appeal of an interlocutory decision that is not otherwise provided for by other subsections of &sect;1292.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 11. Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to Court; Sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Signature</cap-smallcap>. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party. Each paper shall state the signer's address and telephone number, if any. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. An unsigned paper shall be stricken unless omission of the signature is corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Representations to Court</cap-smallcap>. By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Sanctions</cap-smallcap>. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court <!-- PDFPage:97 -->may, subject to the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>How Initiated.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>By Motion</em>. A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b). It shall be served as provided in Rule 5, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other period as the court may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. If warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>On Court's Initiative</em>. On its own initiative, the court may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Nature of Sanction; Limitations</em>. A sanction imposed for violation of this rule shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the sanction may consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into court, or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party for a violation of subdivision (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's initiative unless the court issues its order to show cause before a voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Order</em>. When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Inapplicability to Discovery</cap-smallcap>. Subdivisions (a) through (c) of this rule do not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to the provisions of Rules 26 through 37.</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Since its original promulgation, Rule 11 has provided for the striking of pleadings and the imposition of disciplinary sanctions to check abuses in the signing of pleadings. Its provisions have always applied to motions and other papers by virtue of incorporation by reference in Rule 7(b)(2). The amendment and the addition of Rule 7(b)(3) expressly confirms this applicability.</p>
<p class="note-body">Experience shows that in practice Rule 11 has not been effective in deterring abuses. See 6 Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;1334 (1971). There has been considerable confusion as to (1) the circumstances that should trigger striking a pleading or motion or taking disciplinary action, (2) the standard of conduct expected of attorneys who sign pleadings and motions, and (3) the range of available and appropriate sanctions. See Rodes, Ripple & Mooney, <em>Sanctions Imposable for Violations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em> 64&ndash;65, Federal Judicial Center (1981). The new language is intended to reduce the reluctance of courts to impose sanctions, see Moore, <em>Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;7.05, at 1547, by emphasizing the responsibilities of the attorney and reenforcing those obligations by the imposition of sanctions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule attempts to deal with the problem by building upon and expanding the equitable doctrine permitting the court to award expenses, including attorney's fees, to a litigant whose opponent acts in bad faith in instituting or conducting litigation. See, <em>e.g., Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper</em>, 447 U.S. 752, (1980); <em>Hall v. Cole</em>, 412 U.S. 1, 5 (1973). Greater attention by the district courts to pleading and motion abuses and the imposition of sanctions when appropriate, should discourage dilatory or abusive tactics and help to streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous claims or defenses.</p>
<p class="note-body">The expanded nature of the lawyer's certification in the fifth sentence of amended Rule 11 recognizes that the litigation process may be abused for purposes other than delay. See, <em>e.g., Browning Debenture Holders&rsquo; Committee v. DASA Corp</em>., 560 F.2d 1078 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;good ground to support&rdquo; the pleading in the original rule were interpreted to have both factual and legal elements. See, <em>e.g., Heart Disease Research Foundation v. General Motors Corp</em>., 15 Fed.R.Serv. 2d 1517, 1519 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). They have been replaced by a standard of conduct that is more focused.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:98 --><p class="note-body">The new language stresses the need for some prefiling inquiry into both the facts and the law to satisfy the affirmative duty imposed by the rule. The standard is one of reasonableness under the circumstances. See <em>Kinee v. Abraham Lincoln Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n</em>, 365 F.Supp. 975 (E.D.Pa. 1973). This standard is more stringent than the original good-faith formula and thus it is expected that a greater range of circumstances will trigger its violation. See <em>Nemeroff v. Abelson</em>, 620 F.2d 339 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is not intended to chill an attorney's enthusiasm or creativity in pursuing factual or legal theories. The court is expected to avoid using the wisdom of hindsight and should test the signer's conduct by inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the time the pleading, motion, or other paper was submitted. Thus, what constitutes a reasonable inquiry may depend on such factors as how much time for investigation was available to the signer; whether he had to rely on a client for information as to the facts underlying the pleading, motion, or other paper; whether the pleading, motion, or other paper was based on a plausible view of the law; or whether he depended on forwarding counsel or another member of the bar.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not require a party or an attorney to disclose privileged communications or work product in order to show that the signing of the pleading, motion, or other paper is substantially justified. The provisions of Rule 26(c), including appropriate orders after <em>in camera</em> inspection by the court, remain available to protect a party claiming privilege or work product protection.</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended Rule 11 continues to apply to anyone who signs a pleading, motion, or other paper. Although the standard is the same for unrepresented parties, who are obliged themselves to sign the pleadings, the court has sufficient discretion to take account of the special circumstances that often arise in <em>pro se</em> situations. See <em>Haines v. Kerner</em> 404 U.S. 519 (1972).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in the original rule for striking pleadings and motions as sham and false has been deleted. The passage has rarely been utilized, and decisions thereunder have tended to confuse the issue of attorney honesty with the merits of the action. See generally Risinger, <em>Honesty in Pleading and its Enforcement: Some &ldquo;Striking&rdquo; Problems with Fed. R. Civ. P. 11</em>, 61 Minn.L.Rev. 1 (1976). Motions under this provision generally present issues better dealt with under Rules 8, 12, or 56. See <em>Murchison v. Kirby</em>, 27 F.R.D. 14 (S.D.N.Y. 1961); 5 Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;1334 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">The former reference to the inclusion of scandalous or indecent matter, which is itself strong indication that an improper purpose underlies the pleading, motion, or other paper, also has been deleted as unnecessary. Such matter may be stricken under Rule 12(f) as well as dealt with under the more general language of amended Rule 11.</p>
<p class="note-body">The text of the amended rule seeks to dispel apprehensions that efforts to obtain enforcement will be fruitless by insuring that the rule will be applied when properly invoked. The word &ldquo;sanctions&rdquo; in the caption, for example, stresses a deterrent orientation in dealing with improper pleadings, motions or other papers. This corresponds to the approach in imposing sanctions for discovery abuses. See <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club</em>, 427 U.S. 639 (1976) (per curiam). And the words &ldquo;shall impose&rdquo; in the last sentence focus the court's attention on the need to impose sanctions for pleading and motion abuses. The court, however, retains the necessary flexibility to deal appropriately with violations of the rule. It has discretion to tailor sanctions to the particular facts of the case, with which it should be well acquainted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference in the former text to wilfullness as a prerequisite to disciplinary action has been deleted. However, in considering the nature and severity of the sanctions to be imposed, the court should take account of the state of the attorney's or party's actual or presumed knowledge when the pleading or other paper was signed. Thus, for example, when a party is not represented by counsel, the absence of legal advice is an appropriate factor to be considered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Courts currently appear to believe they may impose sanctions on their own motion. See <em>North American Trading Corp. v. Zale Corp</em>., 73 F.R.D. 293 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). Authority to do so has been made explicit in order to overcome the traditional reluctance of courts to intervene unless requested by one of the parties. The detection and punishment of a violation of the signing requirement, encouraged by the amended rule, is part of the court's responsibility for securing the system's effective operation.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the duty imposed by the rule is violated, the court should have the discretion to impose sanctions on either the attorney, the party the signing attorney represents, or both, or on an unrepresented party who signed the pleading, and the new rule so provides. Although Rule 11 has been silent on the point, courts have claimed the power to impose sanctions on an attorney personally, either by imposing costs or employing the contempt technique. See 5 Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;1334 (1969); 2A Moore, <em>Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;11.02, at 2104 n.8. This power has been used infrequently. The amended rule should eliminate any doubt as to the propriety of assessing sanctions against the attorney.</p>
<p class="note-body">Even though it is the attorney whose signature violates the rule, it may be appropriate under the circumstances of the case to impose a sanction on the client. See <em>Browning Debenture Holders&rsquo; Committee v. DASA Corp., supra</em>. This modification brings Rule 11 in line with practice under Rule 37, which allows sanctions for abuses during discovery to be imposed upon the party, the attorney, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body">A party seeking sanctions should give notice to the court and the offending party promptly upon discovering a basis for doing so. The time when sanctions are to be imposed rests in the discretion of the trial judge. However, it is anticipated that in the case of pleadings the sanctions issue under Rule 11 normally will be determined at the end of the litigation, and in the case of motions at the time when the motion is decided or shortly thereafter. The procedure obviously must comport with due process requirements. The particular format to be followed should depend on the circumstances of the situation and the severity of the sanction under consideration. In many situations the judge's participation in the proceedings provides him with full knowledge of the relevant facts and little further inquiry will be necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">To assure that the efficiencies achieved through more effective operation of the pleading regimen will not be offset by the cost of satellite litigation over the imposition of sanctions, the court must to the extent possible limit the scope of sanction proceedings to the record. Thus, discovery should be conducted only by leave of the court, and then only in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the encompassing reference to &ldquo;other papers&rdquo; in new Rule 11 literally includes discovery papers, the certification requirement in that context is governed by proposed new Rule 26(g). Discovery motions, however, fall within the ambit of Rule 11.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Purpose of revision</em>. This revision is intended to remedy problems that have arisen in the interpretation and application of the 1983 revision of the rule. For empirical examination of experience under the 1983 rule, see, <em>e.g</em>., New York State Bar Committee on Federal Courts, <em>Sanctions and Attorneys&rsquo; Fees</em> (1987); T. Willging, <em>The Rule 11 Sanctioning Process</em> (1989); American Judicature Society, <em>Report of the Third Circuit Task Force on Federal <!-- PDFPage:99 -->Rule of Civil Procedure 11</em> (S. Burbank ed., 1989); E. Wiggins, T. Willging, and D. Stienstra, <em>Report on Rule 11</em> (Federal Judicial Center 1991). For book-length analyses of the case law, see G. Joseph, <em>Sanctions: The Federal Law of Litigation Abuse</em> (1989); J. Solovy, <em>The Federal Law of Sanctions</em> (1991); G. Vairo, <em>Rule 11 Sanctions: Case Law Perspectives and Preventive Measures</em> (1991).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule retains the principle that attorneys and pro se litigants have an obligation to the court to refrain from conduct that frustrates the aims of Rule 1. The revision broadens the scope of this obligation, but places greater constraints on the imposition of sanctions and should reduce the number of motions for sanctions presented to the court. New subdivision (d) removes from the ambit of this rule all discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions subject to the provisions of Rule 26 through 37.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Retained in this subdivision are the provisions requiring signatures on pleadings, written motions, and other papers. Unsigned papers are to be received by the Clerk, but then are to be stricken if the omission of the signature is not corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or pro se litigant. Correction can be made by signing the paper on file or by submitting a duplicate that contains the signature. A court may require by local rule that papers contain additional identifying information regarding the parties or attorneys, such as telephone numbers to facilitate facsimile transmissions, though, as for omission of a signature, the paper should not be rejected for failure to provide such information.</p>
<p class="note-body">The sentence in the former rule relating to the effect of answers under oath is no longer needed and has been eliminated. The provision in the former rule that signing a paper constitutes a certificate that it has been read by the signer also has been eliminated as unnecessary. The obligations imposed under subdivision (b) obviously require that a pleading, written motion, or other paper be read before it is filed or submitted to the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b) and (c)</em>. These subdivisions restate the provisions requiring attorneys and pro se litigants to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the law and facts before signing pleadings, written motions, and other documents, and prescribing sanctions for violation of these obligations. The revision in part expands the responsibilities of litigants to the court, while providing greater constraints and flexibility in dealing with infractions of the rule. The rule continues to require litigants to &ldquo;stop-and-think&rdquo; before initially making legal or factual contentions. It also, however, emphasizes the duty of candor by subjecting litigants to potential sanctions for insisting upon a position after it is no longer tenable and by generally providing protection against sanctions if they withdraw or correct contentions after a potential violation is called to their attention.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule applies only to assertions contained in papers filed with or submitted to the court. It does not cover matters arising for the first time during oral presentations to the court, when counsel may make statements that would not have been made if there had been more time for study and reflection. However, a litigant's obligations with respect to the contents of these papers are not measured solely as of the time they are filed with or submitted to the court, but include reaffirming to the court and advocating positions contained in those pleadings and motions after learning that they cease to have any merit. For example, an attorney who during a pretrial conference insists on a claim or defense should be viewed as &ldquo;presenting to the court&rdquo; that contention and would be subject to the obligations of subdivision (b) measured as of that time. Similarly, if after a notice of removal is filed, a party urges in federal court the allegations of a pleading filed in state court (whether as claims, defenses, or in disputes regarding removal or remand), it would be viewed as &ldquo;presenting&rdquo;&mdash;and hence certifying to the district court under Rule 11&mdash;those allegations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The certification with respect to allegations and other factual contentions is revised in recognition that sometimes a litigant may have good reason to believe that a fact is true or false but may need discovery, formal or informal, from opposing parties or third persons to gather and confirm the evidentiary basis for the allegation. Tolerance of factual contentions in initial pleadings by plaintiffs or defendants when specifically identified as made on information and belief does not relieve litigants from the obligation to conduct an appropriate investigation into the facts that is reasonable under the circumstances; it is not a license to join parties, make claims, or present defenses without any factual basis or justification. Moreover, if evidentiary support is not obtained after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery, the party has a duty under the rule not to persist with that contention. Subdivision (b) does not require a formal amendment to pleadings for which evidentiary support is not obtained, but rather calls upon a litigant not thereafter to advocate such claims or defenses.</p>
<p class="note-body">The certification is that there is (or likely will be) &ldquo;evidentiary support&rdquo; for the allegation, not that the party will prevail with respect to its contention regarding the fact. That summary judgment is rendered against a party does not necessarily mean, for purposes of this certification, that it had no evidentiary support for its position. On the other hand, if a party has evidence with respect to a contention that would suffice to defeat a motion for summary judgment based thereon, it would have sufficient &ldquo;evidentiary support&rdquo; for purposes of Rule 11.</p>
<p class="note-body">Denials of factual contentions involve somewhat different considerations. Often, of course, a denial is premised upon the existence of evidence contradicting the alleged fact. At other times a denial is permissible because, after an appropriate investigation, a party has no information concerning the matter or, indeed, has a reasonable basis for doubting the credibility of the only evidence relevant to the matter. A party should not deny an allegation it knows to be true; but it is not required, simply because it lacks contradictory evidence, to admit an allegation that it believes is not true.</p>
<p class="note-body">The changes in subdivisions (b)(3) and (b)(4) will serve to equalize the burden of the rule upon plaintiffs and defendants, who under Rule 8(b) are in effect allowed to deny allegations by stating that from their initial investigation they lack sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation. If, after further investigation or discovery, a denial is no longer warranted, the defendant should not continue to insist on that denial. While sometimes helpful, formal amendment of the pleadings to withdraw an allegation or denial is not required by subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Arguments for extensions, modifications, or reversals of existing law or for creation of new law do not violate subdivision (b)(2) provided they are &ldquo;nonfrivolous.&rdquo; This establishes an objective standard, intended to eliminate any &ldquo;empty-head pure-heart&rdquo; justification for patently frivolous arguments. However, the extent to which a litigant has researched the issues and found some support for its theories even in minority opinions, in law review articles, or through consultation with other attorneys should certainly be taken into account in determining whether paragraph (2) has been violated. Although arguments for a change of law are not required to be specifically so identified, a contention that is so identified should be viewed with greater tolerance under the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court has available a variety of possible sanctions to impose for violations, such as striking the offending paper; issuing an admonition, reprimand, or censure; requiring participation in seminars or other educational programs; ordering a fine payable to the court; referring the matter to disciplinary authorities (or, in the case of government attorneys, to the Attorney General, Inspector General, or agency head), etc. <em>See Manual for Complex Litigation, Second</em>, &sect;42.3. The rule does not attempt to enumerate the factors a court should consider in deciding whether to impose a sanc<!-- PDFPage:100 -->tion or what sanctions would be appropriate in the circumstances; but, for emphasis, it does specifically note that a sanction may be nonmonetary as well as monetary. Whether the improper conduct was willful, or negligent; whether it was part of a pattern of activity, or an isolated event; whether it infected the entire pleading, or only one particular count or defense; whether the person has engaged in similar conduct in other litigation; whether it was intended to injure; what effect it had on the litigation process in time or expense; whether the responsible person is trained in the law; what amount, given the financial resources of the responsible person, is needed to deter that person from repetition in the same case; what amount is needed to deter similar activity by other litigants: all of these may in a particular case be proper considerations. The court has significant discretion in determining what sanctions, if any, should be imposed for a violation, subject to the principle that the sanctions should not be more severe than reasonably necessary to deter repetition of the conduct by the offending person or comparable conduct by similarly situated persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the purpose of Rule 11 sanctions is to deter rather than to compensate, the rule provides that, if a monetary sanction is imposed, it should ordinarily be paid into court as a penalty. However, under unusual circumstances, particularly for [subdivision] (b)(1) violations, deterrence may be ineffective unless the sanction not only requires the person violating the rule to make a monetary payment, but also directs that some or all of this payment be made to those injured by the violation. Accordingly, the rule authorizes the court, if requested in a motion and if so warranted, to award attorney's fees to another party. Any such award to another party, however, should not exceed the expenses and attorneys&rsquo; fees for the services directly and unavoidably caused by the violation of the certification requirement. If, for example, a wholly unsupportable count were included in a multi-count complaint or counterclaim for the purpose of needlessly increasing the cost of litigation to an impecunious adversary, any award of expenses should be limited to those directly caused by inclusion of the improper count, and not those resulting from the filing of the complaint or answer itself. The award should not provide compensation for services that could have been avoided by an earlier disclosure of evidence or an earlier challenge to the groundless claims or defenses. Moreover, partial reimbursement of fees may constitute a sufficient deterrent with respect to violations by persons having modest financial resources. In cases brought under statutes providing for fees to be awarded to prevailing parties, the court should not employ cost-shifting under this rule in a manner that would be inconsistent with the standards that govern the statutory award of fees, such as stated in <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC</em>, 434 U.S. 412 (1978).</p>
<p class="note-body">The sanction should be imposed on the persons&mdash;whether attorneys, law firms, or parties&mdash;who have violated the rule or who may be determined to be responsible for the violation. The person signing, filing, submitting, or advocating a document has a nondelegable responsibility to the court, and in most situations is the person to be sanctioned for a violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm is to be held also responsible when, as a result of a motion under subdivision (c)(1)(A), one of its partners, associates, or employees is determined to have violated the rule. Since such a motion may be filed only if the offending paper is not withdrawn or corrected within 21 days after service of the motion, it is appropriate that the law firm ordinarily be viewed as jointly responsible under established principles of agency. This provision is designed to remove the restrictions of the former rule. <em>Cf. Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group</em>, 493 U.S. 120 (1989) (1983 version of Rule 11 does not permit sanctions against law firm of attorney signing groundless complaint).</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision permits the court to consider whether other attorneys in the firm, co-counsel, other law firms, or the party itself should be held accountable for their part in causing a violation. When appropriate, the court can make an additional inquiry in order to determine whether the sanction should be imposed on such persons, firms, or parties either in addition to or, in unusual circumstances, instead of the person actually making the presentation to the court. For example, such an inquiry may be appropriate in cases involving governmental agencies or other institutional parties that frequently impose substantial restrictions on the discretion of individual attorneys employed by it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sanctions that involve monetary awards (such as a fine or an award of attorney's fees) may not be imposed on a represented party for causing a violation of subdivision (b)(2), involving frivolous contentions of law. Monetary responsibility for such violations is more properly placed solely on the party's attorneys. With this limitation, the rule should not be subject to attack under the Rules Enabling Act. <em>See Willy v. Coastal Corp</em>., &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; U.S. &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (1992); <em>Business Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enter. Inc</em>., &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; U.S. &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (1991). This restriction does not limit the court's power to impose sanctions or remedial orders that may have collateral financial consequences upon a party, such as dismissal of a claim, preclusion of a defense, or preparation of amended pleadings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Explicit provision is made for litigants to be provided notice of the alleged violation and an opportunity to respond before sanctions are imposed. Whether the matter should be decided solely on the basis of written submissions or should be scheduled for oral argument (or, indeed, for evidentiary presentation) will depend on the circumstances. If the court imposes a sanction, it must, unless waived, indicate its reasons in a written order or on the record; the court should not ordinarily have to explain its denial of a motion for sanctions. Whether a violation has occurred and what sanctions, if any, to impose for a violation are matters committed to the discretion of the trial court; accordingly, as under current law, the standard for appellate review of these decisions will be for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp</em>., 496 U.S. 384 (1990) (noting, however, that an abuse would be established if the court based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence).</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision leaves for resolution on a case-by-case basis, considering the particular circumstances involved, the question as to when a motion for violation of Rule 11 should be served and when, if filed, it should be decided. Ordinarily the motion should be served promptly after the inappropriate paper is filed, and, if delayed too long, may be viewed as untimely. In other circumstances, it should not be served until the other party has had a reasonable opportunity for discovery. Given the &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; provisions discussed below, a party cannot delay serving its Rule 11 motion until conclusion of the case (or judicial rejection of the offending contention).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 11 motions should not be made or threatened for minor, inconsequential violations of the standards prescribed by subdivision (b). They should not be employed as a discovery device or to test the legal sufficiency or efficacy of allegations in the pleadings; other motions are available for those purposes. Nor should Rule 11 motions be prepared to emphasize the merits of a party's position, to exact an unjust settlement, to intimidate an adversary into withdrawing contentions that are fairly debatable, to increase the costs of litigation, to create a conflict of interest between attorney and client, or to seek disclosure of matters otherwise protected by the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine. As under the prior rule, the court may defer its ruling (or its decision as to the identity of the persons to be sanctioned) until final resolution of the case in order to avoid immediate conflicts of interest and to reduce the disruption created if a disclosure of attorney-client communications is needed to determine whether a violation occurred or to identify the person responsible for the violation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule provides that requests for sanctions must be made as a separate motion, <em>i.e</em>., not simply included as <!-- PDFPage:101 -->an additional prayer for relief contained in another motion. The motion for sanctions is not, however, to be filed until at least 21 days (or such other period as the court may set) after being served. If, during this period, the alleged violation is corrected, as by withdrawing (whether formally or informally) some allegation or contention, the motion should not be filed with the court. These provisions are intended to provide a type of &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; against motions under Rule 11 in that a party will not be subject to sanctions on the basis of another party's motion unless, after receiving the motion, it refuses to withdraw that position or to acknowledge candidly that it does not currently have evidence to support a specified allegation. Under the former rule, parties were sometimes reluctant to abandon a questionable contention lest that be viewed as evidence of a violation of Rule 11; under the revision, the timely withdrawal of a contention will protect a party against a motion for sanctions.</p>
<p class="note-body">To stress the seriousness of a motion for sanctions and to define precisely the conduct claimed to violate the rule, the revision provides that the &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; period begins to run only upon service of the motion. In most cases, however, counsel should be expected to give informal notice to the other party, whether in person or by a telephone call or letter, of a potential violation before proceeding to prepare and serve a Rule 11 motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">As under former Rule 11, the filing of a motion for sanctions is itself subject to the requirements of the rule and can lead to sanctions. However, service of a cross motion under Rule 11 should rarely be needed since under the revision the court may award to the person who prevails on a motion under Rule 11&mdash;whether the movant or the target of the motion&mdash;reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The power of the court to act on its own initiative is retained, but with the condition that this be done through a show cause order. This procedure provides the person with notice and an opportunity to respond. The revision provides that a monetary sanction imposed after a court-initiated show cause order be limited to a penalty payable to the court and that it be imposed only if the show cause order is issued before any voluntary dismissal or an agreement of the parties to settle the claims made by or against the litigant. Parties settling a case should not be subsequently faced with an unexpected order from the court leading to monetary sanctions that might have affected their willingness to settle or voluntarily dismiss a case. Since show cause orders will ordinarily be issued only in situations that are akin to a contempt of court, the rule does not provide a &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; to a litigant for withdrawing a claim, defense, etc., after a show cause order has been issued on the court's own initiative. Such corrective action, however, should be taken into account in deciding what&mdash;if any&mdash;sanction to impose if, after consideration of the litigant's response, the court concludes that a violation has occurred.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Rules 26(g) and 37 establish certification standards and sanctions that apply to discovery disclosures, requests, responses, objections, and motions. It is appropriate that Rules 26 through 37, which are specially designed for the discovery process, govern such documents and conduct rather than the more general provisions of Rule 11. Subdivision (d) has been added to accomplish this result.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 11 is not the exclusive source for control of improper presentations of claims, defenses, or contentions. It does not supplant statutes permitting awards of attorney's fees to prevailing parties or alter the principles governing such awards. It does not inhibit the court in punishing for contempt, in exercising its inherent powers, or in imposing sanctions, awarding expenses, or directing remedial action authorized under other rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927. <em>See Chambers v. NASCO</em>, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; U.S. &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (1991). <em>Chambers</em> cautions, however, against reliance upon inherent powers if appropriate sanctions can be imposed under provisions such as Rule 11, and the procedures specified in Rule 11&mdash;notice, opportunity to respond, and findings&mdash;should ordinarily be employed when imposing a sanction under the court's inherent powers. Finally, it should be noted that Rule 11 does not preclude a party from initiating an independent action for malicious prosecution or abuse of process.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>When Presented.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Unless a different time is prescribed in a statute of the United States, a defendant shall serve an answer</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) within 20 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if service of the summons has been timely waived on request under Rule 4(d), within 60 days after the date when the request for waiver was sent, or within 90 days after that date if the defendant was addressed outside any judicial district of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A party served with a pleading stating a cross-claim against that party shall serve an answer thereto within 20 days after being served. The plaintiff shall serve a reply to a counterclaim in the answer within 20 days after service of the answer, or, if a reply is ordered by the court, within 20 days after service of the order, unless the order otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The United States or an officer or agency thereof shall serve an answer to the complaint or to a cross-claim, or a reply to a counterclaim, within 60 days after the service upon the United States attorney of the pleading in which the claim is asserted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Unless a different time is fixed by court order, the service of a motion permitted under this rule alters these periods of time as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served within 10 days after notice of the court's action; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading shall be served within 10 days after the service of the more definite statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>How Presented</cap-smallcap>. Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) improper venue, (4) insufficiency of process, (5) insufficiency of service of process, (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (7) failure to join a <!-- PDFPage:102 -->party under Rule 19. A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings</cap-smallcap>. After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Preliminary Hearings</cap-smallcap>. The defenses specifically enumerated (1)&ndash;(7) in subdivision (b) of this rule, whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment mentioned in subdivision (c) of this rule shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Motion for More Definite Statement</cap-smallcap>. If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after notice of the order or within such other time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Motion To Strike</cap-smallcap>. Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Consolidation of Defenses in Motion</cap-smallcap>. A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h)(2) hereof on any of the grounds there stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, or insufficiency of service of process is waived (A) if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision (g), or (B) if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a defense of failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 19, and an objection of failure to state a legal defense to a claim may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>

U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;763 [now 547] (Petition in action against United States; service; appearance by district attorney) provides that the United States as a defendant shall have 60 days within which to answer or otherwise defend. This and other statutes which provide 60 days for the United States or an officer or agency thereof to answer or otherwise defend are continued by this rule. Insofar as any statutes not excepted in Rule 81 provide a different time for a defendant to defend, such statutes are modified.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Various minor alterations in language have been made to improve the statement of the rule. All references to bills of particulars have been stricken in accordance with changes made in subdivision (e).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The addition of defense (7), &ldquo;failure to join an indispensable party&rdquo;, cures an omission in the rules, which are silent as to the mode of raising such failure. See Commentary, <em>Manner of Raising Objection of Non-Joinder of Indispensable Party</em> (1940) 2 Fed.Rules Serv. 658 and (1942) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 820. In one case, <em>United States v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co</em>. (E.D.Pa. 1941) 36 F.Supp. 399, the failure to join an indispensable party was raised under Rule 12(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12(b)(6), permitting a motion to dismiss for failure of the complaint to state a claim on which relief can be granted, is substantially the same as the old demurrer for failure of a pleading to state a cause of action. Some courts have held that as the rule by its terms refers to statements in the complaint, extraneous matter on affidavits, depositions or otherwise, may not be introduced in support of the motion, or to resist it. On the other hand, in many cases the district courts have permitted the introduction of such material. When these cases have reached circuit courts of appeals in situations where the extraneous material so received shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material question of fact and that on the undisputed facts as disclosed by the affidavits or depositions, one party or the other is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the circuit courts, properly enough, have been reluctant to dispose of the case merely on the face of the pleading, and in the interest of prompt disposition of the action have made a final disposition of it. In dealing with such situations the Second Circuit has made the sound suggestion that whatever its label or original basis, the motion may be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as such. <em>Samara v. United States</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 129 F.(2d) 594, cert. den. (1942) 317 U.S. 686; <em>Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 124 F.(2d) 822, cert. den. (1943) 317 U.S. 695. See also <em>Kithcart v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co</em>. (C.C.A.8th, 1945) 150 F.(2d) 997, aff'g 62 F.Supp. 93.</p>
<p class="note-body">It has also been suggested that this practice could be justified on the ground that the federal rules permit &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; motions. The Committee entertains the view that on motion under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss for failure of the complaint to state a good claim, the trial court should have authority to permit the introduction of extraneous matter, such as may be offered on a motion for summary judgment, and if it does not exclude such matter the motion should then be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of in the manner and on the conditions stated in Rule 56 relating to summary judgments, and, of course, in such a situation, when the case reaches the circuit court of appeals, that court should treat the motion in the same way. The Committee believes that such practice, however, should be tied to the summary judgment rule. The term &ldquo;speaking motion&rdquo; is not mentioned in the rules, and if there is such a thing its limitations are undefined. Where extraneous matter is received, by tying further proceedings to the summary judgment rule the courts have a definite basis in the rules for disposing of the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee emphasizes particularly the fact that the summary judgment rule does not permit a case to be disposed of by judgment on the merits on affidavits, which disclose a conflict on a material issue of fact, and unless this practice is tied to the summary judgment rule, the extent to which a court, on the introduction of such extraneous matter, may resolve questions of fact on conflicting proof would be left uncertain.</p>
<p class="note-body">The decisions dealing with this general situation may be generally grouped as follows: (1) cases dealing with the use of affidavits and other extraneous material on motions; (2) cases reversing judgments to prevent final determination on mere pleading allegations alone.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under group (1) are: <em>Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 124 F.(2d) 822, cert. den. (1943) 317 U.S. 695; <em>Gallup v.

<p class="note-body">The addition at the end of subdivision (b) makes it clear that on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) extraneous material may not be considered if the court excludes it, but that if the court does not exclude such material the motion shall be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56. It will also be observed that if a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) is thus converted into a summary judgment motion, the amendment insures that both parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to submit affidavits and extraneous proofs to avoid taking a party by surprise through the conversion of the motion into a motion for summary judgment. In this manner and to this extent the amendment regularizes the practice above described. As the courts are already dealing with cases in this way, the effect of this amendment is really only to define the practice carefully and apply the requirements of the summary judgment rule in the disposition of the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The sentence appended to subdivision (c) performs the same function and is grounded on the same reasons as the corresponding sentence added in subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The change here was made necessary because of the addition of defense (7) in subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. References in this subdivision to a bill of particulars have been deleted, and the motion provided for is confined to one for a more definite statement, to be obtained only in cases where the movant cannot reasonably be required to frame an answer or other responsive pleading to the pleading in question. With respect to preparations for trial, the party is properly relegated to the various methods of examination and discovery provided in the rules for that purpose. <em>Slusher v. Jones</em> (E.D.Ky. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.231, Case 5, 3 F.R.D. 168; <em>Best Foods, Inc. v. General Mills, Inc</em>.

Callaway</em> (E.D.Tenn. 1943) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.231, Case 1 (&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. most courts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. conclude that the definiteness required is only such as will be sufficient for the party to prepare responsive pleadings&rdquo;). Accordingly, the reference to the 20 day time limit has also been eliminated, since the purpose of this present provision is to state a time period where the motion for a bill is made for the purpose of preparing for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12(e) as originally drawn has been the subject of more judicial rulings than any other part of the rules, and has been much criticized by commentators, judges and members of the bar. See general discussion and cases cited in 1 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938), Cum.Supplement &sect;12.07, under &ldquo;Page 657&rdquo;; also, Holtzoff, <em>New Federal Procedure and the Courts</em> (1940) 35&ndash;41. And compare vote of Second Circuit Conference of Circuit and District Judges (June 1940) recommending the abolition of the bill of particulars; <em>Sun Valley Mfg. Co. v. Mylish</em> (E.D.Pa. 1944) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.231, Case 6 (&ldquo;Our experience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has demonstrated not only that &lsquo;the office of the bill of particulars is fast becoming obsolete&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that in view of the adequate discovery procedure available under the Rules, motions for bills of particulars should be abolished altogether.&rdquo;); <em>Walling v. American Steamship Co</em>. (W.D.N.Y. 1945) 4 F.R.D. 355, 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.244, Case 8 (&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the adoption of the rule was ill advised. It has led to confusion, duplication and delay.&rdquo;) The tendency of some courts freely to grant extended bills of particulars has served to neutralize any helpful benefits derived from Rule 8, and has overlooked the intended use of the rules on depositions and discovery. The words &ldquo;or to prepare for trial&rdquo;&mdash;eliminated by the proposed amendment&mdash;have sometimes been seized upon as grounds for compulsory statement in the opposing pleading of all the details which the movant would have to meet at the trial. On the other hand, many courts have in effect read these words out of the rule. See <em>Walling v. Alabama Pipe Co</em>. (W.D.Mo. 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.244, Case 7; <em>Fleming v. Mason & Dixon Lines, Inc</em>. (E.D.Tenn. 1941) 42 F.Supp. 230; <em>Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co</em>. (D.N.J. 1941) 38 F.Supp. 643; <em>Brown v. H. L. Green Co</em>.

Jack</em> (D.Minn. 1945) 5 F.R.D. 1, 9 Fed.Rules Serv. 12e.244, Case 9. And it has been urged from the bench that the phrase be stricken. <em>Poole v.

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. This amendment affords a specific method of raising the insufficiency of a defense, a matter which has troubled some courts, although attack has been permitted in one way or another. See <em>Dysart v. Remington-Rand, Inc</em>. (D.Conn. 1939) 31 F.Supp. 296; <em>Eastman Kodak Co. v.

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. The change in title conforms with the companion provision in subdivision (h).</p>
<p class="note-body">The alteration of the &ldquo;except&rdquo; clause requires that other than provided in subdivision (h) a party who resorts to a motion to raise defenses specified in the rule, must include in one motion all that are then available to him. Under the original rule defenses which could be raised by motion were divided into two groups which could be the subjects of two successive motions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em>. The addition of the phrase relating to indispensable parties is one of necessity.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 4(e). See also the Advisory Committee's Note to amended Rule 4(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(7)</em>. The terminology of this subdivision is changed to accord with the amendment of Rule 19. See the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 19, as <!-- PDFPage:105 -->amended, especially the third paragraph therein before the caption &ldquo;Subdivision (c).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. Subdivision (g) has forbidden a defendant who makes a preanswer motion under this rule from making a further motion presenting any defense or objection which was available to him at the time he made the first motion and which he could have included, but did not in fact include therein. Thus if the defendant moves before answer to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, he is barred from making a further motion presenting the defense of improper venue, if that defense was available to him when he made his original motion. Amended subdivision (g) is to the same effect. This required consolidation of defenses and objections in a Rule 12 motion is salutary in that it works against piecemeal consideration of a case. For exceptions to the requirement of consolidation, see the last clause of subdivision (g), referring to new subdivision (h)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em>. The question has arisen whether an omitted defense which cannot be made the basis of a second motion may nevertheless be pleaded in the answer. Subdivision (h) called for waiver of &ldquo;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* defenses and objections which he [defendant] does not present *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* by motion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* or, if he has made no motion, in his answer *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; If the clause &ldquo;if he has made no motion,&rdquo; was read literally, it seemed that the omitted defense was waived and could not be pleaded in the answer. On the other hand, the clause might be read as adding nothing of substance to the preceding words; in that event it appeared that a defense was not waived by reason of being omitted from the motion and might be set up in the answer. The decisions were divided. Favoring waiver, see <em>Keefe v. Derounian</em>, 6 F.R.D. 11 (N.D.Ill. 1946); <em>Elbinger v. Precision Metal Workers Corp</em>., 18 F.R.D. 467 (E.D.Wis. 1956); see also <em>Rensing v. Turner Aviation Corp</em>., 166 F.Supp. 790 (N.D.Ill. 1958); <em>P. Beiersdorf & Co. v. Duke Laboratories, Inc</em>., 10 F.R.D. 282 (S.D.N.Y. 1950); <em>Neset v. Christensen</em>, 92 F.Supp. 78 (E.D.N.Y. 1950). Opposing waiver, see <em>Phillips v. Baker</em>, 121 F.2d 752 (9th Cir. 1941); <em>Crum v. Graham</em>, 32 F.R.D. 173 (D.Mont. 1963) (regretfully following the Phillips case); see also <em>Birnbaum v. Birrell</em>, 9 F.R.D. 72 (S.D.N.Y. 1948); <em>Johnson v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co</em>., 33 F.Supp. 176 (E.D.Tenn. 1940); cf. <em>Carter v. American Bus Lines, Inc</em>., 22 F.R.D. 323 (D.Neb. 1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended subdivision (h)(1)(A) eliminates the ambiguity and states that certain specified defenses which were available to a party when he made a preanswer motion, but which he omitted from the motion, are waived. The specified defenses are lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, and insufficiency of service of process (see Rule 12(b)(2)&ndash;(5)). A party who by motion invites the court to pass upon a threshold defense should bring forward all the specified defenses he then has and thus allow the court to do a reasonably complete job. The waiver reinforces the policy of subdivision (g) forbidding successive motions.</p>
<p class="note-body">By amended subdivision (h)(1)(B), the specified defenses, even if not waived by the operation of (A), are waived by the failure to raise them by a motion under Rule 12 or in the responsive pleading or any amendment thereof to which the party is entitled as a matter of course. The specified defenses are of such a character that they should not be delayed and brought up for the first time by means of an application to the court to amend the responsive pleading.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the language of the subdivisions is made clear, the party is put on fair notice of the effect of his actions and omissions and can guard himself against unintended waiver. It is to be noted that while the defenses specified in subdivision (h)(1) are subject to waiver as there provided, the more substantial defenses of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 19, and failure to state a legal defense to a claim (see Rule 12(b)(6), (7), (f)), as well as the defense of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter (see Rule 12(b)(1)), are expressly preserved against waiver by amended subdivision (h)(2) and (3).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is divided into paragraphs for greater clarity, and paragraph (1)(B) is added to reflect amendments to Rule 4. Consistent with Rule 4(d)(3), a defendant that timely waives service is allowed 60 days from the date the request was mailed in which to respond to the complaint, with an additional 30 days afforded if the request was sent out of the country. Service is timely waived if the waiver is returned within the time specified in the request (30 days after the request was mailed, or 60 days if mailed out of the country) and before being formally served with process. Sometimes a plaintiff may attempt to serve a defendant with process while also sending the defendant a request for waiver of service; if the defendant executes the waiver of service within the time specified and before being served with process, it should have the longer time to respond afforded by waiving service.</p>
<p class="note-body">The date of sending the request is to be inserted by the plaintiff on the face of the request for waiver and on the waiver itself. This date is used to measure the return day for the waiver form, so that the plaintiff can know on a day certain whether formal service of process will be necessary; it is also a useful date to measure the time for answer when service is waived. The defendant who returns the waiver is given additional time for answer in order to assure that it loses nothing by waiving service of process.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 13. Counterclaim and Cross-Claim</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compulsory Counterclaims</cap-smallcap>. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the pleader need not state the claim if (1) at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action, or (2) the opposing party brought suit upon the claim by attachment or other process by which the court did not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment on that claim, and the pleader is not stating any counterclaim under this Rule 13.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Permissive Counterclaims</cap-smallcap>. A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim</cap-smallcap>. A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Counterclaim Against the United States</cap-smallcap>. These rules shall not be construed to enlarge beyond the limits now fixed by law the right to assert counterclaims or to claim credits against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading</cap-smallcap>. A claim which either matured or was acquired by the pleader after serving a pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Omitted Counterclaim</cap-smallcap>. When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Cross-Claim Against Co-Party</cap-smallcap>. A pleading may state as a cross-claim any claim by one party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter either of the original action or of a counterclaim therein or relating to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. Such cross-claim may include a claim that the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Joinder of Additional Parties</cap-smallcap>. Persons other than those made parties to the original action may be made parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim in accordance with the provisions of Rules 19 and 20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Separate Trials; Separate Judgments</cap-smallcap>. If the court orders separate trials as provided in Rule 42(b), judgment on a counterclaim or cross-claim may be rendered in accordance with the terms of Rule 54(b) when the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party have been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. This is substantially [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), broadened to include legal as well as equitable counterclaims.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Compare the English practice, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 2 and 3, and O. 21, r.r. 10&mdash;17; <em>Beddall v. Maitland</em>, L.R. 17 Ch.Div. 174, 181, 182 (1881).</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Certain States have also adopted almost unrestricted provisions concerning both the subject matter of and the parties to a counterclaim. This seems to be the modern tendency. Ark.Civ.Code (Crawford, 1934) &sect;&sect;117 (as amended) and 118; N.J.Comp.Stat. (2 Cum.Supp. 1911&ndash;1924), N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;262, 266, 267 (all as amended, Laws of 1936, ch. 324), 268, 269, and 271; Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;263.14 (1)(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Most codes do not expressly provide for a counterclaim in the reply. Clark, <em>Code Pleading</em> (1928), p. 486. Ky.Codes (Carroll, 1932) Civ.Pract. &sect;98 does provide, however, for such counterclaim.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. The provisions of this rule respecting counterclaims are subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected). For a discussion of Federal jurisdiction and venue in regard to counterclaims and cross-claims, see Shulman and Jaegerman, <em>Some Jurisdictional Limitations in Federal Procedure</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 393, 410 et seq.</p>
<p class="note-body">6. This rule does not affect such statutes of the United States as U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;41(1) [now 1332, 1345, 1359] (United States as plaintiff; civil suits at common law and in equity), relating to assigned claims in actions based on diversity of citizenship.</p>
<p class="note-body">7. If the action proceeds to judgment without the interposition of a counterclaim as required by subdivision (a) of this rule, the counterclaim is barred. See <em>American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co</em>., 260 U.S. 360 (1922); <em>Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. National Electric Signalling Co</em>., 206 Fed. 295 (E.D.N.Y., 1913); Hopkins, <em>Federal Equity Rules</em> (8th ed., 1933), p. 213; Simkins, <em>Federal Practice</em> (1934), p. 663</p>
<p class="note-body">8. For allowance of credits against the United States see U.S.C., Title 26, &sect;&sect;1672&ndash;1673 [see 7442] (Suits for refunds of internal revenue taxes&mdash;limitations); U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;&sect;774 [now 2406] (Suits by United States against individuals; credits), [former] 775 (Suits under postal laws; credits); U.S.C., Title 31, &sect;227 [now 3728] (Offsets against judgments and claims against United States).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The use of the word &ldquo;filing&rdquo; was inadvertent. The word &ldquo;serving&rdquo; conforms with subdivision (<em>e</em>) and with usage generally throughout the rules.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:107 --><p class="note-body">The removal of the phrase &ldquo;not the subject of a pending action&rdquo; and the addition of the new clause at the end of the subdivision is designed to eliminate the ambiguity noted in <em>Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Saxe</em> (App.D.C. 1943) 134 F.(2d) 16, 33&ndash;34, cert. den. (1943) 319 U.S. 745. The rewording of the subdivision in this respect insures against an undesirable possibility presented under the original rule whereby a party having a claim which would be the subject of a compulsory counterclaim could avoid stating it as such by bringing an independent action in another court after the commencement of the federal action but before serving his pleading in the federal action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. The amendment is to care for a situation such as where a second mortgagee is made defendant in a foreclosure proceeding and wishes to file a cross-complaint against the mortgagor in order to secure a personal judgment for the indebtedness and foreclose his lien. A claim of this sort by the second mortgagee may not necessarily arise out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action under the terms of Rule 13(g).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em>. The change clarifies the interdependence of Rules 13(i) and 54(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">When a defendant, if he desires to defend his interest in property, is obliged to come in and litigate in a court to whose jurisdiction he could not ordinarily be subjected, fairness suggests that he should not be required to assert counterclaims, but should rather be permitted to do so at his election. If, however, he does elect to assert a counterclaim, it seems fair to require him to assert any other which is compulsory within the meaning of Rule 13(a). Clause (2), added by amendment to Rule 13(a), carries out this idea. It will apply to various cases described in Rule 4(e), as amended, where service is effected through attachment or other process by which the court does not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment against the defendant. Clause (2) will also apply to actions commenced in State courts jurisdictionally grounded on attachment or the like, and removed to the Federal courts.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 13(h), dealing with the joinder of additional parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim, has partaken of some of the textual difficulties of Rule 19 on necessary joinder of parties. See Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 19, as amended; cf. 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, Par. 13.39 (2d ed. 1963), and Supp. thereto; 1A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;399 (Wright ed. 1960). Rule 13(h) has also been inadequate in failing to call attention to the fact that a party pleading a counterclaim or cross-claim may join additional persons when the conditions for permissive joinder of parties under Rule 20 are satisfied.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of Rule 13(h) supplies the latter omission by expressly referring to Rule 20, as amended, and also incorporates by direct reference the revised criteria and procedures of Rule 19, as amended. Hereafter, for the purpose of determining who must or may be joined as additional parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim, the party pleading the claim is to be regarded as a plaintiff and the additional parties as plaintiffs or defendants as the case may be, and amended Rules 19 and 20 are to be applied in the usual fashion. See also Rules 13(a) (compulsory counterclaims) and 22 (interpleader).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of Rule 13(h), like the amendment of Rule 19, does not attempt to regulate Federal jurisdiction or venue. See Rule 82. It should be noted, however, that in some situations the decisional law has recognized &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; Federal jurisdiction over counterclaims and cross-claims and &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; venue as to parties to these claims.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>When Defendant May Bring in Third Party</cap-smallcap>. At any time after commencement of the action a defending party, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint to be served upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party plaintiff need not obtain leave to make the service if the third-party plaintiff files the third-party complaint not later than 10 days after serving the original answer. Otherwise the third-party plaintiff must obtain leave on motion upon notice to all parties to the action. The person served with the summons and third-party complaint, hereinafter called the third-party defendant, shall make any defenses to the third-party plaintiff's claim as provided in Rule 12 and any counterclaims against the third-party plaintiff and cross-claims against other third-party defendants as provided in Rule 13. The third-party defendant may assert against the plaintiff any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff's claim. The third-party defendant may also assert any claim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The plaintiff may assert any claim against the third-party defendant arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff, and the third-party defendant thereupon shall assert any defenses as provided in Rule 12 and any <!-- PDFPage:108 -->counterclaims and cross-claims as provided in Rule 13. Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, or for its severance or separate trial. A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule against any person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of the claim made in the action against the third-party defendant. The third-party complaint, if within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, may be in rem against a vessel, cargo, or other property subject to admiralty or maritime process in rem, in which case references in this rule to the summons include the warrant of arrest, and references to the third-party plaintiff or defendant include, where appropriate, the claimant of the property arrested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>When Plaintiff May Bring in Third Party</cap-smallcap>. When a counterclaim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may cause a third party to be brought in under circumstances which under this rule would entitle a defendant to do so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Admiralty and Maritime Claims</cap-smallcap>. When a plaintiff asserts an admiralty or maritime claim within the meaning of Rule 9(h), the defendant or claimant, as a third-party plaintiff, may bring in a third-party defendant who may be wholly or partly liable, either to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff, by way of remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on account of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences. In such a case the third-party plaintiff may also demand judgment against the third-party defendant in favor of the plaintiff, in which event the third-party defendant shall make any defenses to the claim of the plaintiff as well as to that of the third-party plaintiff in the manner provided in Rule 12 and the action shall proceed as if the plaintiff had commenced it against the third-party defendant as well as the third-party plaintiff.</p>

<p class="note-body">Third-party impleader is in some aspects a modern innovation in law and equity although well known in admiralty. Because of its many advantages a liberal procedure with respect to it has developed in England, in the Federal admiralty courts, and in some American State jurisdictions. See <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16A, r.r. 1&ndash;13; United States Supreme Court Admiralty Rules (1920), Rule 56 (Right to Bring in Party Jointly Liable); Pa.Stat.Ann. (Purdon, 1936) Title 12, &sect;141; Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;&sect;260.19, 260.20; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;193 (2), 211(a). Compare La.Code Pract. (Dart, 1932) &sect;&sect;378&ndash;388. For the practice in Texas as developed by judicial decision, see <em>Lottman v. Cuilla</em>, 288 S.W. 123, 126 (Tex., 1926). For a treatment of this subject see Gregory, <em>Legislative Loss Distribution in Negligence Actions</em> (1936); Shulman and Jaegerman, <em>Some Jurisdictional Limitations on Federal Procedure</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 393, 417, et seq.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third-party impleader under the conformity act has been applied in actions at law in the Federal courts. <em>Lowry and Co., Inc., v. National City Bank of New York</em>, 28 F.(2d) 895 (S.D.N.Y., 1928); <em>Yellow Cab Co. of Philadelphia v. Rodgers</em>, 61 F.(2d) 729 (C.C.A.3d, 1932).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The provisions in Rule 14(a) which relate to the impleading of a third party who is or may be liable to the plaintiff have been deleted by the proposed amendment. It has been held that under Rule 14(a) the plaintiff need not amend his complaint to state a claim against such third party if he does not wish to do so. <em>Satink v. Holland Township</em> (D.N.J. 1940) 31 F.Supp. 229, noted (1940) 88 U.Pa.L.Rev. 751; <em>Connelly v. Bender</em> (E.D.Mich. 1941) 36 F.Supp. 368; <em>Whitmire v. Partin v. Milton</em> (E.D.Tenn. 1941) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 14a.513, Case 2; <em>Crim v. Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co</em>. (D.D.C. 1939) 26 F.Supp. 715; <em>Carbola Chemical Co., Inc. v. Trundle</em> (S.D.N.Y. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Serv. 14a.224, Case 1; <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Providence Washington Ins. Co</em>. (N.D.Ohio 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 14a.513, Case 3. In <em>Delano v. Ives</em> (E.D.Pa. 1941) 40 F.Supp. 672, the court said: &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the weight of authority is to the effect that a defendant cannot compel the plaintiff, who has sued him, to sue also a third party whom he does not wish to sue, by tendering in a third party complaint the third party as an additional defendant directly liable to the plaintiff.&rdquo; Thus impleader here amounts to no more than a mere offer of a party to the plaintiff, and if he rejects it, the attempt is a time-consuming futility. See <em>Satink v. Holland Township, supra; Malkin v. Arundel Corp</em>. (D.Md. 1941) 36 F.Supp. 948; also Koenigsberger, <em>Suggestions for Changes in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, (1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 1010. But <em>cf. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co</em>. (M.D.Ga. 1943) 52 F.Supp. 177. Moreover, in any case where the plaintiff could not have joined the third party originally because of jurisdictional limitations such as lack of diversity of citizenship, the majority view is that any attempt by the plaintiff to amend his complaint and assert a claim against the impleaded third party would be unavailing. <em>Hoskie v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Lorrac Real Estate Corp</em>. (E.D.N.Y. 1941) 39 F.Supp. 305; <em>Johnson v. G. J. Sherrard Co. v. New England Telephone & Telegraph Co</em>.

Discussion of the problem will be found in Commentary, <em>Amendment of Plaintiff's Pleading to Assert Claim Against Third-Party Defendant</em> (1942) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 811; Commentary, <em>Federal Jurisdiction in Third-Party Practice</em> (1943) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 766; Holtzoff, <em>Some Problems Under Federal Third-Party Practice</em> (1941) 3 La.L.Rev. 408, 419&ndash;420; 1. <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) Cum.Supplement &sect;14.08. For these reasons therefore, the words &ldquo;or to the plaintiff&rdquo; in the first sentence of subdivision (a) have been removed by the amendment; and in conformance therewith the words &ldquo;the plaintiff&rdquo; in the second sentence of the subdivision, and the words &ldquo;or to the third-party plaintiff&rdquo; in the concluding sentence thereof have likewise been eliminated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third sentence of Rule 14(a) has been expanded to clarify the right of the third-party defendant to assert any defenses which the third-party plaintiff may have to the plaintiff's claim. This protects the impleaded third-party defendant where the third-party plaintiff fails or neglects to assert a proper defense to the plaintiff's action. A new sentence has also been inserted giving the third-party defendant the right to assert directly against the original plaintiff any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party <!-- PDFPage:109 -->plaintiff. This permits all claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence to be heard and determined in the same action. See <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co</em>. (M.D.Ga. 1943) 52 F.Supp. 177. Accordingly, the next to the last sentence of subdivision (a) has also been revised to make clear that the plaintiff may, if he desires, assert directly against the third-party defendant either by amendment or by a new pleading any claim he may have against him arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. In such a case, the third-party defendant then is entitled to assert the defenses, counterclaims and cross-claims provided in Rules 12 and 13.</p>
<p class="note-body">The sentence reading &ldquo;The third-party defendant is bound by the adjudication of the third-party plaintiff's liability to the plaintiff, as well as of his own to the plaintiff, or to the third-party plaintiff&rdquo; has been stricken from Rule 14(a), not to change the law, but because the sentence states a rule of substantive law which is not within the scope of a procedural rule. It is not the purpose of the rules to state the effect of a judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The elimination of the words &ldquo;the third-party plaintiff, or any other party&rdquo; from the second sentence of Rule 14(a), together with the insertion of the new phrases therein, are not changes of substance but are merely for the purpose of clarification.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment of the initial sentences of the subdivision, a defendant as a third-party plaintiff may freely and without leave of court bring in a third-party defendant if he files the third-party complaint not later than 10 days after he serves his original answer. When the impleader comes so early in the case, there is little value in requiring a preliminary ruling by the court on the propriety of the impleader.</p>
<p class="note-body">After the third-party defendant is brought in, the court has discretion to strike the third-party claim if it is obviously unmeritorious and can only delay or prejudice the disposition of the plaintiff's claim, or to sever the third-party claim or accord it separate trial if confusion or prejudice would otherwise result. This discretion, applicable not merely to the cases covered by the amendment where the third-party defendant is brought in without leave, but to all impleaders under the rule, is emphasized in the next-to-last sentence of the subdivision, added by amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">In dispensing with leave of court for an impleader filed not later than 10 days after serving the answer, but retaining the leave requirement for impleaders sought to be effected thereafter, the amended subdivision takes a moderate position on the lines urged by some commentators, see Note, 43 Minn.L.Rev. 115 (1958); cf. Pa.R.Civ.P. 2252&ndash;53 (60 days after service on the defendant); Minn.R.Civ.P. 14.01 (45 days). Other commentators would dispense with the requirement of leave regardless of the time when impleader is effected, and would rely on subsequent action by the court to dismiss the impleader if it would unduly delay or complicate the litigation or would be otherwise objectionable. See 1A Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice & Procedure 649&ndash;50 (Wright ed. 1960); Comment, 58 Colum.L.Rev. 532, 546 (1958); cf. N.Y.Civ.Prac. Act &sect;193&ndash;a; Me.R.Civ.P. 14. The amended subdivision preserves the value of a preliminary screening, through the leave procedure, of impleaders attempted after the 10-day period.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment applies also when an impleader is initiated by a third-party defendant against a person who may be liable to him, as provided in the last sentence of the subdivision.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 14 was modeled on Admiralty Rule 56. An important feature of Admiralty Rule 56 was that it allowed impleader not only of a person who might be liable to the defendant by way of remedy over, but also of any person who might be liable to the plaintiff. The importance of this provision was that the defendant was entitled to insist that the plaintiff proceed to judgment against the third-party defendant. In certain cases this was a valuable implementation of a substantive right. For example, in a case of ship collision where a finding of mutual fault is possible, one ship- owner, if sued alone, faces the prospect of an absolute judgment for the full amount of the damage suffered by an innocent third party; but if he can implead the owner of the other vessel, and if mutual fault is found, the judgment against the original defendant will be in the first instance only for a moiety of the damages; liability for the remainder will be conditioned on the plaintiff's inability to collect from the third-party defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">This feature was originally incorporated in Rule 14, but was eliminated by the amendment of 1946, so that under the amended rule a third party could not be impleaded on the basis that he might be liable to the plaintiff. One of the reasons for the amendment was that the Civil Rule, unlike the Admiralty Rule, did not require the plaintiff to go to judgment against the third-party defendant. Another reason was that where jurisdiction depended on diversity of citizenship the impleader of an adversary having the same citizenship as the plaintiff was not considered possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Retention of the admiralty practice in those cases that will be counterparts of a suit in admiralty is clearly desirable.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Amendments</cap-smallcap>. A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within 10 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Amendments To Conform to the Evidence</cap-smallcap>. When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such <!-- PDFPage:110 -->amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice the party in maintaining the party's action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Relation Back of Amendments</cap-smallcap>. An amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for service of the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The delivery or mailing of process to the United States Attorney, or United States Attorney's designee, or the Attorney General of the United States, or an agency or officer who would have been a proper defendant if named, satisfies the requirement of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (3) with respect to the United States or any agency or officer thereof to be brought into the action as a defendant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Supplemental Pleadings</cap-smallcap>. Upon motion of a party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit the party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense. If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 15(d) is intended to give the court broad discretion in allowing a supplemental pleading. However, some cases, opposed by other cases and criticized by the commentators, have taken the rigid and formalistic view that where the original complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, leave to serve a supplemental complaint must be denied. See <em>Bonner v. Elizabeth Arden, Inc</em>., 177 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1949); <em>Bowles v. Senderowitz</em>, 65 F.Supp. 548 (E.D.Pa.), rev'd on other grounds, 158 F.2d 435 (3d Cir. 1946), cert. denied, <em>Senderowitz v. Fleming</em>, 330 U.S. 848, 67 S.Ct. 1091, 91 L.Ed. 1292 (1947); cf. <em>LaSalle Nat. Bank v. 222 East Chestnut St. Corp</em>., 267 F.2d 247 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 836, 80 S.Ct. 88, 4 L.Ed.2d 77 (1959). But see <em>Camilla Cotton Oil Co. v. Spencer Kellogg & Sons</em>, 257 F.2d 162 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Genuth v. National Biscuit Co</em>., 81 F.Supp. 213 (S.D.N.Y. 1948), app. dism., 177 F.2d 962 (2d Cir. 1949); 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;15.01 [5] (Supp. 1960); 1A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> 820&ndash;21 (Wright ed. 1960). Thus plaintiffs have sometimes been needlessly remitted to the difficulties of commencing a new action even though events occurring after the commencement of the original action have made clear the right to relief.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment the court has discretion to permit a supplemental pleading despite the fact that the original pleading is defective. As in other situations where a supplemental pleading is offered, the court is to determine in the light of the particular circumstances whether filing should be permitted, and if so, upon what terms. The amendment does not attempt to deal with such questions as the relation of the statute of limitations to supplemental pleadings, the operation of the doctrine of laches, or the availability of other defenses. All these questions are for decision in accordance with the principles applicable to supplemental pleadings generally. Cf. <em>Blau v. Lamb</em>, 191 F.Supp. 906 (S.D.N.Y. 1961); <em>Lendonsol Amusement Corp. <!-- PDFPage:111 -->v. B. & Q. Assoc., Inc</em>., 23 F.R.Serv. 15d. 3, Case 1 (D.Mass. 1957).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 15(c) is amplified to state more clearly when an amendment of a pleading changing the party against whom a claim is asserted (including an amendment to correct a misnomer or misdescription of a defendant) shall &ldquo;relate back&rdquo; to the date of the original pleading.</p>
<p class="note-body">The problem has arisen most acutely in certain actions by private parties against officers or agencies of the United States. Thus an individual denied social security benefits by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may secure review of the decision by bringing a civil action against that officer within sixty days. 42 U.S.C. &sect;405(g) (Supp. III, 1962). In several recent cases the claimants instituted timely action but mistakenly named as defendant the United States, the Department of HEW, the &ldquo;Federal Security Administration&rdquo; (a nonexistent agency), and a Secretary who had retired from the office nineteen days before. Discovering their mistakes, the claimants moved to amend their complaints to name the proper defendant; by this time the statutory sixty-day period had expired. The motions were denied on the ground that the amendment &ldquo;would amount to the commencement of a new proceeding and would not relate back in time so as to avoid the statutory provision *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that suit be brought within sixty days *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; <em>Cohn v. Federal Security Adm</em>., 199 F.Supp. 884, 885 (W.D.N.Y. 1961); see also <em>Cunningham v. United States</em>, 199 F.Supp. 541 (W.D.Mo. 1958); <em>Hall v. Department of HEW</em>, 199 F.Supp. 833 (S.D.Tex. 1960); <em>Sandridge v. Folsom, Secretary of HEW</em>, 200 F.Supp. 25 (M.D.Tenn. 1959). [The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare has approved certain ameliorative regulations under 42 U.S.C. &sect;405(g). See 29 Fed.Reg. 8209 (June 30, 1964); Jacoby, The Effect of Recent Changes in the Law of &ldquo;Nonstatutory&rdquo; Judicial Review, 53 Geo.L.J. 19, 42&ndash;43 (1964); see also <em>Simmons v. United States Dept. HEW</em>, 328 F.2d 86 (3d Cir. 1964).]</p>
<p class="note-body">Analysis in terms of &ldquo;new proceeding&rdquo; is traceable to <em>Davis v. L. L. Cohen & Co</em>., 268 U.S. 638 (1925), and <em>Mellon v. Arkansas Land & Lumber Co</em>., 275 U.S. 460 (1928), but those cases antedate the adoption of the Rules which import different criteria for determining when an amendment is to &ldquo;relate back&rdquo;. As lower courts have continued to rely on the <em>Davis</em> and <em>Mellon</em> cases despite the contrary intent of the Rules, clarification of Rule 15(c) is considered advisable.</p>
<p class="note-body">Relation back is intimately connected with the policy of the statute of limitations. The policy of the statute limiting the time for suit against the Secretary of HEW would not have been offended by allowing relation back in the situations described above. For the government was put on notice of the claim within the stated period&mdash;in the particular instances, by means of the initial delivery of process to a responsible government official (see Rule 4(d)(4) and (5). In these circumstances, characterization of the amendment as a new proceeding is not responsive to the realty, but is merely question-begging; and to deny relation back is to defeat unjustly the claimant's opportunity to prove his case. See the full discussion by Byse, <em>Suing the &ldquo;Wrong&rdquo; Defendant in Judicial Review of Federal Administrative Action: Proposals for Reform</em>, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 40 (1963); see also Ill.Civ.P.Act &sect;46(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Much the same question arises in other types of actions against the government (see <em>Byse</em>, supra, at 45 n. 15). In actions between private parties, the problem of relation back of amendments changing defendants has generally been better handled by the courts, but incorrect criteria have sometimes been applied, leading sporadically to doubtful results. See 1A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;451 (Wright ed. 1960); 1 id. &sect;186 (1960); 2 id. &sect;543 (1961); 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, par. 15.15 (Cum.Supp. 1962); Annot., <em>Change in Party After Statute of Limitations Has Run</em>, 8 A.L.R.2d 6 (1949). Rule 15(c) has been amplified to provide a general solution. An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the amendment satisfies the usual condition of Rule 15(c) of &ldquo;arising out of the conduct *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* set forth *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* in the original pleading,&rdquo; and if, within the applicable limitations period, the party brought in by amendment, first, received such notice of the institution of the action&mdash;the notice need not be formal&mdash;that he would not be prejudiced in defending the action, and, second, knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against him initially had there not been a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party. Revised Rule 15(c) goes on to provide specifically in the government cases that the first and second requirements are satisfied when the government has been notified in the manner there described (see Rule 4(d)(4) and (5). As applied to the government cases, revised Rule 15(c) further advances the objectives of the 1961 amendment of Rule 25(d) (substitution of public officers).</p>
<p class="note-body">The relation back of amendments changing plaintiffs is not expressly treated in revised Rule 15(c) since the problem is generally easier. Again the chief consideration of policy is that of the statute of limitations, and the attitude taken in revised Rule 15(c) toward change of defendants extends by analogy to amendments changing plaintiffs. Also relevant is the amendment of Rule 17(a) (real party in interest). To avoid forfeitures of just claims, revised Rule 17(a) would provide that no action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed for correction of the defect in the manner there stated.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule has been revised to prevent parties against whom claims are made from taking unjust advantage of otherwise inconsequential pleading errors to sustain a limitations defense.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (c)(1)</em>. This provision is new. It is intended to make it clear that the rule does not apply to preclude any relation back that may be permitted under the applicable limitations law. Generally, the applicable limitations law will be state law. If federal jurisdiction is based on the citizenship of the parties, the primary reference is the law of the state in which the district court sits. <em>Walker v. Armco Steel Corp</em>., 446 U.S. 740 (1980). If federal jurisdiction is based on a federal question, the reference may be to the law of the state governing relations between the parties. <em>E.g., Board of Regents v. Tomanio</em>, 446 U.S. 478 (1980). In some circumstances, the controlling limitations law may be federal law. <em>E.g., West v. Conrail, Inc</em>., 107 S.Ct. 1538 (1987). Cf. <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods</em>, 480 U.S. 1 (1987); <em>Stewart Organization v. Ricoh</em>, 108 S.Ct. 2239 (1988). Whatever may be the controlling body of limitations law, if that law affords a more forgiving principle of relation back than the one provided in this rule, it should be available to save the claim. Accord, <em>Marshall v. Mulrenin</em>, 508 F.2d 39 (1st cir. 1974). If <em>Schiavone v. Fortune</em>, 106 S.Ct. 2379 (1986) implies the contrary, this paragraph is intended to make a material change in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (c)(3)</em>. This paragraph has been revised to change the result in <em>Schiavone v. Fortune, supra</em>, with respect to the problem of a misnamed defendant. An intended defendant who is notified of an action within the period allowed by Rule 4(m) for service of a summons and complaint may not under the revised rule defeat the action on account of a defect in the pleading with respect to the defendant's name, provided that the requirements of clauses (A) and (B) have been met. If the notice requirement is met within the Rule 4(m) period, a complaint may be amended at any time to correct a formal defect such as a misnomer or misidentifi<!-- PDFPage:112 -->cation. On the basis of the text of the former rule, the Court reached a result in <em>Schiavone v. Fortune</em> that was inconsistent with the liberal pleading practices secured by Rule 8. See Bauer, Schiavone: <em>An Un-Fortune-ate Illustration of the Supreme Court's Role as Interpreter of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, 63 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 720 (1988); Brussack, <em>Outrageous Fortune: The Case for Amending Rule 15(c) Again</em>, 61 S. CAL. L. REV. 671 (1988); Lewis, <em>The Excessive History of Federal Rule 15(c) and Its Lessons for Civil Rules Revision</em>, 86 MICH. L. REV. 1507 (1987).</p>

<!-- field-end:amendment-note -->
<!-- field-end:notes -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Introduction</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 16 has not been amended since the Federal Rules were promulgated in 1938. In many respects, the rule has been a success. For example, there is evidence that pretrial conferences may improve the quality of justice rendered in the federal courts by sharpening the preparation and presentation of cases, tending to eliminate trial surprise, and improving, as well as facilitating, the settlement process. See 6 Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;1522 (1971). However, in other respects particularly with regard to case management, the rule has not always been as helpful as it might have been. Thus there has been a widespread feeling that amendment is necessary to encourage pretrial management that meets the needs of modern litigation. See <em>Report of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures</em> (1979).</p>
<p class="note-body">Major criticism of Rule 16 has centered on the fact that its application can result in over-regulation of some cases and under-regulation of others. In simple, run-of-the-mill cases, attorneys have found pretrial requirements burdensome. It is claimed that over-administration leads to a series of mini-trials that result in a waste of an attorney's time and needless expense to a client. Pollack, <em>Pretrial Procedures More Effectively Handled</em>, 65 F.R.D. 475 (1974). This is especially likely to be true when pretrial proceedings occur long before trial. At the other end of the spectrum, the discretionary character of Rule 16 and its orientation toward a single conference late in the pretrial process has led to under-administration of complex or protracted cases. Without judicial guidance beginning shortly after institution, these cases often become mired in discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">Four sources of criticism of pretrial have been identified. First, conferences often are seen as a mere exchange of legalistic contentions without any real analysis of the particular case. Second, the result frequently is nothing but a formal agreement on minutiae. Third, the conferences are seen as unnecessary and time-consuming in cases that will be settled before trial. Fourth, the meetings can be ceremonial and ritualistic, having little effect on the trial and being of minimal value, particularly when the attorneys attending the sessions are not the ones who will try the case or lack authority to enter into binding stipulations. See generally <em>McCargo v. Hedrick</em>, 545 F.2d 393 (4th Cir. <!-- PDFPage:114 -->1976); Pollack, <em>Pretrial Procedures More Effectively Handled</em>, 65 F.R.D. 475 (1974); Rosenberg, <em>The Pretrial Conference and Effective Justice</em> 45 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">There also have been difficulties with the pretrial orders that issue following Rule 16 conferences. When an order is entered far in advance of trial, some issues may not be properly formulated. Counsel naturally are cautious and often try to preserve as many options as possible. If the judge who tries the case did not conduct the conference, he could find it difficult to determine exactly what was agreed to at the conference. But any insistence on a detailed order may be too burdensome, depending on the nature or posture of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Given the significant changes in federal civil litigation since 1938 that are not reflected in Rule 16, it has been extensively rewritten and expanded to meet the challenges of modern litigation. Empirical studies reveal that when a trial judge intervenes personally at an early stage to assume judicial control over a case and to schedule dates for completion by the parties of the principal pretrial steps, the case is disposed of by settlement or trial more efficiently and with less cost and delay than when the parties are left to their own devices. Flanders, <em>Case Management and Court Management in United States District Courts</em> 17, Federal Judicial Center (1977). Thus, the rule mandates a pretrial scheduling order. However, although scheduling and pretrial conferences are encouraged in appropriate cases, they are not mandated.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Discussion</em></h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a); Pretrial Conferences; Objectives</em>. The amended rule makes scheduling and case management an express goal of pretrial procedure. This is done in Rule 16(a) by shifting the emphasis away from a conference focused solely on the trial and toward a process of judicial management that embraces the entire pretrial phase, especially motions and discovery. In addition, the amendment explicitly recognizes some of the objectives of pretrial conferences and the powers that many courts already have assumed. Rule 16 thus will be a more accurate reflection of actual practice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b); Scheduling and Planning</em>. The most significant change in Rule 16 is the mandatory scheduling order described in Rule 16(b), which is based in part on Wisconsin Civil Procedure Rule 802.10. The idea of scheduling orders is not new. It has been used by many federal courts. See, <em>e.g</em>., Southern District of Indiana, Local Rule 19.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although a mandatory scheduling order encourages the court to become involved in case management early in the litigation, it represents a degree of judicial involvement that is not warranted in many cases. Thus, subdivision (b) permits each district court to promulgate a local rule under Rule 83 exempting certain categories of cases in which the burdens of scheduling orders exceed the administrative efficiencies that would be gained. See Eastern District of Virginia, Local Rule 12(1). Logical candidates for this treatment include social security disability matters, habeas corpus petitions, forfeitures, and reviews of certain administrative actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">A scheduling conference may be requested either by the judge, a magistrate when authorized by district court rule, or a party within 120 days after the summons and complaint are filed. If a scheduling conference is not arranged within that time and the case is not exempted by local rule, a scheduling order must be issued under Rule 16(b), after some communication with the parties, which may be by telephone or mail rather than in person. The use of the term &ldquo;judge&rdquo; in subdivision (b) reflects the Advisory Committee's judgment that is it preferable that this task should be handled by a district judge rather than a magistrate, except when the magistrate is acting under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c). While personal supervision by the trial judge is preferred, the rule, in recognition of the impracticality or difficulty of complying with such a requirement in some districts, authorizes a district by local rule to delegate the duties to a magistrate. In order to formulate a practicable scheduling order, the judge, or a magistrate when authorized by district court rule, and attorneys are required to develop a timetable for the matters listed in Rule 16(b)(1)&ndash;(3). As indicated in Rule 16(b)(4)&ndash;(5), the order may also deal with a wide range of other matters. The rule is phrased permissively as to clauses (4) and (5), however, because scheduling these items at an early point may not be feasible or appropriate. Even though subdivision (b) relates only to scheduling, there is no reason why some of the procedural matters listed in Rule 16(c) cannot be addressed at the same time, at least when a scheduling conference is held.</p>
<p class="note-body">Item (1) assures that at some point both the parties and the pleadings will be fixed, by setting a time within which joinder of parties shall be completed and the pleadings amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">Item (2) requires setting time limits for interposing various motions that otherwise might be used as stalling techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body">Item (3) deals with the problem of procrastination and delay by attorneys in a context in which scheduling is especially important&mdash;discovery. Scheduling the completion of discovery can serve some of the same functions as the conference described in Rule 26(f).</p>
<p class="note-body">Item (4) refers to setting dates for conferences and for trial. Scheduling multiple pretrial conferences may well be desirable if the case is complex and the court believes that a more elaborate pretrial structure, such as that described in the <em>Manual for Complex Litigation</em>, should be employed. On the other hand, only one pretrial conference may be necessary in an uncomplicated case.</p>
<p class="note-body">As long as the case is not exempted by local rule, the court must issue a written scheduling order even if no scheduling conference is called. The order, like pretrial orders under the former rule and those under new Rule 16(c), normally will &ldquo;control the subsequent course of the action.&rdquo; See Rule 16(e). After consultation with the attorneys for the parties and any unrepresented parties&mdash;a formal motion is not necessary&mdash;the court may modify the schedule on a showing of good cause if it cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension. Since the scheduling order is entered early in the litigation, this standard seems more appropriate than a &ldquo;manifest injustice&rdquo; or &ldquo;substantial hardship&rdquo; test. Otherwise, a fear that extensions will not be granted may encourage counsel to request the longest possible periods for completing pleading, joinder, and discovery. Moreover, changes in the court's calendar sometimes will oblige the judge or magistrate when authorized by district court rule to modify the scheduling order.</p>
<p class="note-body">The district courts undoubtedly will develop several prototype scheduling orders for different types of cases. In addition, when no formal conference is held, the court may obtain scheduling information by telephone, mail, or otherwise. In many instances this will result in a scheduling order better suited to the individual case than a standard order, without taking the time that would be required by a formal conference.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 16(b) assures that the judge will take some early control over the litigation, even when its character does not warrant holding a scheduling conference. Despite the fact that the process of preparing a scheduling order does not always bring the attorneys and judge together, the fixing of time limits serves</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;to stimulate litigants to narrow the areas of inquiry and advocacy to those they believe are truly relevant and material. Time limits not only compress the amount of time for litigation, they should also reduce the amount of resources invested in litigation. Litigants are forced to establish discovery priorities and thus to do the most important work first.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>Report of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures</em> 28 (1979).</p>
<p class="note-body">Thus, except in exempted cases, the judge or a magistrate when authorized by district court rule will have taken some action in every case within 120 days after <!-- PDFPage:115 -->the complaint is filed that notifies the attorneys that the case <em>will</em> be moving toward trial. Subdivision (b) is reenforced by subdivision (f), which makes it clear that the sanctions for violating a scheduling order are the same as those for violating a pretrial order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c); Subjects to be Discussed at Pretrial Conferences</em>. This subdivision expands upon the list of things that may be discussed at a pretrial conference that appeared in original Rule 16. The intention is to encourage better planning and management of litigation. Increased judicial control during the pretrial process accelerates the processing and termination of cases. Flanders, <em>Case Management and Court Management in United States District Courts</em>, Federal Judicial Center (1977). See also <em>Report of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures</em> (1979).</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference in Rule 16(c)(1) to &ldquo;formulation&rdquo; is intended to clarify and confirm the court's power to identify the litigable issues. It has been added in the hope of promoting efficiency and conserving judicial resources by identifying the real issues prior to trial, thereby saving time and expense for everyone. See generally <em>Meadow Gold Prods. Co. v. Wright</em>, 278 F.2d 867 (D.C. Cir. 1960). The notion is emphasized by expressly authorizing the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses at a pretrial conference. There is no reason to require that this await a formal motion for summary judgment. Nor is there any reason for the court to wait for the parties to initiate the process called for in Rule 16(c)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">The timing of any attempt at issue formulation is a matter of judicial discretion. In relatively simple cases it may not be necessary or may take the form of a stipulation between counsel or a request by the court that counsel work together to draft a proposed order.</p>
<p class="note-body">Counsel bear a substantial responsibility for assisting the court in identifying the factual issues worthy of trial. If counsel fail to identify an issue for the court, the right to have the issue tried is waived. Although an order specifying the issues is intended to be binding, it may be amended at trial to avoid manifest injustice. See Rule 16(e). However, the rule's effectiveness depends on the court employing its discretion sparingly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (6) acknowledges the widespread availability and use of magistrates. The corresponding provision in the original rule referred only to masters and limited the function of the reference to the making of &ldquo;findings to be used as evidence&rdquo; in a case to be tried to a jury. The new text is not limited and broadens the potential use of a magistrate to that permitted by the Magistrate's Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (7) explicitly recognizes that it has become commonplace to discuss settlement at pretrial conferences. Since it obviously eases crowded court dockets and results in savings to the litigants and the judicial system, settlement should be facilitated at as early a stage of the litigation as possible. Although it is not the purpose of Rule 16(b)(7) to impose settlement negotiations on unwilling litigants, it is believed that providing a neutral forum for discussing the subject might foster it. See Moore's <em>Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;16.17; 6 Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;1522 (1971). For instance, a judge to whom a case has been assigned may arrange, on his own motion or a at a party's request, to have settlement conferences handled by another member of the court or by a magistrate. The rule does not make settlement conferences mandatory because they would be a waste of time in many cases. See Flanders, <em>Case Management and Court Management in the United States District Courts</em>, 39, Federal Judicial Center (1977). Requests for a conference from a party indicating a willingness to talk settlement normally should be honored, unless thought to be frivolous or dilatory.</p>
<p class="note-body">A settlement conference is appropriate at any time. It may be held in conjunction with a pretrial or discovery conference, although various objectives of pretrial management, such as moving the case toward trial, may not always be compatible with settlement negotiations, and thus a separate settlement conference may be desirable. See 6 Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;1522, at p. 751 (1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to settlement, Rule 16(c)(7) refers to exploring the use of procedures other than litigation to resolve the dispute. This includes urging the litigants to employ adjudicatory techniques outside the courthouse. See, for example, the experiment described in Green, Marks & Olson, <em>Settling Large Case Litigation: An Alternative Approach</em>, 11 Loyola of L.A. L.Rev. 493 (1978).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 16(c)(10) authorizes the use of special pretrial procedures to expedite the adjudication of potentially difficult or protracted cases. Some district courts obviously have done so for many years. See Rubin, <em>The Managed Calendar: Some Pragmatic Suggestions About Achieving the Just, Speedy and Inexpensive Determination of Civil Cases in Federal Courts</em>, 4 Just. Sys. J. 135 (1976). Clause 10 provides an explicit authorization for such procedures and encourages their use. No particular techniques have been described; the Committee felt that flexibility and experience are the keys to efficient management of complex cases. Extensive guidance is offered in such documents as the <em>Manual for Complex Litigation.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">The rule simply identifies characteristics that make a case a strong candidate for special treatment. The four mentioned are illustrative, not exhaustive, and overlap to some degree. But experience has shown that one or more of them will be present in every protracted or difficult case and it seems desirable to set them out. See Kendig, <em>Procedures for Management of Non-Routine Cases</em>, 3 Hofstra L.Rev. 701 (1975).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (c) is new. See Wisconsin Civil Procedure Rule 802.11(2). It has been added to meet one of the criticisms of the present practice described earlier and insure proper preconference preparation so that the meeting is more than a ceremonial or ritualistic event. The reference to &ldquo;authority&rdquo; is not intended to insist upon the ability to settle the litigation. Nor should the rule be read to encourage the judge conducting the conference to compel attorneys to enter into stipulations or to make admissions that they consider to be unreasonable, that touch on matters that could not normally have been anticipated to arise at the conference, or on subjects of a dimension that normally require prior consultation with and approval from the client.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d); Final Pretrial Conference</em>. This provision has been added to make it clear that the time between any final pretrial conference (which in a simple case may be the <em>only</em> pretrial conference) and trail should be as short as possible to be certain that the litigants make substantial progress with the case and avoid the inefficiency of having that preparation repeated when there is a delay between the last pretrial conference and trial. An optimum time of 10 days to two weeks has been suggested by one federal judge. Rubin, <em>The Managed Calendar: Some Pragmatic Suggestions About Achieving the Just, Speedy and Inexpensive Determination of Civil Cases in Federal Courts</em>, 4 Just. Sys. J. 135, 141 (1976). The Committee, however, concluded that it would be inappropriate to fix a precise time in the rule, given the numerous variables that could bear on the matter. Thus the timing has been left to the court's discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">At least one of the attorneys who will conduct the trial for each party must be present at the final pretrial conference. At this late date there should be no doubt as to which attorney or attorneys this will be. Since the agreements and stipulations made at this final conference will control the trial, the presence of lawyers who will be involved in it is especially useful to assist the judge in structuring the case, and to lead to a more effective trial.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e); Pretrial Orders</em>. Rule 16(e) does not substantially change the portion of the original rule dealing with pretrial orders. The purpose of an order is to guide the course of the litigation and the language of the original rule making that clear has been retained. No compelling reason has been found for major revision, especially since this portion of the rule has been <!-- PDFPage:116 -->interpreted and clarified by over forty years of judicial decisions with comparatively little difficulty. See 6 Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;&sect;1521&ndash;30 (1971). Changes in language therefore have been kept to a minimum to avoid confusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the amended rule encourages more extensive pretrial management than did the original, two or more conferences may be held in many cases. The language of Rule 16(e) recognizes this possibility and the corresponding need to issue more than one pretrial order in a single case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Once formulated, pretrial orders should not be changed lightly; but total inflexibility is undesirable. See, <em>e.g., Clark v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co</em>., 328 F.2d 591 (2d Cir. 1964). The exact words used to describe the standard for amending the pretrial order probably are less important than the meaning given them in practice. By not imposing any limitation on the ability to modify a pretrial order, the rule reflects the reality that in any process of continuous management what is done at one conference may have to be altered at the next. In the case of the final pretrial order, however, a more stringent standard is called for and the words &ldquo;to prevent manifest injustice,&rdquo; which appeared in the original rule, have been retained. They have the virtue of familiarity and adequately describe the restraint the trial judge should exercise.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many local rules make the plaintiff's attorney responsible for drafting a proposed pretrial order, either before or after the conference. Others allow the court to appoint any of the attorneys to perform the task, and others leave it to the court. See Note, <em>Pretrial Conference: A Critical Examination of Local Rules Adopted by Federal District Courts</em>, 64 Va.L.Rev. 467 (1978). Rule 16 has never addressed this matter. Since there is no consensus about which method of drafting the order works best and there is no reason to believe that nationwide uniformity is needed, the rule has been left silent on the point. See <em>Handbook for Effective Pretrial Procedure</em>, 37 F.R.D. 225 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f); Sanctions</em>. Original Rule 16 did not mention the sanctions that might be imposed for failing to comply with the rule. However, courts have not hesitated to enforce it by appropriate measures. See, <em>e.g., Link v. Wabash R. Co</em>., 370 U.S. 628 (1962) (district court's dismissal under Rule 41(b) after plaintiff's attorney failed to appear at a pretrial conference upheld); <em>Admiral Theatre Corp. v. Douglas Theatre</em>, 585 F.2d 877 (8th Cir. 1978) (district court has discretion to exclude exhibits or refuse to permit the testimony of a witness not listed prior to trial in contravention of its pretrial order).</p>
<p class="note-body">To reflect that existing practice, and to obviate dependence upon Rule 41(b) or the court's inherent power to regulate litigation, <em>cf. Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197 (1958), Rule 16(f) expressly provides for imposing sanctions on disobedient or recalcitrant parties, their attorneys, or both in four types of situations. Rodes, Ripple & Mooney, <em>Sanctions Imposable for Violations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em> 65&ndash;67, 80&ndash;84, Federal Judicial Center (1981). Furthermore, explicit reference to sanctions reenforces the rule's intention to encourage forceful judicial management.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 16(f) incorporates portions of Rule 37(b)(2), which prescribes sanctions for failing to make discovery. This should facilitate application of Rule 16(f), since courts and lawyers already are familiar with the Rule 37 standards. Among the sanctions authorized by the new subdivision are: preclusion order, striking a pleading, staying the proceeding, default judgment, contempt, and charging a party, his attorney, or both with the expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by noncompliance. The contempt sanction, however, is only available for a violation of a court order. The references in Rule 16(f) are not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="note-body">As is true under Rule 37(b)(2), the imposition of sanctions may be sought by either the court or a party. In addition, the court has discretion to impose whichever sanction it feels is appropriate under the circumstances. Its action is reviewable under the abuse-of-discretion standard. See <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc</em>., 427 U.S. 639 (1976).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. One purpose of this amendment is to provide a more appropriate deadline for the initial scheduling order required by the rule. The former rule directed that the order be entered within 120 days from the filing of the complaint. This requirement has created problems because Rule 4(m) allows 120 days for service and ordinarily at least one defendant should be available to participate in the process of formulating the scheduling order. The revision provides that the order is to be entered within 90 days after the date a defendant first appears (whether by answer or by a motion under Rule 12) or, if earlier (as may occur in some actions against the United States or if service is waived under Rule 4), within 120 days after service of the complaint on a defendant. The longer time provided by the revision is not intended to encourage unnecessary delays in entering the scheduling order. Indeed, in most cases the order can and should be entered at a much earlier date. Rather, the additional time is intended to alleviate problems in multi-defendant cases and should ordinarily be adequate to enable participation by all defendants initially named in the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">In many cases the scheduling order can and should be entered before this deadline. However, when setting a scheduling conference, the court should take into account the effect this setting will have in establishing deadlines for the parties to meet under revised Rule 26(f) and to exchange information under revised Rule 26(a)(1). While the parties are expected to stipulate to additional time for making their disclosures when warranted by the circumstances, a scheduling conference held before defendants have had time to learn much about the case may result in diminishing the value of the Rule 26(f) meeting, the parties&rsquo; proposed discovery plan, and indeed the conference itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">New paragraph (4) has been added to highlight that it will frequently be desirable for the scheduling order to include provisions relating to the timing of disclosures under Rule 26(a). While the initial disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1) will ordinarily have been made before entry of the scheduling order, the timing and sequence for disclosure of expert testimony and of the witnesses and exhibits to be used at trial should be tailored to the circumstances of the case and is a matter that should be considered at the initial scheduling conference. Similarly, the scheduling order might contain provisions modifying the extent of discovery (<em>e.g</em>., number and length of depositions) otherwise permitted under these rules or by a local rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The report from the attorneys concerning their meeting and proposed discovery plan, as required by revised Rule 26(f), should be submitted to the court before the scheduling order is entered. Their proposals, particularly regarding matters on which they agree, should be of substantial value to the court in setting the timing and limitations on discovery and should reduce the time of the court needed to conduct a meaningful conference under Rule 16(b). As under the prior rule, while a scheduling order is mandated, a scheduling conference is not. However, in view of the benefits to be derived from the litigants and a judicial officer meeting in person, a Rule 16(b) conference should, to the extent practicable, be held in all cases that will involve discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision, as well as subdivision (c)(8), also is revised to reflect the new title of United States Magistrate Judges pursuant to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:117 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The primary purposes of the changes in subdivision (c) are to call attention to the opportunities for structuring of trial under Rules 42, 50, and 52 and to eliminate questions that have occasionally been raised regarding the authority of the court to make appropriate orders designed either to facilitate settlement or to provide for an efficient and economical trial. The prefatory language of this subdivision is revised to clarify the court's power to enter appropriate orders at a conference notwithstanding the objection of a party. Of course settlement is dependent upon agreement by the parties and, indeed, a conference is most effective and productive when the parties participate in a spirit of cooperation and mindful of their responsibilities under Rule 1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (4) is revised to clarify that in advance of trial the court may address the need for, and possible limitations on, the use of expert testimony under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Even when proposed expert testimony might be admissible under the standards of Rules 403 and 702 of the evidence rules, the court may preclude or limit such testimony if the cost to the litigants&mdash;which may include the cost to adversaries of securing testimony on the same subjects by other experts&mdash;would be unduly expensive given the needs of the case and the other evidence available at trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (5) is added (and the remaining paragraphs renumbered) in recognition that use of Rule 56 to avoid or reduce the scope of trial is a topic that can, and often should, be considered at a pretrial conference. Renumbered paragraph (11) enables the court to rule on pending motions for summary adjudication that are ripe for decision at the time of the conference. Often, however, the potential use of Rule 56 is a matter that arises from discussions during a conference. The court may then call for motions to be filed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (6) is added to emphasize that a major objective of pretrial conferences should be to consider appropriate controls on the extent and timing of discovery. In many cases the court should also specify the times and sequence for disclosure of written reports from experts under revised Rule 26(a)(2)(B) and perhaps direct changes in the types of experts from whom written reports are required. Consideration should also be given to possible changes in the timing or form of the disclosure of trial witnesses and documents under Rule 26(a)(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (9) is revised to describe more accurately the various procedures that, in addition to traditional settlement conferences, may be helpful in settling litigation. Even if a case cannot immediately be settled, the judge and attorneys can explore possible use of alternative procedures such as mini-trials, summary jury trials, mediation, neutral evaluation, and nonbinding arbitration that can lead to consensual resolution of the dispute without a full trial on the merits. The rule acknowledges the presence of statutes and local rules or plans that may authorize use of some of these procedures even when not agreed to by the parties. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;473(a)(6), 473(b)(4), 651&ndash;58; Section 104(b)(2), Pub.L. 101&ndash;650. The rule does not attempt to resolve questions as to the extent a court would be authorized to require such proceedings as an exercise of its inherent powers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of paragraph (9) should be read in conjunction with the sentence added to the end of subdivision (c), authorizing the court to direct that, in appropriate cases, a responsible representative of the parties be present or available by telephone during a conference in order to discuss possible settlement of the case. The sentence refers to participation by a party or its representative. Whether this would be the individual party, an officer of a corporate party, a representative from an insurance carrier, or someone else would depend on the circumstances. Particularly in litigation in which governmental agencies or large amounts of money are involved, there may be no one with on-the-spot settlement authority, and the most that should be expected is access to a person who would have a major role in submitting a recommendation to the body or board with ultimate decision-making responsibility. The selection of the appropriate representative should ordinarily be left to the party and its counsel. Finally, it should be noted that the unwillingness of a party to be available, even by telephone, for a settlement conference may be a clear signal that the time and expense involved in pursuing settlement is likely to be unproductive and that personal participation by the parties should not be required.</p>
<p class="note-body">The explicit authorization in the rule to require personal participation in the manner stated is not intended to limit the reasonable exercise of the court's inherent powers, <em>e.g., G. Heileman Brewing Co. v. Joseph Oat Corp</em>., 871 F.2d 648 (7th Cir. 1989), or its power to require party participation under the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;473(b)(5) (civil justice expense and delay reduction plans adopted by district courts may include requirement that representatives &ldquo;with authority to bind [parties] in settlement discussions&rdquo; be available during settlement conferences).</p>
<p class="note-body">New paragraphs (13) and (14) are added to call attention to the opportunities for structuring of trial under Rule 42 and under revised Rules 50 and 52.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (15) is also new. It supplements the power of the court to limit the extent of evidence under Rules 403 and 611(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which typically would be invoked as a result of developments during trial. Limits on the length of trial established at a conference in advance of trial can provide the parties with a better opportunity to determine priorities and exercise selectivity in presenting evidence than when limits are imposed during trial. Any such limits must be reasonable under the circumstances, and ordinarily the court should impose them only after receiving appropriate submissions from the parties outlining the nature of the testimony expected to be presented through various witnesses, and the expected duration of direct and cross-examination.</p>
