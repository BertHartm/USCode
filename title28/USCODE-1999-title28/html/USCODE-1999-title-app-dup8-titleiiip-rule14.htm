<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Third Parties May Be Brought In. (1)</strong> The court, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, may notify any person with legal capacity to sue and be sued and who is alleged to have an interest in the subject matter of any pending action to appear as a party and assert an interest, if any, therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> On motion of the United States, the court may summon any third person against whom <!-- PDFPage:381 -->the United States may be asserting a claim or contingent claim for the recovery of money paid by the United States in respect of the transaction or matter which constitutes the subject matter of the suit to appear as a party and defend the third party's interest, if any, in such suit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> A motion made by the plaintiff under subdivision (a)(1) hereof shall be filed at the time the complaint is filed. Copies and service of such a motion shall be as provided in Rules 3(c) and 4. A motion made by the United States under subdivision (a)(1) or (2) hereof shall be filed on or before the date on which the answer is required to be filed. For good cause shown, the court may allow any such motion to be filed at a later time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Content of Motion for Notice to Third Parties.</strong> A party desiring to bring in a third party pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of this rule shall file with the clerk a written motion which shall:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> state the name and address of such person, if known;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> if the address of such person is unknown, or if such person resides outside the jurisdiction of the United States, or there is good reason why service on such person cannot be had, be accompanied by an affidavit showing why service cannot be had on such person and stating the last-known address of such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> set forth the interest which such person appears to have in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Issuance and Service of Notice. (1)</strong> If the court, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, orders any third person to be notified pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of this rule, the clerk shall issue an original and 1 copy of the notice for each third person to be notified. The notice shall contain the names of the parties and a statement of the time within which such third person may appear and shall state that in case the third party fails to appear and assert a claim in the subject matter of the action, the claim or interest of the third party therein shall forever be barred. The notice shall indicate that it is accompanied by a copy of the pleadings, which shall be attached by the moving party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> Upon the issuance of such notice upon motion of a party, the notice shall be delivered by the clerk to the moving party, who shall at the moving party's expense cause the same to be served on the person to be notified by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, with the moving party to file with the clerk the return of such service, which return shall include the copy of the notice with return receipt attached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> When the court directs the issuance of a notice to a third person on its own motion, each of the existing parties shall, on request of the clerk, deliver to the clerk a sufficient number of copies of pleadings filed by such party to provide the third party to be notified with a copy of each of such pleadings, and the clerk shall forthwith issue such notice as specified in subdivision (c)(1) of this rule and shall forward the same with accompanying copies of the pleadings to the Attorney General for service as provided in subdivision (c)(2) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4)</strong> When service of the notice required by subdivision (c)(1) of this rule is to be effected upon a third person in a foreign country, service of the notice may be made by the moving party or the court, as required by subdivisions (c)(2) and (3) of this rule, and proof of such service may be made in the manner authorized by Rule 4(i) of the Federal Rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Service of Notice by Publication.</strong> Where, upon motion of a party, the court under subdivision (a)(1) of this rule directs the issuance of a notice to a person upon whom service cannot be had, the moving party shall cause such notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in a place designated in the order, for a specified time, not less than once in each of 4 successive weeks. On or before the day of the first publication, the moving party shall send a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail to such person at such person's last-known address and shall file with the clerk an affidavit showing such mailing. The moving party shall procure an affidavit of the publisher showing that publication of the notice has been had as required by the order and shall file such affidavit with the clerk, who shall make an entry on the docket that publication has been had. The affidavit of mailing and the publisher's affidavit, together with the clerk's entry, shall constitute proof of service by publication. Service shall be deemed complete on the date of the last publication. The costs of such service by publication shall be paid by the party at whose instance it was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Contents of Motion for Summons to Third Parties.</strong> When the United States is asserting a claim for damages or other demand against a third person for the recovery of money paid by the United States in respect of the transaction or matter which constitutes the subject matter of any pending action and desires to have such third person brought in pursuant to subdivision (a)(2) of this rule, it shall file a written motion, which shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (b) of this rule and which shall be accompanied by an appropriate pleading setting forth the claim or contingent claim which it is asserting against such third person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Issuance and Service of Summons.</strong> If the court, on motion of the United States, summons a third person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2) of this rule to answer a claim or contingent claim asserted by the United States, the clerk shall issue an original and 1 copy of such summons for each person to be summoned. The summons shall contain the names of the parties and a statement of the time within which the party summoned is required to appear and answer. The summons shall also state that the United States is asserting a claim against such person, as described in the accompanying pleading of the United States, and shall further state that if such third person fails to appear and answer the claim asserted by the United States, judgment <em>pro confesso</em> may be entered against such third person upon the claim of the United States to the same extent as if said third person had appeared and admitted the truth of all the allegations made on behalf of the United States. The summons shall indicate that it is accompanied by a copy or copies of all pleadings filed in said action, naming such pleadings which shall be attached by the moving party. Upon issuance of <!-- PDFPage:382 -->the summons, the clerk shall deliver the summons to the Attorney General for personal service and the return of such service shall be made directly to the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Pleadings of Third Parties.</strong> Within 40 days after service upon a third person of a notice or summons issued pursuant to this rule, such person may file a complaint setting forth the person's interest, if any, in the subject matter of the action and the nature of the person's claim against the United States, or an answer, or both, which pleadings shall comply with the requirements of these rules with respect to the filing of original complaints and answers, except that only an original and 2 copies of a complaint are to be filed with proof of service.</p>
