<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Entry.</strong> When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter such party's default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Judgment.</strong> Judgment by default may be entered as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1) <em>By the Clerk.</em></strong> When the plaintiff's claim against a defendant is for a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain, the clerk upon request of the plaintiff and upon affidavit of the amount due shall enter judgment for that amount and costs against the defendant, if the defendant has been defaulted for failure to appear and if the defendant is not an infant or incompetent person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>By the Court.</em></strong> In all other cases, the party entitled to a judgment by default shall apply to the court therefor; but no judgment by default shall be entered against an infant or incompetent person unless represented in the action by a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other such representative who has appeared therein. If the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action, such party or, if appearing by representative, such party's representative, shall be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior to the hearing, if any, on such application. If, in order to enable the court to enter judgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of damages or to establish the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an investigation of any other matter, the court may conduct such hearings or order such references as it deems necessary and proper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Setting Aside Default.</strong> For good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Plaintiffs; Counterclaimants.</strong> The provisions of this rule apply whether the party entitled to the judgment by default is a plaintiff, a third-party plaintiff, or a party who has pleaded a counterclaim. In all cases a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of Rule 54(c).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:401 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Judgment Against the United States.</strong> No judgment by default shall be entered against the United States unless the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.</p>
