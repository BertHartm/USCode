<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Caption; Names of Parties.</strong> Every pleading shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the court, the title of the action, the file number, and a designation as in RCFC 7(a). In the complaint the title of the action shall include the names of all the parties, see RCFC 20(a), the United States being designated as the party defendant, but in other pleadings it is sufficient to state the name of the first party on each side with an appropriate indication of other parties. (For Notice of Appeal see RCFC 58.1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Paragraphs; Separate Statements.</strong> All averments of claim or defense shall be made in numbered paragraphs, the contents of each of which shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances; and a paragraph may be referred to by number in all succeeding pleadings. Each claim founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence and each defense other than denials shall be stated in a separate count or defense whenever a separation facilitates the clear presentation of the matters set forth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Adoption by Reference; Exhibits.</strong> Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or in another pleading or in any motion. A copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 10 has been changed in minor respects in order to achieve closer textual conformity with FRCP 10. The deleted last sentence of subdivision (a) was moved to RCFC 5.3.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of former subdivision (c) (&ldquo;unless otherwise indicated, but the adverse party shall not be deemed to have admitted the truth of the allegations in such exhibit merely because the adverse party has failed to deny them explicitly&rdquo;) was omitted as not in conformity with the federal rule, and because it was deemed unnecessary.</p>
