<h3 class="section-head">Rule 53. Masters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Appointment and Compensation</cap-smallcap>. The court in which any action is pending may appoint a special master therein. As used in these rules, the word &ldquo;master&rdquo; includes a referee, an auditor, an examiner, and an assessor. The compensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties or paid out of any fund or subject matter of the action, which is in the custody and control of the court as the court may direct; provided that this provision for compensation shall not apply when a United States magistrate judge is designated to serve as a master. The master shall not retain the master's report as security for the master's compensation; but when the party ordered to pay the compensation allowed by the court does not pay it after notice and within the time prescribed by the court, the master is entitled to a writ of execution against the delinquent party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reference</cap-smallcap>. A reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule. In actions to be tried by a jury, a reference shall be made only when the issues are complicated; in actions to be tried without a jury, save in matters of account and of difficult computation of damages, a reference shall be made only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it. Upon the consent of the parties, a magistrate judge may be designated to serve as a special master without regard to the provisions of this subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Powers</cap-smallcap>. The order of reference to the master may specify or limit the master's powers and may direct the master to report only upon particular issues or to do or perform particular acts or to receive and report evidence only and may fix the time and place for beginning and closing the hearings and for the filing of the master's report. Subject to the specifications and limitations stated in the order, the master has and shall exercise the power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before the master and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the master's duties under the order. The master may require the production before the master of evidence upon all matters embraced in the reference, including the production of all books, papers, vouchers, documents, and writings applicable thereto. The master may rule upon the admissibility of evidence unless otherwise directed by the order of reference and has the authority to put witnesses on oath and may examine them and may call the parties to the action and examine them upon oath. When a party so requests, the master shall make a record of the evidence offered and excluded in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as provided in the Federal Rules of Evidence for a court sitting without a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Proceedings.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Meetings</em>. When a reference is made, the clerk shall forthwith furnish the master with a copy of the order of reference. Upon receipt thereof unless the order of reference otherwise provides, the master shall forthwith set a time and place for the first meeting of the parties or their attorneys to be held within 20 days after the date of the order of reference and shall notify the parties or their attorneys. It is the duty of the master to proceed with all reasonable diligence. Either party, on notice <!-- PDFPage:188 -->to the parties and master, may apply to the court for an order requiring the master to speed the proceedings and to make the report. If a party fails to appear at the time and place appointed, the master may proceed ex parte or, in the master's discretion, adjourn the proceedings to a future day, giving notice to the absent party of the adjournment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Witnesses</em>. The parties may procure the attendance of witnesses before the master by the issuance and service of subpoenas as provided in Rule 45. If without adequate excuse a witness fails to appear or give evidence, the witness may be punished as for a contempt and be subjected to the consequences, penalties, and remedies provided in Rules 37 and 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Statement of Accounts</em>. When matters of accounting are in issue before the master, the master may prescribe the form in which the accounts shall be submitted and in any proper case may require or receive in evidence a statement by a certified public accountant who is called as a witness. Upon objection of a party to any of the items thus submitted or upon a showing that the form of statement is insufficient, the master may require a different form of statement to be furnished, or the accounts or specific items thereof to be proved by oral examination of the accounting parties or upon written interrogatories or in such other manner as the master directs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Report.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Contents and Filing</em>. The master shall prepare a report upon the matters submitted to the master by the order of reference and, if required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, the master shall set them forth in the report. The master shall file the report with the clerk of the court and serve on all parties notice of the filing. In an action to be tried without a jury, unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall file with the report a transcript of the proceedings and of the evidence and the original exhibits. Unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall serve a copy of the report on each party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>In Non-Jury Actions</em>. In an action to be tried without a jury the court shall accept the master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. Within 10 days after being served with notice of the filing of the report any party may serve written objections thereto upon the other parties. Application to the court for action upon the report and upon objections thereto shall be by motion and upon notice as prescribed in Rule 6(d). The court after hearing may adopt the report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part or may receive further evidence or may recommit it with instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>In Jury Actions</em>. In an action to be tried by a jury the master shall not be directed to report the evidence. The master's findings upon the issues submitted to the master are admissible as evidence of the matters found and may be read to the jury, subject to the ruling of the court upon any objections in point of law which may be made to the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Stipulation as to Findings</em>. The effect of a master's report is the same whether or not the parties have consented to the reference; but, when the parties stipulate that a master's findings of fact shall be final, only questions of law arising upon the report shall thereafter be considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Draft Report</em>. Before filing the master's report a master may submit a draft thereof to counsel for all parties for the purpose of receiving their suggestions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application to Magistrate Judge</cap-smallcap>. A magistrate judge is subject to this rule only when the order referring a matter to the magistrate judge expressly provides that the reference is made under this rule.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a</em>). This is a modification of [former] Equity Rule 68 (Appointment and Compensation of Masters).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b</em>). This is substantially the first sentence of [former] Equity Rule 59 (Reference to Master&mdash;Exceptional, Not Usual) extended to actions formerly legal. See <em>Ex parte Peterson</em> 253 U.S. 300, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c</em>). This is [former] Equity Rules 62 (Powers of Master) and 65 (Claimants Before Master Examinable by Him) with slight modifications. Compare [former] Equity Rules 49 (Evidence Taken Before Examiners, Etc.) and 51 (Evidence Taken Before Examiners, Etc.).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d</em>). (1) This is substantially a combination of the second sentence of [former] Equity Rule 59 (Reference to Master&mdash;Exceptional, Not Usual) and [former] Equity Rule 60 (Proceedings Before Master). Compare [former] Equity Rule 53 (Notice of Taking Testimony Before Examiner, Etc.).</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) This is substantially [former] Equity Rule 52 (Attendance of Witnesses Before Commissioner, Master, or Examiner).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) This is substantially [former] Equity Rule 63 (Form of Accounts Before Master).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e</em>). This contains the substance of [former] Equity Rules 61 (Master's Report&mdash;Documents Identified but not Set Forth), 611/2 (Master's Report&mdash;Presumption as to Correctness&mdash;Review), and 66 (Return of Master's Report&mdash;Exceptions&mdash;Hearing), with modifications as to the form and effect of the report and for inclusion of reports by auditors, referees, and examiners, and references in actions formerly legal.

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">These changes are designed to preserve the admiralty practice whereby difficult computations are referred to a commissioner or assessor, especially after an interlocutory judgment determining liability. As to separation of issues for trial see Rule 42(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The creation of full-time magistrates, who serve at government expense and have no nonjudicial duties competing for their time, eliminates the need to appoint standing masters. Thus the prior provision in Rule 53(a) authorizing the appointment of standing masters is deleted. Additionally, the definition of &ldquo;master&rdquo; in subdivision (a) now eliminates the superseded office of commissioner.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:189 --><p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;special master&rdquo; is retained in Rule 53 in order to maintain conformity with 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(2), authorizing a judge to designate a magistrate &ldquo;to serve as a special master pursuant to the applicable provisions of this title and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts.&rdquo; Obviously, when a magistrate serves as a special master, the provisions for compensation of masters are inapplicable, and the amendment to subdivision (a) so provides.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the existence of magistrates may make the appointment of outside masters unnecessary in many instances, see, <em>e.g., Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority</em>, 384 F.Supp. 37 (N.D.Ill. 1974), mandamus denied <em>sub nom., Chicago Housing Authority v. Austin</em>, 511 F.2d 82 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Avco Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co</em>., 68 F.R.D. 532 (S.D. Ohio 1975), such masters may prove useful when some special expertise is desired or when a magistrate is unavailable for lengthy and detailed supervision of a case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(2) not only permit magistrates to serve as masters under Rule 53(b) but also eliminate the exceptional condition requirement of Rule 53(b) when the reference is made with the consent of the parties. The amendment to subdivision (b) brings Rule 53 into harmony with the statute by exempting magistrates, appointed with the consent of the parties, from the general requirement that some exceptional condition requires the reference. It should be noted that subdivision (b) does not address the question, raised in recent decisional law and commentary, as to whether the exceptional condition requirement is applicable when <em>private masters </em>who are not magistrates are appointed with the consent of the parties. See Silberman, <em>Masters and Magistrates Part II: The American Analogue</em>, 50 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1297, 1354 (1975).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment recognizes the abrogation of Federal Rule 43(c) by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. The new subdivision responds to confusion flowing from the dual authority for references of pretrial matters to magistrates. Such references can be made, with or without the consent of the parties, pursuant to Rule 53 or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B). There are a number of distinctions between references made under the statute and under the rule. For example, under the statute nondispositive pretrial matters may be referred to a magistrate, without consent, for final determination with reconsideration by the district judge if the magistrate's order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law. Under the rule, however, the appointment of a master, without consent of the parties, to supervise discovery would require some exceptional condition (Rule 53(b)) and would subject the proceedings to the report procedures of Rule 53(e). If an order of reference does not clearly articulate the source of the court's authority the resulting proceedings could be subject to attack on grounds of the magistrate's noncompliance with the provisions of Rule 53. This subdivision therefore establishes a presumption that the limitations of Rule 53 are not applicable unless the reference is specifically made subject to Rule 53.</p>
<p class="note-body">A magistrate serving as a special master under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(2) is governed by the provisions of Rule 53, with the exceptional condition requirement lifted in the case of a consensual reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the revision is to expedite proceedings before a master. The former rule required only a filing of the master's report, with the clerk then notifying the parties of the filing. To receive a copy, a party would then be required to secure it from the clerk. By transmitting directly to the parties, the master can save some efforts of counsel. Some local rules have previously required such action by the master.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This revision is made to conform the rule to changes made by the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.</p>
