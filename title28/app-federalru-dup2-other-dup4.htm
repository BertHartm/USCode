<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise required by the Constitution of the United States or provided by Act of Congress or in rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience. However, in civil actions and proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be determined in accordance with State law.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Article V as submitted to Congress contained thirteen Rules. Nine of those Rules defined specific non-constitutional privileges which the federal courts must recognize (i.e. required reports, lawyer-client, psychotherapist-patient, husband-wife, communications to clergymen, political vote, trade secrets, secrets of state and other official information, and identity of informer). Another Rule provided that only those privileges set forth in Article V or in some other Act of Congress could be recognized by the federal courts. The three remaining Rules addressed collateral problems as to waiver of privilege by voluntary disclosure, privileged matter disclosed under compulsion or without opportunity to claim privilege, comment upon or inference from a claim of privilege, and jury instruction with regard thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee amended Article V to eliminate all of the Court's specific Rules on privileges. Instead, the Committee, through a single Rule, 501, left the law of privileges in its present state and further provided that privileges shall continue to be developed by the courts of the United States under a uniform standard applicable both in civil and criminal cases. That standard, derived from Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, mandates the application of the principles of the common law as interpreted by the Courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience. The words &ldquo;person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof&rdquo; were added by the Committee to the lone term &ldquo;witness&rdquo; used in Rule 26 to make clear that, as under present law, not only witnesses may have privileges. The Committee also included in its amendment a proviso modeled after Rule 302 and similar to language added by the Committee to Rule 601 relating to the competency of witnesses. The proviso is designed to require the application of State privilege law in civil actions and proceedings governed by <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), a result in accord with current federal court decisions. See <em>Republic Gear Co. v. Borg-Warner Corp</em>., 381 F.2d 551, 555&ndash;556 n.2 (2nd Cir. 1967). The Committee deemed the proviso to be necessary in the light of the Advisory Committee's view (see its note to Court [proposed] Rule 501) that this result is not mandated under <em>Erie.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">The rationale underlying the proviso is that federal law should not supersede that of the States in substantive areas such as privilege absent a compelling reason. The Committee believes that in civil cases in the federal courts where an element of a claim or defense is not grounded upon a federal question, there is no federal interest strong enough to justify departure from State policy. In addition, the Committee considered that the Court's proposed Article V would have <!-- PDFPage:366 -->promoted forum shopping in some civil actions, depending upon differences in the privilege law applied as among the State and federal courts. The Committee's proviso, on the other hand, under which the federal courts are bound to apply the State's privilege law in actions founded upon a State-created right or defense removes the incentive to &ldquo;shop&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">Article V as submitted to Congress contained 13 rules. Nine of those rules defined specific nonconstitutional privileges which the Federal courts must recognize (i.e., required reports, lawyer-client, psychotherapist-patient, husband-wife, communications to clergymen, political vote, trade secrets, secrets of state and other official information, and identity of informer). Many of these rules contained controversial modifications or restrictions upon common law privileges. As noted supra, the House amended article V to eliminate all of the Court's specific rules on privileges. Through a single rule, 501, the House provided that privileges shall be governed by the principles of the common law as interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience (a standard derived from rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure) except in the case of an element of a civil claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision, in which event state privilege law was to govern.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee agrees with the main thrust of the House amendment: that a federally developed common law based on modern reason and experience shall apply except where the State nature of the issues renders deference to State privilege law the wiser course, as in the usual diversity case. The committee understands that thrust of the House amendment to require that State privilege law be applied in &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; cases (actions on questions of State law between citizens of different States arising under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1332). The language of the House amendment, however, goes beyond this in some respects, and falls short of it in others: State privilege law applies even in nondiversity. Federal question civil cases, where an issue governed by State substantive law is the object of the evidence (such issues do sometimes arise in such cases); and, in all instances where State privilege law is to be applied, e.g., on proof of a State issue in a diversity case, a close reading reveals that State privilege law is not to be applied unless the matter to be proved is an element of that state claim or defense, as distinguished from a step along the way in the proof of it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee is concerned that the language used in the House amendment could be difficult to apply. It provides that &ldquo;in civil actions *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision,&rdquo; State law on privilege applies. The question of what is an element of a claim or defense is likely to engender considerable litigation. If the matter in question constitutes an element of a claim, State law supplies the privilege rule; whereas if it is a mere item of proof with respect to a claim, then, even though State law might supply the rule of decision, Federal law on the privilege would apply. Further, disputes will arise as to how the rule should be applied in an antitrust action or in a tax case where the Federal statute is silent as to a particular aspect of the substantive law in question, but Federal cases had incorporated State law by reference to State law. [For a discussion of reference to State substantive law, see note on Federal Incorporation by Reference of State Law, Hart & Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, pp. 491&ndash;494 (2d ed. 1973).] Is a claim (or defense) based on such a reference a claim or defense as to which federal or State law supplies the rule of decision?</p>
<p class="note-body">Another problem not entirely avoidable is the complexity or difficulty the rule introduces into the trial of a Federal case containing a combination of Federal and State claims and defenses, e.g. an action involving Federal antitrust and State unfair competition claims. Two different bodies of privilege law would need to be consulted. It may even develop that the same witness-testimony might be relevant on both counts and privileged as to one but not the other. [The problems with the House formulation are discussed in Rothstein, The Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence, 62 Georgetown University Law Journal 125 (1973) at notes 25, 26 and 70&ndash;74 and accompanying text.]</p>
<p class="note-body">The formulation adopted by the House is pregnant with litigious mischief. The committee has, therefore, adopted what we believe will be a clearer and more practical guideline for determining when courts should respect State rules of privilege. Basically, it provides that in criminal and Federal question civil cases, federally evolved rules on privilege should apply since it is Federal policy which is being enforced. [It is also intended that the Federal law of privileges should be applied with respect to pendant State law claims when they arise in a Federal question case.] Conversely, in diversity cases where the litigation in question turns on a substantive question of State law, and is brought in the Federal courts because the parties reside in different States, the committee believes it is clear that State rules of privilege should apply unless the proof is directed at a claim or defense for which Federal law supplies the rule of decision (a situation which would not commonly arise.) [While such a situation might require use of two bodies of privilege law, federal and state, in the same case, nevertheless the occasions on which this would be required are considerably reduced as compared with the House version, and confined to situations where the Federal and State interests are such as to justify application of neither privilege law to the case as a whole. If the rule proposed here results in two conflicting bodies of privilege law applying to the same piece of evidence in the same case, it is contemplated that the rule favoring reception of the evidence should be applied. This policy is based on the present rule 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which provides:</p>
<p class="note-body-block">In any case, the statute or rule which favors the reception of the evidence governs and the evidence shall be presented according to the most convenient method prescribed in any of the statutes or rules to which reference is herein made.] It is intended that the State rules of privilege should apply equally in original diversity actions and diversity actions removed under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1441(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Two other comments on the privilege rule should be made. The committee has received a considerable volume of correspondence from psychiatric organizations and psychiatrists concerning the deletion of rule 504 of the rule submitted by the Supreme Court. It should be clearly understood that, in approving this general rule as to privileges, the action of Congress should not be understood as disapproving any recognition of a psychiatrist-patient, or husband-wife, or any other of the enumerated privileges contained in the Supreme Court rules. Rather, our action should be understood as reflecting the view that the recognition of a privilege based on a confidential relationship and other privileges should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">Further, we would understand that the prohibition against spouses testifying against each other is considered a rule of privilege and covered by this rule and not by rule 601 of the competency of witnesses.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 501 deals with the privilege of a witness not to testify. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal privilege law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state privilege law applies &ldquo;to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.&rdquo; The Senate bill provides that &ldquo;in civil actions and proceedings arising under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1332 or 28 U.S.C. &sect;1335, or between citizens of different States and removed under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1441(b) the privilege of a wit<!-- PDFPage:367 -->ness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to &ldquo;an element of a claim or defense.&rdquo; If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state privilege law applies to that item of proof.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the provision in the House bill, therefore, state privilege law will usually apply in diversity cases. There may be diversity cases, however, where a claim or defense is based upon federal law. In such instances, Federal privilege law will apply to evidence relevant to the federal claim or defense. See <em>Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co</em>., 317 U.S. 173 (1942).</p>
<p class="note-body">In nondiversity jurisdiction civil cases, federal privilege law will generally apply. In those situations where a federal court adopts or incorporates state law to fill interstices or gaps in federal statutory phrases, the court generally will apply federal privilege law. As Justice Jackson has said:</p>
<p class="note-body">A federal court sitting in a non-diversity case such as this does not sit as a local tribunal. In some cases it may see fit for special reasons to give the law of a particular state highly persuasive or even controlling effect, but in the last analysis its decision turns upon the law of the United States, not that of any state.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</em>., 315 U.S. 447, 471 (1942) (Jackson, J., concurring). When a federal court chooses to absorb state law, it is applying the state law as a matter of federal common law. Thus, state law does not supply the rule of decision (even though the federal court may apply a rule derived from state decisions), and state privilege law would not apply. See C. A. Wright, Federal Courts 251&ndash;252 (2d ed. 1970); <em>Holmberg v. Armbrecht</em>, 327 U.S. 392 (1946); <em>DeSylva v. Ballentine</em>, 351 U.S. 570, 581 (1956); 9 Wright & Miller, Federal Rules and Procedure &sect;2408.</p>
<p class="note-body">In civil actions and proceedings, where the rule of decision as to a claim or defense or as to an element of a claim or defense is supplied by state law, the House provision requires that state privilege law apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the House provision.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 502. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure Made in a Federal Proceeding or to a Federal Office or Agency; Scope of a Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the disclosure is made in a Federal proceeding or to a Federal office or agency and waives the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed communication or information in a Federal or State proceeding only if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the waiver is intentional;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information concern the same subject matter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) they ought in fairness to be considered together.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inadvertent Disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When made in a Federal proceeding or to a Federal office or agency, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a Federal or State proceeding if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the disclosure is inadvertent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error, including (if applicable) following Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure Made in a State Proceeding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the disclosure is made in a State proceeding and is not the subject of a State-court order concerning waiver, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a Federal proceeding if the disclosure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been made in a Federal proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not a waiver under the law of the State where the disclosure occurred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Controlling Effect of a Court Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A Federal court may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court&mdash;in which event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other Federal or State proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An agreement on the effect of disclosure in a Federal proceeding is binding only on the parties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Controlling Effect of This Rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding Rules 101 and 1101, this rule applies to State proceedings and to Federal court-annexed and Federal court-mandated arbitration proceedings, in the circumstances set out in the rule. And notwithstanding Rule 501, this rule applies even if State law provides the rule of decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this rule:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;attorney-client privilege&rdquo; means the protection that applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client communications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;work-product protection&rdquo; means the protection that applicable law provides for tangible material (or its intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Explanatory Note on Evidence Rule 502</h4>
<p class="note-body">The following explanatory note was prepared by the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules, revised Nov. 28, 2007:</p>
<p class="note-body">This new rule has two major purposes:</p>
<p class="note-body">1) It resolves some longstanding disputes in the courts about the effect of certain disclosures of communications or information protected by the attorney-client privilege or as work product&mdash;specifically those disputes involving inadvertent disclosure and subject matter waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">2) It responds to the widespread complaint that litigation costs necessary to protect against waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product have become prohibitive due to the concern that any disclosure (however innocent or minimal) will operate as a subject matter waiver of all protected communications or information. This concern is especially troubling in cases involving electronic discovery. <em>See, e.g., Hopson v. City of Baltimore</em>, 232 F.R.D. 228, 244 (D.Md. 2005) (electronic discovery may encompass &ldquo;millions of documents&rdquo; and to insist upon &ldquo;record-by-record pre-production privilege review, on pain of subject matter waiver, would impose upon parties costs of production that bear no proportionality to what is at stake in the litigation&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule seeks to provide a predictable, uniform set of standards under which parties can determine the <!-- PDFPage:368 -->consequences of a disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection. Parties to litigation need to know, for example, that if they exchange privileged information pursuant to a confidentiality order, the court's order will be enforceable. Moreover, if a federal court's confidentiality order is not enforceable in a state court then the burdensome costs of privilege review and retention are unlikely to be reduced.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule makes no attempt to alter federal or state law on whether a communication or information is protected under the attorney-client privilege or work-product immunity as an initial matter. Moreover, while establishing some exceptions to waiver, the rule does not purport to supplant applicable waiver doctrine generally.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule governs only certain waivers by disclosure. Other common-law waiver doctrines may result in a finding of waiver even where there is no disclosure of privileged information or work product. <em>See, e.g., Nguyen v. Excel Corp.</em>, 197 F.3d 200 (5th Cir. 1999) (reliance on an advice of counsel defense waives the privilege with respect to attorney-client communications pertinent to that defense); <em>Ryers v. Burleson</em>, 100 F.R.D. 436 (D.D.C. 1983) (allegation of lawyer malpractice constituted a waiver of confidential communications under the circumstances). The rule is not intended to displace or modify federal common law concerning waiver of privilege or work product where no disclosure has been made.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The rule provides that a voluntary disclosure in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency, if a waiver, generally results in a waiver only of the communication or information disclosed; a subject matter waiver (of either privilege or work product) is reserved for those unusual situations in which fairness requires a further disclosure of related, protected information, in order to prevent a selective and misleading presentation of evidence to the disadvantage of the adversary. <em>See, e.g., In re United Mine Workers of America Employee Benefit Plans Litig.</em>, 159 F.R.D. 307, 312 (D.D.C. 1994) (waiver of work product limited to materials actually disclosed, because the party did not deliberately disclose documents in an attempt to gain a tactical advantage). Thus, subject matter waiver is limited to situations in which a party intentionally puts protected information into the litigation in a selective, misleading and unfair manner. It follows that an inadvertent disclosure of protected information can never result in a subject matter waiver. <em>See</em> Rule 502(b). The rule rejects the result in <em>In re Sealed Case</em>, 877 F.2d 976 (D.C.Cir. 1989), which held that inadvertent disclosure of documents during discovery automatically constituted a subject matter waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language concerning subject matter waiver&mdash;&ldquo;ought in fairness&rdquo;&mdash;is taken from Rule 106, because the animating principle is the same. Under both Rules, a party that makes a selective, misleading presentation that is unfair to the adversary opens itself to a more complete and accurate presentation.</p>
<p class="note-body">To assure protection and predictability, the rule provides that if a disclosure is made at the federal level, the federal rule on subject matter waiver governs subsequent state court determinations on the scope of the waiver by that disclosure.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Courts are in conflict over whether an inadvertent disclosure of a communication or information protected as privileged or work product constitutes a waiver. A few courts find that a disclosure must be intentional to be a waiver. Most courts find a waiver only if the disclosing party acted carelessly in disclosing the communication or information and failed to request its return in a timely manner. And a few courts hold that any inadvertent disclosure of a communication or information protected under the attorney-client privilege or as work product constitutes a waiver without regard to the protections taken to avoid such a disclosure. <em>See generally Hopson v. City of Baltimore</em>, 232 F.R.D. 228 (D.Md. 2005), for a discussion of this case law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule opts for the middle ground: inadvertent disclosure of protected communications or information in connection with a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency does not constitute a waiver if the holder took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure and also promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error. This position is in accord with the majority view on whether inadvertent disclosure is a waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">Cases such as <em>Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss & Co.</em>, 104 F.R.D. 103, 105 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) and <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Garvey</em>, 109 F.R.D. 323, 332 (N.D.Cal. 1985), set out a multifactor test for determining whether inadvertent disclosure is a waiver. The stated factors (none of which is dispositive) are the reasonableness of precautions taken, the time taken to rectify the error, the scope of discovery, the extent of disclosure and the overriding issue of fairness. The rule does not explicitly codify that test, because it is really a set of non-determinative guidelines that vary from case to case. The rule is flexible enough to accommodate any of those listed factors. Other considerations bearing on the reasonableness of a producing party's efforts include the number of documents to be reviewed and the time constraints for production. Depending on the circumstances, a party that uses advanced analytical software applications and linguistic tools in screening for privilege and work product may be found to have taken &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; to prevent inadvertent disclosure. The implementation of an efficient system of records management before litigation may also be relevant.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not require the producing party to engage in a post-production review to determine whether any protected communication or information has been produced by mistake. But the rule does require the producing party to follow up on any obvious indications that a protected communication or information has been produced inadvertently.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule applies to inadvertent disclosures made to a federal office or agency, including but not limited to an office or agency that is acting in the course of its regulatory, investigative or enforcement authority. The consequences of waiver, and the concomitant costs of pre-production privilege review, can be as great with respect to disclosures to offices and agencies as they are in litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Difficult questions can arise when 1) a disclosure of a communication or information protected by the attorney-client privilege or as work product is made in a state proceeding, 2) the communication or information is offered in a subsequent federal proceeding on the ground that the disclosure waived the privilege or protection, and 3) the state and federal laws are in conflict on the question of waiver. The Committee determined that the proper solution for the federal court is to apply the law that is most protective of privilege and work product. If the state law is more protective (such as where the state law is that an inadvertent disclosure can never be a waiver), the holder of the privilege or protection may well have relied on that law when making the disclosure in the state proceeding. Moreover, applying a more restrictive federal law of waiver could impair the state objective of preserving the privilege or work-product protection for disclosures made in state proceedings. On the other hand, if the federal law is more protective, applying the state law of waiver to determine admissibility in federal court is likely to undermine the federal objective of limiting the costs of production.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not address the enforceability of a state court confidentiality order in a federal proceeding, as that question is covered both by statutory law and principles of federalism and comity. <em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;1738 (providing that state judicial proceedings &ldquo;shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from which they are taken&rdquo;). <em>See also Tucker v. Ohtsu Tire & Rubber Co.</em>, 191 F.R.D. 495, 499 (D.Md. 2000) (noting that a federal court considering the enforceability of a state confidentiality order <!-- PDFPage:369 -->is &ldquo;constrained by principles of comity, courtesy, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. federalism&rdquo;). Thus, a state court order finding no waiver in connection with a disclosure made in a state court proceeding is enforceable under existing law in subsequent federal proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Confidentiality orders are becoming increasingly important in limiting the costs of privilege review and retention, especially in cases involving electronic discovery. But the utility of a confidentiality order in reducing discovery costs is substantially diminished if it provides no protection outside the particular litigation in which the order is entered. Parties are unlikely to be able to reduce the costs of pre-production review for privilege and work product if the consequence of disclosure is that the communications or information could be used by non-parties to the litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is some dispute on whether a confidentiality order entered in one case is enforceable in other proceedings. <em>See generally Hopson v. City of Baltimore</em>, 232 F.R.D. 228 (D.Md. 2005), for a discussion of this case law. The rule provides that when a confidentiality order governing the consequences of disclosure in that case is entered in a federal proceeding, its terms are enforceable against non-parties in any federal or state proceeding. For example, the court order may provide for return of documents without waiver irrespective of the care taken by the disclosing party; the rule contemplates enforcement of &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; and &ldquo;quick peek&rdquo; arrangements as a way to avoid the excessive costs of pre-production review for privilege and work product. <em>See Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC</em>, 216 F.R.D. 280, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (noting that parties may enter into &ldquo;so-called &lsquo;claw-back&rsquo; agreements that allow the parties to forego privilege review altogether in favor of an agreement to return inadvertently produced privilege documents&rdquo;). The rule provides a party with a predictable protection from a court order&mdash;predictability that is needed to allow the party to plan in advance to limit the prohibitive costs of privilege and work product review and retention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the rule, a confidentiality order is enforceable whether or not it memorializes an agreement among the parties to the litigation. Party agreement should not be a condition of enforceability of a federal court's order.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (d), a federal court may order that disclosure of privileged or protected information &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; a federal proceeding does not result in waiver. But subdivision (d) does not allow the federal court to enter an order determining the waiver effects of a separate disclosure of the same information in other proceedings, state or federal. If a disclosure has been made in a state proceeding (and is not the subject of a state-court order on waiver), then subdivision (d) is inapplicable. Subdivision (c) would govern the federal court's determination whether the state-court disclosure waived the privilege or protection in the federal proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Subdivision (e) codifies the well-established proposition that parties can enter an agreement to limit the effect of waiver by disclosure between or among them. Of course such an agreement can bind only the parties to the agreement. The rule makes clear that if parties want protection against non-parties from a finding of waiver by disclosure, the agreement must be made part of a court order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. The protections against waiver provided by Rule 502 must be applicable when protected communications or information disclosed in federal proceedings are subsequently offered in state proceedings. Otherwise the holders of protected communications and information, and their lawyers, could not rely on the protections provided by the Rule, and the goal of limiting costs in discovery would be substantially undermined. Rule 502(f) is intended to resolve any potential tension between the provisions of Rule 502 that apply to state proceedings and the possible limitations on the applicability of the Federal Rules of Evidence otherwise provided by Rules 101 and 1101.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is intended to apply in all federal court proceedings, including court-annexed and court-ordered arbitrations, without regard to any possible limitations of Rules 101 and 1101. This provision is not intended to raise an inference about the applicability of any other rule of evidence in arbitration proceedings more generally.</p>
<p class="note-body">The costs of discovery can be equally high for state and federal causes of action, and the rule seeks to limit those costs in all federal proceedings, regardless of whether the claim arises under state or federal law. Accordingly, the rule applies to state law causes of action brought in federal court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. The rule's coverage is limited to attorney-client privilege and work product. The operation of waiver by disclosure, as applied to other evidentiary privileges, remains a question of federal common law. Nor does the rule purport to apply to the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of work product &ldquo;materials&rdquo; is intended to include both tangible and intangible information. <em>See In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig.</em>, 343 F.3d 658, 662 (3d Cir. 2003) (&ldquo;work product protection extends to both tangible and intangible work product&rdquo;).</p>

L. 110&ndash;322, Sept. 19, 2008, 122 Stat. 3537), the Judicial Conference agreed to augment its note to the new rule with an addendum that contained a &ldquo;Statement of Congressional Intent Regarding Rule 502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.&rdquo; The Congressional statement can be found on pages H7818&ndash;H7819 of the Congressional Record, vol. 154 (September 8, 2008).]</p>
