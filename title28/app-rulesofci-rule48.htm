<p class="statutory-body">The court shall seat a jury of not fewer than six and not more than twelve members and all jurors shall participate in the verdict unless excused from service by the court pursuant to Rule 47(c). Unless the parties otherwise stipulate, (1) the verdict shall be unanimous and (2) no verdict shall be taken from a jury reduced in size to fewer than six members.</p>

<p class="note-body">For provisions in state codes, compare Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933) &sect;48&ndash;O&ndash;5 (In civil cases parties may agree in open court on lesser number of jurors); 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;323 (Parties may consent to any number of jurors not less than three).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The former rule was rendered obsolete by the adoption in many districts of local rules establishing six as the standard size for a civil jury.</p>
<p class="note-body">It appears that the minimum size of a jury consistent with the Seventh Amendment is six. <em>Cf. Ballew v. Georgia</em>, 435 U.S. 223 (1978) (holding that a conviction based on a jury of less than six is a denial of due process of law). If the parties agree to trial before a smaller jury, a verdict can be taken, but the parties should not other than in exceptional circumstances be encouraged to waive the right to a jury of six, not only because of the constitutional stature of the right, but also because smaller juries are more erratic and less effective in serving to distribute responsibility for the exercise of judicial power.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:218 --><p class="note-body">Because the institution of the alternate juror has been abolished by the proposed revision of Rule 47, it will ordinarily be prudent and necessary, in order to provide for sickness or disability among jurors, to seat more than six jurors. The use of jurors in excess of six increases the representativeness of the jury and harms no interest of a party. <em>Ray v. Parkside Surgery Center</em>, 13 F.R. Serv. 585 (6th cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court takes the precaution of seating a jury larger than six, an illness occurring during the deliberation period will not result in a mistrial, as it did formerly, because all seated jurors will participate in the verdict and a sufficient number will remain to render a unanimous verdict of six or more.</p>
<p class="note-body">In exceptional circumstances, as where a jury suffers depletions during trial and deliberation that are greater than can reasonably be expected, the parties may agree to be bound by a verdict rendered by fewer than six jurors. The court should not, however, rely upon the availability of such an agreement, for the use of juries smaller than six is problematic for reasons fully explained in <em>Ballew v. Georgia</em>, supra.</p>
