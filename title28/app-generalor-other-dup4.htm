<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Required Disclosures; Methods to Discover Additional Matter.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Initial Disclosures.</strong> Except in categories of proceedings specified in RCFC 26(a)(1)(E), or to the extent otherwise stipulated or directed by order, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to other parties:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment, identifying the subjects of the information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> a copy of, or a description by category and location of, all documents, data compilations, and tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party and that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> a computation of any category of damages claimed by the disclosing party, making available for inspection and copying as under RCFC 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, not privileged or protected from disclosure, on which such computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> The following categories of proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure under RCFC 26(a)(1):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(i)</strong> an action for review on an administrative record, including procurement protest and military pay cases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ii)</strong> [Not used.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iii)</strong> an action brought without counsel by a person in custody of the United States, a state, or a state subdivision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iv, v, vi and vii)</strong> [Not used.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(viii)</strong> an action to enforce an arbitration award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ix)</strong> an action under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">These disclosures must be made within 14 days after the filing of the Joint Preliminary Status <!-- PDFPage:424 -->Report (see Appendix A &nbsp;4) unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during the Early Meeting of Counsel (see Appendix A &nbsp;3) that initial disclosures are not appropriate in the circumstances of the action and states the objection in the Joint Preliminary Status Report. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures&mdash;if any&mdash;are to be made, and set the time for disclosure. Any party first served or otherwise joined after the Joint Preliminary Status Report must make these disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order. A party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it and is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully completed its investigation of the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Disclosure of Expert Testimony.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> In addition to the disclosures required by paragraph (1), a party shall disclose to other parties the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present evidence under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Except as otherwise stipulated or directed by the court, this disclosure shall, with respect to a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony, be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the witness. The report shall contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor; the data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions; any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions; the qualifications of the witness, including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the preceding ten years; the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony; and a listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within the preceding four years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> These disclosures shall be made at the times and in the sequence directed by the court. In the absence of other directions from the court or stipulation by the parties, see Appendix A &nbsp;5, 8, the disclosures shall be made at least 70 days before the scheduled close of discovery or, if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under paragraph (2)(B), within 30 days after the disclosure made by the other party. The parties shall supplement these disclosures when required under subdivision (e)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Pretrial Disclosures.</strong> [Not used. See Appendix A &nbsp;13, 15, 16.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Form of Disclosures.</strong> Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under RCFC 26(a)(1) through (3) must be made in writing, signed, and served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Methods to Discover Additional Matter.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property under RCFC 34 or 45(a)(1)(C), for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discovery Scope and Limits.</strong> Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) In General.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. All discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by RCFC 26(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Limitations.</strong> By order, the court may alter the limits in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or the length of depositions under RCFC 30. By order, the court may also limit the number of requests under RCFC 36. The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties&rsquo; resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues. The court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion under RCFC 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Trial Preparation: Materials.</strong> Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)(4), a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the <!-- PDFPage:425 -->required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party. Upon request, a person not a party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that person. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement previously made is (A) a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or (B) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Trial Preparation: Experts.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. If a report from the expert is required under subdivision (a)(2)(B), the deposition shall not be conducted until after the report is provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> A party may, through interrogatories or by deposition, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial only as provided in RCFC 35(b) or upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> Unless manifest injustice would result, (i) the court shall require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to the discovery under this subdivision; and (ii) with respect to discovery obtained under subdivision (b)(4)(B) of this rule the court shall require the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Claims of Privilege or Protection of Trial Preparation Materials.</strong> When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable under these rules by claiming that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation material, the party shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protective Orders.</strong> Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, accompanied by a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> that the disclosure or discovery not be had;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> that the disclosure or discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to certain matters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> that discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> that a deposition, after being sealed, be opened only by order of the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a designated way; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(8)</strong> that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or other person provide or permit discovery. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Timing and Sequence of Discovery.</strong> Except in categories of proceedings exempted from initial disclosure under RCFC 26(a)(1)(E), or when authorized under these rules or by order or agreement of the parties, a party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Appendix A &nbsp;3. Unless the court upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any sequence, and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, does not operate to delay any other party's discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Supplementation of Disclosures and Responses.</strong> A party who has made a disclosure under subdivision (a) or responded to a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party is under a duty to supplement at appropriate intervals its disclosures under subdivision (a) if the party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing. With respect to testimony of an expert from whom a report is required under subdivision (a)(2)(B) the duty extends both to information con<!-- PDFPage:426 -->tained in the report and to information provided through a deposition of the expert.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Conference of Parties; Planning for Discovery.</strong> [Not used. See Appendix A &nbsp;3.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Signing of Disclosures, Discovery Requests, Responses, and Objections.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Every disclosure made pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) or Appendix A &nbsp;13, 15, and 16 shall be signed by the attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. An unrepresented party shall sign the disclosure and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the disclosure is complete and correct as of the time it is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Every discovery request, response, or objection made by a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by the attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. An unrepresented party shall sign the request, response, or objection and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, response, or objection is:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> If without substantial justification a certification is made in violation of the rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose behalf the disclosure, request, response, or objection is made, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 26 has been revised to parallel the structure and content of its counterpart in the FRCP. The limited number of changes to the current FRCP, as amended in 2000, reflect those deemed necessary to accommodate the nature and jurisdiction of this court. Except for these changes, the rule shown conforms fully to the text of FRCP 26. Because the Appendix A Early Meeting of Counsel substantially accomplishes the same purpose as the FRCP 26(f) Confererence of Parties, the timing of initial disclosures was keyed to the former. Consequently, in lieu of the language of FRCP 26(f), cross reference is made to Appendix A &nbsp;3.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 27. Depositions Before Action or Pending Appeal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Before Action.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Petition.</strong> A person who desires to perpetuate testimony regarding any matter that may be cognizable in the court may file a verified petition. The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and shall show: 1, that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action cognizable in the court but is presently unable to bring it or cause it to be brought, 2, the subject matter of the expected action and the petitioner's interest therein, 3, the facts which the petitioner desires to establish by the proposed testimony and the reasons for desiring to perpetuate it, 4, [Not used.], and 5, the names and addresses of the persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the petitioner expects to elicit from each, and shall ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to take the depositions of the persons to be examined named in the petition, for the purpose of perpetuating their testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Notice and Service.</strong> The petition shall be served upon the United States in the same manner as a complaint. See RCFC 4. The petitioner may thereafter, by motion served upon counsel for the United States (see RCFC 5), request a hearing or the court may, <em>sua sponte</em>, by order, set a hearing on the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Order and Examination.</strong> If the court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, it shall make an order designating or describing the persons whose depositions may be taken and specifying the subject matter of the examination and whether the depositions shall be taken upon oral examination or written interrogatories. The depositions may then be taken in accordance with these rules; and the court may make orders of the character provided for by RCFC 34 and 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Use of Deposition.</strong> If a deposition to perpetuate testimony is taken under these rules, <!-- PDFPage:427 -->it may be used in any action involving the same subject matter subsequently brought in this court, in accordance with the provisions of RCFC 32(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pending Appeal.</strong> If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of the court or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the court may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in this court. In such case the party who desires to perpetuate the testimony may make a motion for leave to take the depositions, upon the same notice and service thereof as if the action was pending in this court. The motion shall show (1) the names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the party expects to elicit from each; (2) the reasons for perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by RCFC 34 and 35, and thereupon the depositions may be taken and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in these rules for depositions taken in actions pending in this court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 28. Persons Before Whom Depositions May Be Taken</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Within the United States.</strong> Within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held, or before a person appointed by the court. A person so appointed has power to administer oaths and take testimony. The term officer as used in RCFC 30, 31 and 32 includes a person appointed by the court or designated by the parties under RCFC 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) In Foreign Countries.</strong> Depositions may be taken in a foreign country (1) pursuant to any applicable treaty or convention, or (2) pursuant to a letter of request (whether or not captioned a letter rogatory), or (3) on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place where the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the United States, or (4) before a person commissioned by the court, and a person so commissioned shall have the power by virtue of the commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony. A commission or a letter of request shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter of request that the taking of the deposition in any other manner is impracticable or inconvenient; and both a commission and a letter of request may be issued in proper cases. A notice or commission may designate the person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive title. A letter of request may be addressed &ldquo;To the Appropriate Authority in [here name the country].&rdquo; When a letter of request or any other device is used pursuant to any applicable treaty or convention, it shall be captioned in the form prescribed by that treaty or convention. Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States under these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Disqualification for Interest.</strong> No deposition shall be taken before a person who is a relative or employee or attorney or counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of such attorney or counsel, or is financially interested in the action.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 30. Depositions Upon Oral Examination</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Depositions May Be Taken; When Leave Required.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon oral examination without leave of court except as provided in paragraph (2). The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by subpoena as provided in RCFC 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party must obtain leave of court, which shall be granted to the extent consistent with the principles stated in RCFC 26(b)(2), if the person to be examined is confined in prison or if, without the written stipulation of the parties,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> a proposed deposition would result in more than ten depositions being taken under this rule or RCFC 31 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by third-party defendants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the person to be examined already has been deposed in the case; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> a party seeks to take a deposition before the time specified in RCFC 26(d) unless <!-- PDFPage:428 -->the notice contains a certification, with supporting facts, that the person to be examined is expected to leave the United States and be unavailable for examination in this country unless deposed before that time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Notice of Examination: General Requirements; Method of Recording; Production of Documents and Things; Deposition of Organization; Deposition by Telephone.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination shall give reasonable notice in writing to every other party to the action. The notice shall state the time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the designation of the materials to be produced as set forth in the subpoena shall be attached to, or included in, the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The party taking the deposition shall state in the notice the method by which the testimony shall be recorded. Unless the court orders otherwise, it may be recorded by sound, sound-and-visual, or stenographic means, and the party taking the deposition shall bear the cost of the recording. Any party may arrange for a transcription to be made from the recording of a deposition taken by non-stenographic means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method to record the deponent's testimony in addition to the method specified by the person taking the deposition. The additional record or transcript shall be made at that party's expense unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a deposition shall be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under RCFC 28 and shall begin with a statement on the record by the officer that includes (A) the officer's name and business address; (B) the date, time, and place of the deposition; (C) the name of the deponent; (D) the administration of the oath or affirmation to the deponent; and (E) an identification of all persons present. If the deposition is recorded other than stenographically, the officer shall repeat items (A) through (C) at the beginning of each unit of recorded tape or other recording medium. The appearance or demeanor of deponents or attorneys shall not be distorted through camera or sound-recording techniques. At the end of the deposition, the officer shall state on the record that the deposition is complete and shall set forth any stipulations made by counsel concerning the custody of the transcript or recording and the exhibits, or concerning other pertinent matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request made in compliance with RCFC 34 for the production of documents and tangible things at the taking of the deposition. The procedure of RCFC 34 shall apply to the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> A party may in the party's notice and in a subpoena name as the deponent a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency and describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In that event, the organization so named shall designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated, the matters on which the person will testify. A subpoena shall advise a non-party organization of its duty to make such a designation. The persons so designated shall testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the organization. This subdivision (b)(6) does not preclude taking a deposition by any other procedure authorized in these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> The parties may stipulate in writing or the court may upon motion order that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote electronic means. For the purposes of this rule and RCFC 28(a), a deposition taken by such means is taken at the place where the deponent is to answer questions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Examination and Cross-Examination; Record of Examination; Oath; Objections.</strong> Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted at the trial under the provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence except Rules 103 and 615. The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall personally, or by someone acting under the officer's direction and in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically or recorded by any other method authorized by subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, to the manner of taking it, to the evidence presented, to the conduct of any party, or to any other aspect of the proceedings shall be noted by the officer upon the record of the deposition; but the examination shall proceed, with the testimony being taken subject to the objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition and the party taking the deposition shall transmit them to the officer, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Schedule and Duration; Motion to Terminate or Limit Examination.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any objection during a deposition must be stated concisely and in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation directed by the court, or to present a motion under RCFC 30(d)(4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Unless otherwise authorized by the court or stipulated by the parties, a deposition is limited to one day of seven hours. The court must allow additional time consistent with RCFC 26(b)(2) if needed for a fair examination of the deponent or if the deponent or another person, or other circumstance, impedes or delays the examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> If the court finds that any impediment, delay, or other conduct has frustrated the fair <!-- PDFPage:429 -->examination of the deponent, it may impose upon the persons responsible an appropriate sanction, including the reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred by any parties as a result thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> At any time during the deposition, on motion of a party or of the deponent and upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, the court may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the deposition as provided in RCFC 26(c). If the order made terminates the examination, it may be resumed thereafter only upon the order of the court. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for an order. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Review by Witness; Changes; Signing.</strong> If requested by the deponent or a party before completion of the deposition, the deponent shall have 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which to review the transcript or recording and, if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement reciting such changes and the reasons given by the deponent for making them. The officer shall indicate in the certificate prescribed by subdivision (f)(1) whether any review was requested and, if so, shall append any changes made by the deponent during the period allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Certification and Delivery by Officer; Exhibits; Copies.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The officer must certify that the witness was duly sworn by the officer and that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by the witness. This certificate must be in writing and accompany the record of the deposition. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the officer must securely seal the deposition in an envelope or package indorsed with the title of the action and marked &ldquo;Deposition of [here insert name of witness]&rdquo; and must promptly send it to the attorney who arranged for the transcript or recording, who must store it under conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration. Documents and things produced for inspection during the examination of the witness must, upon the request of a party, be marked for identification and annexed to the deposition and may be inspected and copied by any party, except that if the person producing the materials desires to retain them the person may (A) offer copies to be marked for identification and annexed to the deposition and to serve thereafter as originals if the person affords to all parties fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparison with the originals, or (B) offer the originals to be marked for identification, after giving to each party an opportunity to inspect and copy them, in which event the materials may then be used in the same manner as if annexed to the deposition. Any party may move for an order that the original be annexed to and returned with the deposition to the court, pending final disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Unless otherwise ordered by the court or agreed by the parties, the officer shall retain stenographic notes of any deposition taken stenographically or a copy of the recording of any deposition taken by another method. Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the officer shall furnish a copy of the transcript or other recording of the deposition to any party or to the deponent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Failure to Attend or to Serve Subpoena; Expenses.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party attends in person or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by that party and that party's attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition of a witness fails to serve a subpoena upon the witness and the witness because of such failure does not attend, and if another party attends in person or by attorney because that party expects the deposition of that witness to be taken, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by that party and that party's attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Serving Questions; Notice.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon written questions without leave of court except as provided in paragraph (2). The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by the use of subpoena as provided in RCFC 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party must obtain leave of court, which shall be granted to the extent consistent with the principles stated in RCFC 26(b)(2), if the person to be examined is confined in prison or if, without the written stipulation of the parties,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> a proposed deposition would result in more than ten depositions being taken under this rule or RCFC 30 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by third-party defendants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the person to be examined has already been deposed in the case; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> a party seeks to take a deposition before the time specified in RCFC 26(d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> A party desiring to take a deposition upon written questions shall serve them upon <!-- PDFPage:430 -->every other party with a notice stating (1) the name and address of the person who is to answer them, if known, and if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs, and (2) the name or descriptive title and address of the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken. A deposition upon written questions may be taken of a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency in accordance with the provisions of RCFC 30(b)(6).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 32. Use of Depositions in Court Proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Use of Depositions.</strong> At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person designated under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership or association or governmental agency which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> that the witness is dead; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> that the witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> upon application and notice, that the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing, unless the court also finds (i) that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition or (ii) that it is not in the interest of justice, with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(F)</strong> upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A deposition taken without leave of court pursuant to a notice under RCFC 30(a)(2)(C) shall not be used against a party who demonstrates that, when served with the notice, it was unable through the exercise of diligence to obtain counsel to represent it at the taking of the deposition; nor shall a deposition be used against a party who, having received less than 11 days notice of a deposition, has promptly upon receiving such notice filed a motion for a protective order under RCFC 26(c)(2) requesting that the deposition not be held or be held at a different time or place and such motion is pending at the time the deposition is held.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Substitution of parties pursuant to RCFC 25 does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken; and, when an action has been brought in any court of the United States or of any state and another action involving the same subject matter is afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken therefor. A deposition previously taken may also be used as permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Objections to Admissibility.</strong> Subject to the provisions of RCFC 28(b) and subdivision (d)(3) of this rule, objection may be made at the trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Form of Presentation.</strong> Except as otherwise directed by the court, a party offering deposi<!-- PDFPage:431 -->tion testimony pursuant to this rule may offer it in stenographic or nonstenographic form, but, if in nonstenographic form, the party shall also provide the court with a transcript of the portions so offered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Errors and Irregularities in Depositions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) As to Notice.</strong> All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) As to Disqualification of Officer.</strong> Objection to taking a deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) As to Taking of Deposition.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> Objections to the form of written questions submitted under RCFC 31 are waived unless served in writing upon the party propounding them within the time allowed for serving the succeeding cross or other questions and within 5 days after service of the last questions authorized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) As to Completion and Return of Deposition.</strong> Errors and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, transmitted, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under RCFC 30 and 31 are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 33. Interrogatories to Parties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Availability.</strong> Without leave of court or written stipulation, any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories, not exceeding 25 in number including all discrete subparts, to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Leave to serve additional interrogatories shall be granted to the extent consistent with the principles of RCFC 26(b)(2). Without leave of court or written stipulation, interrogatories may not be served before the time specified in RCFC 26(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Answers and Objections.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the objecting party shall state the reasons for objection and shall answer to the extent the interrogatory is not objectionable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections signed by the attorney making them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories. A shorter or longer time may be directed by the court or, in the absence of such an order, agreed to in writing by the parties subject to RCFC 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> All grounds for an objection to an interrogatory shall be stated with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the party's failure to object is excused by the court for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> The party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under RCFC 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Scope; Use at Trial.</strong> Interrogatories may relate to any matters which can be inquired into under RCFC 26(b)(1), and the answers may be used to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has been completed or until a pretrial conference or other later time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Option to Produce Business Records.</strong> Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit or inspection of such business records, including a compilation, abstract or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party <!-- PDFPage:432 -->serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts or summaries. A specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Scope.</strong> Any party may serve on any other party a request (1) to produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on the requestor's behalf, to inspect and copy, any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, phonorecords, and other data compilations from which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, by the respondent through detection devices into reasonably usable form), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which constitute or contain matters within the scope of RCFC 26(b) and which are in the possession, custody or control of the party upon whom the request is served; or (2) to permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon, within the scope of RCFC 26(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure.</strong> The request shall set forth, either by individual item or by category, the items to be inspected, and describe each with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts. Without leave of court or written stipulation, a request may not be served before the time specified in RCFC 26(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 30 days after the service of the request. A shorter or longer time may be directed by the court or, in the absence of such an order, agreed to by the parties, subject to RCFC 29. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified and inspection permitted of the remaining parts. The party submitting the request may move for an order under RCFC 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Persons Not Parties.</strong> A person not a party to the action may be compelled to produce documents and things or to submit to an inspection as provided in RCFC 45.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 35. Physical and Mental Examinations of Persons</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Order for Examination.</strong> When the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party's custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Report of Examiner.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> If requested by the party against whom an order is made under RCFC 35(a) or the person examined, the party causing the examination to be made shall deliver to the requesting party a copy of the detailed written report of the examiner setting out the examiner's findings, including results of all tests made, diagnoses and conclusions, together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. After delivery the party causing the examination shall be entitled upon request to receive from the party against whom the order is made a like report of any examination, previously or thereafter made, of the same condition, unless, in the case of a report of examination of a person not a party, the party shows that the party is unable to obtain it. The court on motion may make an order against a party requiring delivery of a report on such terms as are just, and if an examiner fails or refuses to make a report the court may exclude the examiner's testimony if offered at trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> By requesting and obtaining a report of the examination so ordered or by taking the deposition of the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege the party may have in that action or any other involving the same controversy, regarding the testimony of every other person who has examined or may thereafter examine the party in respect of the same mental or physical condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> This subdivision applies to examinations made by agreement of the parties, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. This subdivision does not preclude discovery of a report of an examiner or the taking of a deposition of the examiner in accordance with the provisions of any other rule.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 36. Requests for Admission</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Request for Admission.</strong> A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the <!-- PDFPage:433 -->admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of RCFC 26(b)(1) set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any documents described in the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. Without leave of court or written stipulation, requests for admission may not be served before the time specified in RCFC 26(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow or as the parties may agree to in writing, subject to RCFC 29, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or by the party's attorney. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless the party states that the party has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; the party may, subject to the provisions of RCFC 37(c), deny the matter or set forth reasons why the party cannot admit or deny it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the court determines that an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer be served. If the court determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court may, in lieu of these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be made at a pre-trial conference or at a designated time prior to trial. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Effect of Admission.</strong> Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Subject to the provision of RCFC 16 governing amendment of a pre-trial order, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission by the party for any other purpose nor may it be used against the party in any other proceeding.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 37. Failure to Make Disclosure or Cooperate in Discovery; Sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Motion for Order Compelling Disclosure or Discovery.</strong> A party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby, may apply for an order compelling disclosure or discovery as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Appropriate Court.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Motion.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> If a party fails to make a disclosure required by RCFC 26(a), any other party may move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party not making the disclosure in an effort to secure the disclosure without court action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or submitted under RCFC 30 or 31, or a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a), or a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under RCFC 33, or if a party, in response to a request for inspection submitted under RCFC 34, fails to respond that inspection will be permitted as requested or fails to permit inspection as requested, the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer, or a designation, or an order compelling inspection in accordance with the request. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make the discovery in an effort to secure the information or material without court action. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the examination before applying for an order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response.</strong> For purposes of this subdivision an evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response is to be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Expenses and Sanctions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> If the motion is granted or if the disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the motion was filed, the court shall, after affording an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion or the party or attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds that the motion was filed with<!-- PDFPage:434 -->out the movant's first making a good faith effort to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action, or that the opposing party's nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified, or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> If the motion is denied, the court may enter any protective order authorized under RCFC 26(c) and shall, after affording an opportunity to be heard, require the moving party or the attorney filing the motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may enter any protective order authorized under RCFC 26(c) and may, after affording an opportunity to be heard, apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure to Comply With Order.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Sanctions Concerning Deponents.</strong> If a deponent fails to be sworn or to answer a question after being directed to do so by the court, the failure may be considered a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Sanctions Concerning Parties.</strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of this rule or RCFC 35, or if a party fails to obey an order entered under RCFC 16(b), the court may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> An order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting that party from introducing designated matters in evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, an order treating as a contempt of court the failure to obey any orders except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> Where a party has failed to comply with an order under RCFC 35(a) requiring the party to produce another for examination, such orders as are listed in paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of this subdivision, unless the party failing to comply shows that that party is unable to produce such person for examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Failure to Disclose; False or Misleading Disclosure; Refusal to Admit.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by RCFC 26(a) or 26(e)(1), or to amend a prior response to discovery as required by RCFC 26(e)(2), is not, unless such failure is harmless, permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed. In addition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions. In addition to requiring payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, these sanctions may include any of the actions authorized under RCFC 37(b)(2)(A), (B), and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested under RCFC 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, the requesting party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (A) the request was held objectionable pursuant to RCFC 36(a), or (B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (C) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, or (D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Failure of Party to Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers to Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection.</strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails (1) to appear before the officer who is to take the deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or (2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted under RCFC 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under RCFC 34, after proper service of the request, the court in which the action is pending on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. Any motion specifying a failure under clause (2) or (3) of this subdivision shall include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party failing to answer or respond in an ef<!-- PDFPage:435 -->fort to obtain such answer or response without court action. In lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to act or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a protective order as provided by RCFC 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Subpoena of Person in Foreign Country.</strong> [Abrogated in FRCP.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Expenses Against United States.</strong> [Repealed.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Failure to Participate in the Framing of a Discovery Plan.</strong> If a party or a party's attorney fails to participate in good faith in the development and submission of a proposed discovery plan as required by Appendix A &nbsp;3, the court may, after opportunity for hearing, require such party or attorney to pay to any other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure.</p>
