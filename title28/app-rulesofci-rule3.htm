<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. Rule 5(e) defines what constitutes filing with the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This rule governs the commencement of all actions, including those brought by or against the United States or an officer or agency thereof, regardless of whether service is to be made personally pursuant to Rule 4(d), or otherwise pursuant to Rule 4(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">3. With this rule compare [former] Equity Rule 12 (Issue of Subpoena&mdash;Time for Answer) and the following statutes (and other similar statutes) which provide a similar method for commencing an action:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 28:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;45 [former] (District courts; practice and procedure in certain cases under interstate commerce laws).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;762 [see 1402] (Petition in suit against United States).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;766 [see 2409] (Partition suits where United States is tenant in common or joint tenant).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body">4. This rule provides that the first step in an action is the filing of the complaint. Under Rule 4(a) this is to be followed forthwith by issuance of a summons and its delivery to an officer for service. Other rules providing for dismissal for failure to prosecute suggest a method available to attack unreasonable delay in prosecuting an action after it has been commenced. When a Federal or State statute of limitations is pleaded as a defense, a question may arise under this rule whether the mere filing of the complaint stops the running of the statute, or whether any further step is required, such as, service of the summons and complaint or their delivery to the marshal for service. The answer to this question may depend on whether it is competent for the Supreme Court, exercising the power to make rules of procedure without affecting substantive rights, to vary the operation of statutes of limitations. The requirement of Rule 4(a) that the clerk shall forthwith issue the summons and deliver it to the marshal for service will reduce the chances of such a question arising.</p>
