Motions for enlargement of time must include a representation that the moving party has discussed the motion with opposing counsel and a statement indicating whether an opposition will be filed or, if opposing counsel cannot be consulted, an explanation of the efforts that were made to do so.</p>

<p class="note-body">New RCFC 6.1 has no FRCP counterpart. The text of the new rule formerly appeared in these rules as part of RCFC 6(b). However, the language in former RCFC 6(b) which addressed the content of the reasons offered in support of a motion for enlargement of time has been stricken as unnecessary.</p>
