<h3 class="section-head">Rule 41. Dismissal of Actions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Voluntary Dismissal&mdash;Effect Thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) By Plaintiff&mdash;By Stipulation. Subject to the provisions of Rule 23(e), of Rule 56.2, of Rule 66, and of any statute of the United States, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (A) by filing a notice of dismissal which shall be substantially in the form set forth in Form 7 of the Appendix of Forms at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or motion for summary judgment, whichever occurs first, or (B) by filing a stipulation of dismissal, which shall be substantially in the form set forth in Form 8 of the Appendix of Forms, signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States or of any state an action based on or including the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) By Order of Court. Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision (a), an action shall not be dismissed by the plaintiff unless upon order of the court, and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon the defendant of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Involuntary Dismissal&mdash;Effect Thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Actions on the Reserve Calendar or the Suspension Disposition Calendar are subject to dismissal for lack of prosecution at the expiration of the applicable period of time as prescribed by Rules 83 and 85.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Actions commenced pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c) by the filing of a summons only are subject to dismissal for failure to file a complaint at the expiration of the applicable period of time prescribed by 19 U.S.C. &sect;1516a.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever it appears that an action is not being prosecuted with due diligence, the court may upon its own initiative after notice, or upon motion of a defendant, order the action dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For failure of the plaintiff to comply with these rules or with any order of the court, a defendant may move that the action be dismissed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A dismissal under this subdivision (b) operates as a dismissal upon the merits, unless the court otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Insufficiency of Evidence. After the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of evidence, the defendant, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. If the court renders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff, the judgment shall be supported by either a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law or an opinion stating the reasons and facts upon which the judgment is based. A dismissal under this subdivision (c) operates as a dismissal upon the merits, unless the court otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Dismissal of Counterclaim, Cross-Claim, or Third-Party Claim. The provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim. A voluntary dismissal by the claimant alone pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of this rule shall be made before a responsive pleading is served or, if there is none, before the introduction of evidence at the trial or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Costs of Previously Dismissed Action. If a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action in any court commences an action based upon or including the same claim against the same defendant, the court may make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it may deem proper and may stay the proceedings in the action until the plaintiff has complied with the order.</p>
