<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Definition&mdash;Form. &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Demand for Judgment. A judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment. Except as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party's pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Costs; Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Costs other than Attorneys&rsquo; Fees. Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs, other than attorneys&rsquo; fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs; but costs against the United States, its officers, and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law. Such costs may be taxed by the clerk on one day's notice. On motion served within 5 days thereafter, the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Claims for attorney's fees and related non-taxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive law governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court, the motion must be filed no later than 14 days after entry of judgment; must specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the moving party to the award; and must state the amount or provide a fair estimate of the amount sought. If directed by the court, the motion shall also disclose the terms of any agreement with respect to fees to be paid for the services for which claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) On request of a party or class member, the court shall afford an opportunity for adversary submissions with respect to the motion in accordance with Rule 43(c) or Rule 78. The court may determine issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions bearing <!-- PDFPage:553 -->on issues of evaluation of services for which liability is imposed by the court. The court shall find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in Rule 52(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) By court rules, the court may establish special procedures by which issues relating to such fees may be resolved without extensive evidentiary hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (4) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violations of these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Practice Comment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The USCIT Guidelines for Bill of Costs set forth in full the procedures to be followed when a prevailing party files a Bill of Costs pursuant to Rule 54(d)(1). The Guidelines shall have the same force and effect as the provisions of this Rule. The failure of a prevailing party either to timely file a Bill of Costs or to comply with these Guidelines shall constitute a waiver of any claim for costs.</p>
