<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) As a result of the population growth, the freeways connecting the Pacific coast and the inland areas are tremendously overburdened, and Federal offices along the coast are no longer accessible to the residents of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.</p>

<p class="note-body">It is consonant with the ruling of the Supreme Court in <em>O'Donoghue v.

In <em>Federal Trade Commission v.

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates the last paragraph of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with portions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the number of judges in the various districts are incorporated in section 133 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of section 863, see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception in subsection (b) &ldquo;except in the District of Columbia&rdquo; conforms with the recent decision in <em>U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher</em>, 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See reviser's note under section 44 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The clause in said last paragraph of section 1 of title 28 providing that any district judge, who violates the residence requirement, shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, was omitted. This penalty provision was attached to the residence requirement at the time of compilation of the Revised Statutes of 1878, although it is apparent that Congress only intended that the penalty should be invoked upon the unauthorized practice of law. See <em>U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher</em>, supra, in which an outline of the history of said section 1 of title 28 is given.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates portions of section 375 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11&ndash;301 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed. The provisions of said section 375 relating to resignation and retirement of judges, and appointment of court officers, are incorporated in sections 294, 371, and 756 of this title. Other provisions of said section 11&ndash;301 of the District of Columbia Code are incorporated in section 133 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a), providing for a &ldquo;chief judge&rdquo; is new. Such term replaces the terms &ldquo;senior district judge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chief Justice&rdquo; of the District Court in the District of Columbia. It is employed in view of the great increase of administrative duties of such judge. The use of the term &ldquo;chief judge&rdquo; with respect to the District of Columbia will result in uniform nomenclature for all district courts. The district judges of that court have expressed approval of such designation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in said section 11&ndash;301 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., that the &ldquo;Chief Justice&rdquo; shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was omitted for the purpose of establishing a uniform method of creating the position of chief judge in all districts. The District of Columbia is expressly made a judicial district by section 88 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is new and conforms with similar provisions respecting associate justices of the Supreme Court and circuit judges in sections 4 and 45 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body"> Subsection (c) is from the proviso in the second paragraph of section 375 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which applied only in cases of appointment of court officers. Here it is made applicable to all district judges.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (d) and (e) are new, and conform with section 44 of this title relating to precedence of circuit judges.</p>
<p class="note-body">The official status of the Chief Justice of the District Court for the District of Columbia holding office at the effective date of this act is preserved by section 2 of the bill to enact revised title 28.</p>
