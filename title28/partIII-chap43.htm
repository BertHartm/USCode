<p class="statutory-body">(a) The judges of each United States district court and the district courts of the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands shall appoint United States magistrate judges in such numbers and to serve at such locations within the judicial districts as the Judicial Conference may determine under this chapter. In the case of a magistrate judge appointed by the district court of the Virgin Islands, Guam, or the Northern Mariana Islands, this chapter shall apply as though the court appointing such a magistrate judge were a United States district court. Where there is more than one judge of a district court, the appointment, whether an original appointment or a reappointment, shall be by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, and when there is no such concurrence, then by the chief judge. Where the conference deems it desirable, a magistrate judge may be designated to serve in one or more districts adjoining the district for which he is appointed. Such a designation shall be made by the concurrence of a majority of the judges of each of the district courts involved and shall specify the duties to be performed by the magistrate judge in the adjoining district or districts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No individual may be appointed or reappointed to serve as a magistrate judge under this chapter unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) He has been for at least five years a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States, except that an individual who does not meet the bar membership requirements of this paragraph may be appointed and serve as a part-time magistrate judge if the appointing court or courts and the conference find that no qualified individual who is a member of the bar is available to serve at a specific location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) He is determined by the appointing district court or courts to be competent to perform the duties of the office;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of an individual appointed to serve in a national park, he resides within the exterior boundaries of that park, or at some place reasonably adjacent thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) He is not related by blood or marriage to a judge of the appointing court or courts at the time of his initial appointment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) He is selected pursuant to standards and procedures promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Such standards and procedures shall contain provision for public notice of all vacancies in magistrate judge positions and for the establishment by the district courts of merit selection panels, composed of residents of the individual judicial districts, to assist the courts in identifying and recommending persons who are best qualified to fill such positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A magistrate judge may hold no other civil or military office or employment under the United States: <em>Provided, however</em>, That, with the approval of the conference, a part-time referee in bankruptcy or a clerk or deputy clerk of a court of the United States may be appointed and serve as a part-time United States magistrate judge, but the conference shall fix the aggregate amount of compensation to be received for performing the duties of part-time magistrate judge and part-time referee in bankruptcy, clerk or deputy clerk: <em>And provided further</em>, That retired officers and retired enlisted personnel of the Regular and Reserve components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, members of the Reserve components of <!-- PDFPage:280 -->the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and members of the Army National Guard of the United States, the Air National Guard of the United States, and the Naval Militia and of the National Guard of a State, territory, or the District of Columbia, except the National Guard disbursing officers who are on a full-time salary basis, may be appointed and serve as United States magistrate judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Except as otherwise provided in sections 375 and 636(h) of this title, no individual may serve under this chapter after having attained the age of seventy years: <em>Provided, however</em>, That upon a majority vote of all the judges of the appointing court or courts, which is taken upon the magistrate judge's attaining age seventy and upon each subsequent anniversary thereof, a magistrate judge who has attained the age of seventy years may continue to serve and may be reappointed under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The appointment of any individual as a full-time magistrate judge shall be for a term of eight years, and the appointment of any individuals as a part-time magistrate judge shall be for a term of four years, except that the term of a full-time or part-time magistrate judge appointed under subsection (k)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#631_1_target" name="631_1">1</a></sup> shall expire upon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the expiration of the absent magistrate judge's term,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reinstatement of the absent magistrate judge in regular service in office as a magistrate judge,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the failure of the absent magistrate judge to make timely application under subsection (j)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#631_1_target" name="631_1">1</a></sup> of this section for reinstatement in regular service in office as a magistrate judge after discharge or release from military service,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Each individual appointed as a magistrate judge under this section shall take the oath or affirmation prescribed by section 453 of this title before performing the duties of his office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Each appointment made by a judge or judges of a district court shall be entered of record in such court, and notice of such appointment shall be given at once by the clerk of that court to the Director.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Removal of a magistrate judge during the term for which he is appointed shall be only for incompetency, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or mental disability, but a magistrate judge's office shall be terminated if the conference determines that the services performed by his office are no longer needed. Removal shall be by the judges of the district court for the judicial district in which the magistrate judge serves; where there is more than one judge of a district court, removal shall not occur unless a majority of all the judges of such court concur in the order of removal; and when there is a tie vote of the judges of the district court on the question of the removal or retention in office of a magistrate judge, then removal shall be only by a concurrence of a majority of all the judges of the council. In the case of a magistrate judge appointed under the third sentence of subsection (a) of this section, removal shall not occur unless a majority of all the judges of the appointing district courts concur in the order of removal; and where there is a tie vote on the question of the removal or retention in office of a magistrate judge, then removal shall be only by a concurrence of a majority of all the judges of the council or councils. Before any order or removal shall be entered, a full specification of the charges shall be furnished to the magistrate judge, and he shall be accorded by the judge or judges of the removing court, courts, council, or councils an opportunity to be heard on the charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Upon the grant by the appropriate district court or courts of a leave of absence to a magistrate judge entitled to such relief under chapter 43 of title 38, such court or courts may proceed to appoint, in the manner specified in subsection (a) of this section, another magistrate judge, qualified for appointment and service under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, who shall serve for the period specified in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) A United States magistrate judge appointed under this chapter shall be exempt from the provisions of subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 526 and a portion of 527, both of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with provisions of sections 27, 66, 80e, 100, 117e, 129, 172, 198e, 204e, 256d, 395e, 403c&ndash;5, 403h&ndash;5, 404c&ndash;5 and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to appointment of United States commissioners. For other provisions of said sections see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some of the provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions were retained in that title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of sections 395e, 403c&ndash;5, 404c&ndash;5, and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for appointment of the Park Commissioner in the Hawaii National Park, Shenandoah National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Mammoth Cave National Park and Isle Royale National Park upon &ldquo;the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior&rdquo; was omitted as inconsistent not only with other provisions of this title but with other statutes applicable to other national parks.</p>
<p class="note-body">All such park commissioners are United States commissioners and the revision of these sections makes possible uniformity and consistency in administrative matters concerning such commissioners. (See, also, sections 604 and 634 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., in view of the general supervision by the Director over clerks and commissioners under section 601 et seq. of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">See, also, section 751 of this title prohibiting clerks from receiving compensation in another capacity.</p>
<p class="note-body">First sentence of subsection (b) was substituted for the provision in section 527 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., prohibiting specified persons from acting as commissioners.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;at such places in the district as may be designated by the district court,&rdquo; in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that commissioners should have the same powers and duties as are conferred and imposed by law, was omitted as superfluous.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase in sections 526 and 527 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;except as provided in section 591&rdquo; and section 591, the effect of which was to except Alaska from this section, were omitted as unnecessary. This revised section by its terms limits the section and chapter 43 of this title to commissioners appointed by a &ldquo;district court,&rdquo; which includes the courts enumerated in chapter 5 of this title but not those of Alaska, Canal Zone, or Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections from title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., contained no tenure provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in phraseology were made.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Prior residence requirement for national park commissioners in section 635</em>.&mdash;Based on sections 1a and 403c&ndash;9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation (Aug. 19, 1937, ch. 703, &sect;8, 50 Stat. 702; June 28, 1938, ch. 778, &sect;1, 52 Stat. 1213).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 1a with part of section 403c&ndash;9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to residence of a national park commissioner.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of sections 1a and 403c&ndash;9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation by the Secretary of the Interior of some place of residence reasonably adjacent to the park was modified by making such designation subject to the approval of the appointing court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Senate Revision Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">By Senate amendment, &ldquo;Big Bend&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crater Lake&rdquo; were inserted in subsection (a) of this section, and section 158a of title 16, U.S.C., which was derived from act May 15, 1947, ch. 55, &sect;1, 61 Stat. 91, accordingly became an additional source of this section, such Act being included in the schedule of repeals. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.</p>
<p class="note-body">As finally enacted, act May 15, 1947, ch. 57, 61 Stat. 92, which amended section 403c&ndash;5 of title 16, U.S.C., became an additional source of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1949 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment conforms the language of section 631(b) to the provisions of section 35 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by the act of June 28, 1946 (&sect;3, 60 Stat. 324), that full-time referees in bankruptcy may not be appointed United States Commissioners.</p>
<p class="note-body">This amendment also removes an ambiguity from section 631(b) by making it clear that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has power to establish maximum limits of compensation to be received for performing the combined offices of commissioner and clerk or deputy clerk. This was the intent of sections 631 and 751 of title 28. (See the fifteenth paragraph of the reviser's note to the latter section, H. Rept. No. 308, April 25, 1947, p. A90, to accompany H.R. 3214, 80th Cong.)</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Surveys by the Director.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Director shall, within one year immediately following the date of the enactment of the Federal Magistrates Act, make a careful survey of conditions in judicial districts to determine (A) the number of appointments of full-time magistrates and part-time magistrates re<!-- PDFPage:285 -->quired to be made under this chapter to provide for the expeditious and effective administration of justice, (B) the locations at which such officers shall serve, and (C) their respective salaries under section 634 of this title. Thereafter, the Director shall, from time to time, make such surveys, general or local, as the conference shall deem expedient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the course of any survey, the Director shall take into account local conditions in each judicial district, including the areas and the populations to be served, the transportation and communications facilities available, the amount and distribution of business of the type expected to arise before officers appointed under this chapter (including such matters as may be assigned under section 636(b) of this chapter), and any other material factors. The Director shall give consideration to suggestions from any interested parties, including district judges, United States magistrate judges or officers appointed under this chapter, United States attorneys, bar associations, and other parties having relevant experience or information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The surveys shall be made with a view toward creating and maintaining a system of full-time United States magistrate judges. However, should the Director find, as a result of any such surveys, areas in which the employment of a full-time magistrate judge would not be feasible or desirable, he shall recommend the appointment of part-time United States magistrate judges in such numbers and at such locations as may be required to permit prompt and efficient issuance of process and to permit individuals charged with criminal offenses against the United States to be brought before a judicial officer of the United States promptly after arrest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determination by the Conference</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the completion of the initial surveys required by subsection (a) of this section, the Director shall report to the district courts, the councils, and the conference his recommendations concerning the number of full-time magistrates and part-time magistrates, their respective locations, and the amount of their respective salaries under section 634 of this title. The district courts shall advise their respective councils, stating their recommendations and the reasons therefor; the councils shall advise the conference, stating their recommendations and the reasons therefor, and shall also report to the conference the recommendations of the district courts. The conference shall determine, in the light of the recommendations of the Director, the district courts, and the councils, the number of full-time United States magistrates and part-time United States magistrates, the locations at which they shall serve, and their respective salaries. Such determinations shall take effect in each judicial district at such time as the district court for such judicial district shall determine, but in no event later than one year after they are promulgated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Changes in Number, Locations, and Salaries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the conference may, from time to time, in the light of the recommendations of the Director, the district courts, and the councils, change the number, locations, and salaries of full-time and part-time magistrate judges, as the expeditious administration of justice may require.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the power to enter a sentence for a class A misdemeanor in a case in which the parties have consented.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a judge may designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court, except a motion for injunctive relief, for judgment on the pleadings, for summary judgment, to dismiss or quash an indictment or information made by the defendant, to suppress evidence in a criminal case, to dismiss or to permit maintenance of a class action, to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and to involuntarily dismiss an action. A judge of the court may reconsider any pretrial matter under this subparagraph (A) where it has been shown that the magistrate judge's order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a judge may also designate a magistrate judge to conduct hearings, including evidentiary hearings, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any motion excepted in subparagraph (A), of applications for posttrial&nbsp;<sup><a href="#636_1_target" name="636_1">1</a></sup> relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the magistrate judge shall file his proposed findings and recommendations under subparagraph (B) with the court and a copy shall forthwith be mailed to all parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Within fourteen days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A judge may designate a magistrate judge to serve as a special master pursuant to the applicable provisions of this title and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States district courts. A judge may designate a magistrate judge to serve as a special master in any civil case, upon consent of the parties, without regard to the provisions of rule 53(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States district courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A magistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each district court shall establish rules pursuant to which the magistrate judges shall discharge their duties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon the consent of the parties, a full-time United States magistrate judge or a part-time United States magistrate judge who serves as a full-time judicial officer may conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case, when specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or courts he serves. Upon the consent of the parties, pursuant to their specific written request, any other part-time magistrate judge may exercise such jurisdic<!-- PDFPage:289 -->tion, if such magistrate judge meets the bar membership requirements set forth in section 631(b)(1) and the chief judge of the district court certifies that a full-time magistrate judge is not reasonably available in accordance with guidelines established by the judicial council of the circuit. When there is more than one judge of a district court, designation under this paragraph shall be by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, and when there is no such concurrence, then by the chief judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If a magistrate judge is designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the clerk of court shall, at the time the action is filed, notify the parties of the availability of a magistrate judge to exercise such jurisdiction. The decision of the parties shall be communicated to the clerk of court. Thereafter, either the district court judge or the magistrate judge may again advise the parties of the availability of the magistrate judge, but in so doing, shall also advise the parties that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences. Rules of court for the reference of civil matters to magistrate judges shall include procedures to protect the voluntariness of the parties&rsquo; consent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Upon entry of judgment in any case referred under paragraph (1) of this subsection, an aggrieved party may appeal directly to the appropriate United States court of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate judge in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court. The consent of the parties allows a magistrate judge designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection to direct the entry of a judgment of the district court in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as a limitation of any party's right to seek review by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The court may, for good cause shown on its own motion, or under extraordinary circumstances shown by any party, vacate a reference of a civil matter to a magistrate judge under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The magistrate judge shall, subject to guidelines of the Judicial Conference, determine whether the record taken pursuant to this section shall be taken by electronic sound recording, by a court reporter, or by other means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The practice and procedure for the trial of cases before officers serving under this chapter shall conform to rules promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to section 2072 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Summary criminal contempt authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A magistrate judge shall have the power to punish summarily by fine or imprisonment, or both, such contempt of the authority of such magistrate judge constituting misbehavior of any person in the magistrate judge's presence so as to obstruct the administration of justice. The order of contempt shall be issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Additional criminal contempt authority in civil consent and misdemeanor cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any case in which a United States magistrate judge presides with the consent of the parties under subsection (c) of this section, and in any misdemeanor case proceeding before a magistrate judge under section 3401 of title 18, the magistrate judge shall have the power to punish, by fine or imprisonment, or both, criminal contempt constituting disobedience or resistance to the magistrate judge's lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command. Disposition of such contempt shall be conducted upon notice and hearing under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Civil contempt authority in civil consent and misdemeanor cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any case in which a United States magistrate judge presides with the consent of the parties under subsection (c) of this section, and in any misdemeanor case proceeding before a magistrate judge under section 3401 of title 18, the magistrate judge may exercise the civil contempt authority of the district court. This paragraph shall not be construed to limit the authority of a magistrate judge to order sanctions under any other statute, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Criminal contempt penalties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The sentence imposed by a magistrate judge for any criminal contempt provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3) shall not exceed the penalties for a Class C misdemeanor as set forth in sections 3581(b)(8) and 3571(b)(6) of title 18.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Certification of other contempts to the district court</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the commission of any such act&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in any case in which a United States magistrate judge presides with the consent of the parties under subsection (c) of this section, or in any misdemeanor case proceeding before a magistrate judge under section 3401 of title 18, that may, in the opinion of the magistrate judge, constitute a serious criminal contempt punishable by penalties exceeding those set forth in paragraph (5) of this subsection, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in any other case or proceeding under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or any other statute, where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the act committed in the magistrate judge's presence may, in the opinion of the magistrate judge, constitute a serious criminal contempt punishable by penalties exceeding those set forth in paragraph (5) of this subsection,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the act that constitutes a criminal contempt occurs outside the presence of the magistrate judge, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the act constitutes a civil contempt,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the magistrate judge shall forthwith certify the facts to a district judge and may serve or cause to be served, upon any person whose be<!-- PDFPage:290 -->havior is brought into question under this paragraph, an order requiring such person to appear before a district judge upon a day certain to show cause why that person should not be adjudged in contempt by reason of the facts so certified. The district judge shall thereupon hear the evidence as to the act or conduct complained of and, if it is such as to warrant punishment, punish such person in the same manner and to the same extent as for a contempt committed before a district judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Appeals of magistrate judge contempt orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The appeal of an order of contempt under this subsection shall be made to the court of appeals in cases proceeding under subsection (c) of this section. The appeal of any other order of contempt issued under this section shall be made to the district court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

A magistrate judge so assigned shall not be entitled to additional compensation but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of his duties in accordance with section 635.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A United States magistrate judge may perform the verification function required by section 4107 of title 18, United States Code. A magistrate judge may be assigned by a judge of any United States district court to perform the verification required by section 4108 and the appointment of counsel authorized by section 4109 of title 18, United States Code, and may perform such functions beyond the territorial limits of the United States. A magistrate judge assigned such functions shall have no authority to perform any other function within the territory of a foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A United States magistrate judge who has retired may, upon the consent of the chief judge of the district involved, be recalled to serve as a magistrate judge in any judicial district by the judicial council of the circuit within which such district is located. Upon recall, a magistrate judge may receive a salary for such service in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference, subject to the restrictions on the payment of an annuity set forth in section 377 of this title or in subchapter III of chapter 83, and chapter 84, of title 5 which are applicable to such magistrate judge.

<p class="note-body">As finally enacted, act May 15, 1947, ch. 57, 61 Stat. 92, which amended section 403c&ndash;5 of Title 16, U.S.C., was an additional source of this section, and such act was accordingly included by Senate amendment in the schedule of repeals.

See also reviser's notes to sections 631 and 633 of this title.</p>
