<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Appendix E formerly appeared in these rules as Appendix C. Additionally, substantive changes have been made.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the word &ldquo;common&rdquo; has been stricken from the term &ldquo;common carrier.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; is no longer used in the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. &sect;13102. As a result of industry deregulation, see ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104&ndash;88, &sect;103, 109 Stat. 803, 852, carriers are no longer required to file tariffs other than for household goods and noncontiguous domestic trade. Additionally, Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity are no longer required and thus there are no &ldquo;common carriers&rdquo; in the sense in which that term formerly was used, i.e., to describe a public utility occupying fully regulated status.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, in Rule 1(b)(6), titled &ldquo;Nature of Dispute; Statement of Issues,&rdquo; the term &ldquo;General Accounting Office&rdquo; was replaced with &ldquo;General Services Administration.&rdquo; The GSA Board of Contract Appeals replaced the General Accounting Office as reviewing authority in GSA transportation audit billing appeals pursuant to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1996, effective June 30, 1996, and delegations of authority granted thereunder. Also, in Rule 1(b)(6), the term &ldquo;contract terms&rdquo; was added as authority relied upon by plaintiffs in their statement of issues because, with no tariff filing requirement, individual movements by contract are more common.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, all references to a &ldquo;&sect;22 quotation&rdquo; were replaced with &ldquo;government rate quotation.&rdquo; Section 22 (49 U.S.C. &sect;22 (1887)) rates were replaced by &ldquo;government rates&rdquo; under 49 U.S.C. &sect;10721 (rail) and &sect;13712 (all other modes), and as such, lower rates are not limited strictly for the use of the government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, in Rule 1(b)(9)(B), the word &ldquo;government&rdquo; was struck in reference to a transportation request or warrant in dispute. Under the provisions of 41 CFR &sect;102&ndash;118.175, Government Bills of Lading will no longer be used for domestic traffic and under 41 CFR &sect;102&ndash;118.180, Government Transportation Requests will no longer be mandatory.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fifth, in Rule 2(i), titled &ldquo;Relation to Pleadings; Time for Filing Answer or Counterclaim,&rdquo; the statutory reference was updated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, in Rule 4, all references to the &ldquo;Interstate Commerce Commission&rdquo; were stricken and replaced with the &ldquo;Surface Transportation Board.&rdquo; While carriers are no longer subject to full regulation, the &ldquo;reasonableness requirement&rdquo; on &ldquo;through routes,&rdquo; &ldquo;divisions of joint rates,&rdquo; and rates &ldquo;made collectively by [any group of] carriers under agreements approved by the Surface Transportation Board,&rdquo; remains intact and is subject to that body's review.</p>
