<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure have said very little about briefing in cases involving cross-appeals. This vacuum has frustrated judges, attorneys, and parties who have sought guidance in the rules. More importantly, this vacuum has been filled by conflicting local rules regarding such matters as the number and length of briefs, the colors of the covers of briefs, and the deadlines for serving and filing briefs. These local rules have created a hardship for attorneys who practice in more than one circuit.</p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 28.1 provides a comprehensive set of rules governing briefing in cases involving cross-appeals. The few existing provisions regarding briefing in such cases have been moved into new Rule 28.1, and several new provisions have been added to fill the gaps in the existing rules. The new provisions reflect the practices of the large majority of circuits and, to a significant extent, the new provisions have been patterned after the requirements imposed by Rules 28, 31, and 32 on briefs filed in cases that do not involve cross-appeals.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:48 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> Subdivision (a) makes clear that, in a case involving a cross-appeal, briefing is governed by new Rule 28.1, and not by Rules 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), 31(a)(1), 32(a)(2), 32(a)(7)(A), and 32(a)(7)(B), except to the extent that Rule 28.1 specifically incorporates those rules by reference.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> Subdivision (b) defines who is the &ldquo;appellant&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;appellee&rdquo; in a case involving a cross-appeal. Subdivision (b) is taken directly from former Rule 28(h), except that subdivision (b) refers to a party being designated as an appellant &ldquo;for the purposes of this rule and Rules 30 and 34,&rdquo; whereas former Rule 28(h) also referred to Rule 31. Because the matter addressed by Rule 31(a)(1)&mdash;the time to serve and file briefs&mdash;is now addressed directly in new Rule 28.1(f), the cross-reference to Rule 31 is no longer necessary. In Rule 31 and in all rules other than Rules 28.1, 30, and 34, references to an &ldquo;appellant&rdquo; refer both to the appellant in an appeal and to the cross-appellant in a cross-appeal, and references to an &ldquo;appellee&rdquo; refer both to the appellee in an appeal and to the cross-appellee in a cross-appeal. Cf. Rule 31(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> Subdivision (c) provides for the filing of four briefs in a case involving a cross-appeal. This reflects the practice of every circuit except the Seventh. <em>See</em> 7th Cir. R. 28(d)(1)(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first brief is the &ldquo;appellant's principal brief.&rdquo; That brief&mdash;like the appellant's principal brief in a case that does not involve a cross-appeal&mdash;must comply with Rule 28(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second brief is the &ldquo;appellee's principal and response brief.&rdquo; Because this brief serves as the appellee's principal brief on the merits of the cross-appeal, as well as the appellee's response brief on the merits of the appeal, it must also comply with Rule 28(a), with the limited exceptions noted in the text of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third brief is the &ldquo;appellant's response and reply brief.&rdquo; Like a response brief in a case that does not involve a cross-appeal&mdash;that is, a response brief that does not also serve as a principal brief on the merits of a cross-appeal&mdash;the appellant's response and reply brief must comply with Rule 28(a)(2)&ndash;(9) and (11), with the exceptions noted in the text of the rule. <em>See</em> Rule 28(b). The one difference between the appellant's response and reply brief, on the one hand, and a response brief filed in a case that does not involve a cross-appeal, on the other, is that the latter must include a corporate disclosure statement. <em>See</em> Rule 28(a)(1) and (b). An appellant filing a response and reply brief in a case involving a cross-appeal has already filed a corporate disclosure statement with its principal brief on the merits of the appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fourth brief is the &ldquo;appellee's reply brief.&rdquo; Like a reply brief in a case that does not involve a cross-appeal, it must comply with Rule 28(c), which essentially restates the requirements of Rule 28(a)(2)&ndash;(3) and (11). (Rather than restating the requirements of Rule 28(a)(2)&ndash;(3) and (11), as Rule 28(c) does, Rule 28.1(c)(4) includes a direct cross-reference.) The appellee's reply brief must also be limited to the issues presented by the cross-appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d).</em> Subdivision (d) specifies the colors of the covers on briefs filed in a case involving a cross-appeal. It is patterned after Rule 32(a)(2), which does not specifically refer to cross-appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e).</em> Subdivision (e) sets forth limits on the length of the briefs filed in a case involving a cross-appeal. It is patterned after Rule 32(a)(7), which does not specifically refer to cross-appeals. Subdivision (e) permits the appellee's principal and response brief to be longer than a typical principal brief on the merits because this brief serves not only as the principal brief on the merits of the cross-appeal, but also as the response brief on the merits of the appeal. Likewise, subdivision (e) permits the appellant's response and reply brief to be longer than a typical reply brief because this brief serves not only as the reply brief in the appeal, but also as the response brief in the cross-appeal. For purposes of determining the maximum length of an amicus curiae's brief filed in a case involving a cross-appeal, Rule 29(d)'s reference to &ldquo;the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief&rdquo; should be understood to refer to subdivision (e)'s limitations on the length of an appellant's principal brief.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f).</em> Subdivision (f) provides deadlines for serving and filing briefs in a cross-appeal. It is patterned after Rule 31(a)(1), which does not specifically refer to cross-appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> The Committee adopted the recommendation of the Style Subcommittee that the text of Rule 28.1 be changed in a few minor respects to improve clarity. (That recommendation is described below.) The Committee also adopted three suggestions made by the Department of Justice: (1) A sentence was added to the Committee Note to Rule 28.1(b) to clarify that the term &ldquo;appellant&rdquo; (and &ldquo;appellee&rdquo;) as used by rules other than Rules 28.1, 30, and 34, refers to both the appellant in an appeal and the cross-appellant in a cross-appeal (and to both the appellee in an appeal and the cross-appellee in a cross-appeal). (2) Rule 28.1(d) was amended to prescribe cover colors for supplemental briefs and briefs filed by an intervenor or amicus curiae. (3) A few words were added to the Committee Note to Rule 28.1(e) to clarify the length of an amicus curiae's brief.</p>
