<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) How Obtained; Time for Filing Notice of Appeal.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Review of a decision of the United States Tax Court is commenced by filing a notice of appeal with the Tax Court clerk within 90 days after the entry of the Tax Court's decision. At the time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with Rule 3(d). If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 120 days after the Tax Court's decision is entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If, under Tax Court rules, a party makes a timely motion to vacate or revise the Tax Court's decision, the time to file a notice of appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion or from the entry of a new decision, whichever is later.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Notice of Appeal; How Filed.</strong> The notice of appeal may be filed either at the Tax Court clerk's office in the District of Columbia or by mail addressed to the clerk. If sent by mail the notice is considered filed on the postmark date, subject to &sect;7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Contents of the Notice of Appeal; Service; Effect of Filing and Service.</strong> Rule 3 prescribes the contents of a notice of appeal, the manner of service, and the effect of its filing and service. Form 2 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) The Record on Appeal; Forwarding; Filing.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An appeal from the Tax Court is governed by the parts of Rules 10, 11, and 12 regarding the record on appeal from a district court, the time and manner of forwarding and filing, and the docketing in the court of appeals. References in those rules and in Rule 3 to the district court and district clerk are to be read as referring to the Tax Court and its clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If an appeal from a Tax Court decision is taken to more than one court of appeals, the original record must be sent to the court named in the first notice of appeal filed. In an appeal to any other court of appeals, the appellant must apply to that other court to make provision for the record.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision effects two changes in practice respecting review of Tax Court decisions: (1) Section 7483 of the Internal Revenue Code, 68A Stat. 891, 26 U.S.C. &sect;7483, provides that review of a Tax Court decision may be obtained by filing a petition for review. The subdivision provides for review by the filing of the simple and familiar notice of appeal used to obtain review of district court judgments; (2) Section 7483, <em>supra</em>, requires that a petition for review be filed within 3 months after a decision is rendered, and provides that if a petition is so filed by one party, any other party may file a petition for review within 4 months after the decision is rendered. In the interest of fixing the time for review with precision, the proposed rule substitutes &ldquo;90 days&rdquo; and &ldquo;120 days&rdquo; for the statutory &ldquo;3 months&rdquo; and &ldquo;4 months&rdquo;, respectively. The power of the Court to regulate these details of practice is clear. Title 28 U.S.C. &sect;2072, as amended by the Act of November 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 1323 (1 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 1546 (1966)), authorizes the Court to regulate &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. practice and procedure in proceedings for the review by the courts of appeals of decisions of the Tax Court of the United States.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph states the settled teaching of the case law. See <em>Robert Louis Stevenson Apartments, Inc. v. C.I.R</em>., 337 F.2d 681, 10 A.L.R.3d 112 (8th Cir., 1964); <em>Denholm & McKay Co. v. C.I.R</em>., 132 F.2d 243 (1st Cir., 1942); <em>Helvering v. Continental Oil Co</em>., 63 App.D.C. 5, 68 F.2d 750 (1934); <em>Burnet v. Lexington Ice & Coal Co</em>., 62 F.2d 906 (4th Cir., 1933); <em>Griffiths v. C.I.R</em>., 50 F.2d 782 (7th Cir., 1931).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The subdivision incorporates the statutory provision (Title 26, U.S.C. &sect;7502) that timely mailing is to be treated as timely filing. The statute contains special provisions respecting other than ordinary mailing. If the notice of appeal is sent by registered mail, registration is deemed prima facie evidence that the notice was delivered to the clerk of the Tax Court, and the date of registration is deemed the postmark date. If the notice of appeal is sent by certified mail, the effect of certification with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date depends upon regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. The effect of a postmark made other than by the United States Post Office likewise depends upon regulations of the Secretary. Current regulations are found in 26 CFR &sect;301.7502&ndash;1.</p>

<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment reflects the change in the title of the Tax Court to &ldquo;United States Tax Court.&rdquo; See 26 U.S.C. &sect;7441.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:26 --><h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment requires a party filing a notice of appeal to provide the court with sufficient copies of the notice for service on all other parties.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood.
