<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;250(2), 250a, and 262 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;145, 156, 36 Stat. 1136, 1139; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, &sect;304, 42 Stat. 24; Aug. 30, 1935, ch. 831, &sect;13, 49 Stat. 1049; July 13, 1943, ch. 231, 57 Stat. 553).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates limitation provisions of sections 250(2), 250a, and 262 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;a person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;married women first accrued during marriage, of persons under the age of twenty-one years first accrued during minority, and of idiots, lunatics, insane persons, and persons beyond the seas at the time the claim accrued; entitled to the claim,&rdquo;. The revised language will cover all legal disabilities actually barring suit. For example, the particular reference to married women is archaic, and is eliminated by use of the general language substituted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;nor shall any of the said disabilities operate cumulatively&rdquo; were omitted, in view of the elimination of the reference to specific disabilities. Also, persons under legal disability could not sue, and their suits should not be barred until they become able to sue. Similar sections of the U.S. Code do not contain any such provision. (For example, see section 502 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., incorporated in section 544 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The section was extended to include claims referred by the head of an executive department in conformity with section 2510 of this title.</p>
