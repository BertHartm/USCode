<h3 class="section-head">Rule 55. Default</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Entry</cap-smallcap>. When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party's default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Judgment</cap-smallcap>. Judgment by default may be entered as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>By the Clerk</em>. When the plaintiff's claim against a defendant is for a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain, the clerk upon request of the plaintiff and upon affidavit of the amount due shall enter judgment for that amount and costs against the defendant, if the defendant has been defaulted for failure to appear and is not an infant or incompetent person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>By the Court</em>. In all other cases the party entitled to a judgment by default shall apply to the court therefor; but no judgment by default shall be entered against an infant or incompetent person unless represented in the action by a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other such representative who has appeared therein. If the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action, the party (or, if appearing by representative, the party's representative) shall be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior to the hearing on such application. If, in order to enable the court to enter judgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of damages or to establish the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an investigation of any other matter, the court may conduct such hearings or order such references as it deems necessary and proper and shall accord a right of trial by jury to the parties when and as required by any statute of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Setting Aside Default</cap-smallcap>. For good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Plaintiffs, Counterclaimants, Cross-Claimants</cap-smallcap>. The provisions of this rule apply whether the party entitled to the judgment by default is a plaintiff, a third-party plaintiff, or a party who has pleaded a cross-claim or counterclaim. In all cases a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of Rule 54(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Judgment Against the United States</cap-smallcap>. No judgment by default shall be entered against the United States or an officer or agency thereof unless the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This represents the joining of the equity decree <em>pro confesso</em> ([former] Equity Rules 12 (Issue of Subpoena&mdash;Time for Answer), 16 (Defendant to Answer&mdash;Default&mdash;Decree <em>Pro Confesso</em>), 17 (Decree <em>Pro Confesso</em> to be Followed by Final Decree&mdash;Setting Aside Default), 29 (Defenses&mdash;How Presented), 31 (Reply&mdash;When Required&mdash;When Cause at Issue)) and the judgment by default now governed by U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;724 (Conformity act). For dismissal of an action for failure to comply with these rules or any order of the court, see rule 41(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. The provision for the entry of default comes from the Massachusetts practice, 2 Mass.Gen.Laws (Ter.Ed., 1932) ch. 231, &sect;57. For affidavit of default, see 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9256.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. The provision in paragraph (1) for the entry of judgment by the clerk when plaintiff claims a sum certain is found in the N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;485, in Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;585(1), and in Conn.Practice Book (1934) &sect;47. For provisions similar to paragraph (2), compare Calif.Code, <em>supra</em>, &sect;585(2); N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;490; 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9256(3); 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;411(2). U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;785 (Action to recover forfeiture in bond) and similar statutes are preserved by the last clause of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e)</em>. This restates substantially the last clause of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;763 (Action against the United States under the Tucker Act). As this rule governs in all actions against the United States, U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;45 (Practice and procedure in certain cases under the interstate commerce laws) and similar statutes are modified insofar as they contain anything inconsistent therewith.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Supplementary Note</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note</em>. The operation of Rule 55(b) (Judgment) is directly affected by the Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. [App.] &sect;501 <em>et seq</em>.). Section 200 of the Act [50 U.S.C. Appendix, &sect;520] imposes specific requirements which must be fulfilled before a default judgment can be entered (<em>e.g., Ledwith v. Storkan</em> (D.Neb. 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 60b.24, Case 2, 2 F.R.D. 539, and also provides for the vacation of a judgment in certain circumstances. See discussion in Commentary, <em>Effect of Conscription Legislation on the Federal Rules</em> (1940) 3 Fed.Rules Serv. 725; 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) Cum.Supplement &sect;55.02.</p>
