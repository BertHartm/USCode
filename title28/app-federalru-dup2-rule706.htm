<h3 class="section-head">Rule 706. Court Appointed Experts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Appointment.</cap-smallcap> The court may on its own motion or on the motion of any party enter an order to show cause why expert witnesses should not be appointed, and may request the parties to submit nominations. The court may appoint any expert witnesses agreed upon by the parties, and may appoint expert witnesses of its own selection. An expert witness shall not be appointed by the court unless the witness consents to act. A witness so appointed shall be informed of the witness&rsquo; duties by the court in writing, a copy of which shall be filed with the clerk, or at a conference in which the parties shall have opportunity to participate. A witness so appointed shall advise the parties of the witness&rsquo; findings, if any; the witness&rsquo; deposition may be taken by any party; and the witness may be called to testify by the court or any party. The witness shall be subject to cross-examination by each party, including a party calling the witness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Compensation.</cap-smallcap> Expert witnesses so appointed are entitled to reasonable compensation in whatever sum the court may allow. The compensation thus fixed is payable from funds which may be provided by law in criminal cases and civil actions and proceedings involving just compensation under the fifth amendment. In other civil actions and proceedings the compensation shall be paid by the parties in such proportion and at such time as the court directs, and thereafter charged in like manner as other costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Appointment.</cap-smallcap> In the exercise of its discretion, the court may authorize disclosure to the jury of the fact that the court appointed the expert witness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Parties&rsquo; Experts of Own Selection.</cap-smallcap> Nothing in this rule limits the parties in calling expert witnesses of their own selection.</p>

<p class="note-body">The practice of shopping for experts, the venality of some experts, and the reluctance of many reputable experts to involve themselves in litigation, have been matters of deep concern. Though the contention is made that court appointed experts acquire an aura of infallibility to which they are not entitled. Levy, Impartial Medical Testimony&mdash;Revisited, 34 Temple L.Q. 416 (1961), the trend is increasingly to provide for their use. While experience indicates that actual appointment is a relatively infrequent occurrence, the assumption may be made that the availability of the procedure in itself decreases the need for resorting to it. The ever-present possibility that the judge may appoint an expert in a given case must inevitably exert a sobering effect on the expert witness of a party and upon the person utilizing his services.</p>
<p class="note-body">The inherent power of a trial judge to appoint an expert of his own choosing is virtually unquestioned. <em>Scott v. Spanjer Bros., Inc</em>., 298 F.2d 928 (2d Cir. 1962); <em>Danville Tobacco Assn. v. Bryant-Buckner Associates, Inc</em>., 333 F.2d 202 (4th Cir. 1964); Sink, The Unused Power of a Federal Judge to Call His Own Expert Witnesses, 29 S.Cal.L.Rev. 195 (1956); 2 Wigmore &sect;563, 9 <em>Id</em>. &sect;2484; Annot., 95 A.L.R.2d 383. Hence the problem becomes largely one of detail.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:392 --><p class="note-body">The New York plan is well known and is described in Report by Special Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York: Impartial Medical Testimony (1956). On recommendation of the Section of Judicial Administration, local adoption of an impartial medical plan was endorsed by the American Bar Association. 82 A.B.A.Rep. 184&ndash;185 (1957). Descriptions and analyses of plans in effect in various parts of the country are found in Van Dusen, A United States District Judge's View of the Impartial Medical Expert System, 322 F.R.D. 498 (1963); Wick and Kightlinger, Impartial Medical Testimony Under the Federal Civil Rules: A Tale of Three Doctors, 34 Ins. Counsel J. 115 (1967); and numerous articles collected in Klein, Judicial Administration and the Legal Profession 393 (1963). Statutes and rules include California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;730&ndash;733; Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215(d), Ill.Rev.Stat.1969, c. 110A, &sect;215(d); Burns Indiana Stats. 1956, &sect;9&ndash;1702; Wisconsin Stats.Annot.1958, &sect;957.27.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the federal practice, a comprehensive scheme for court appointed experts was initiated with the adoption of Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in 1946. The Judicial Conference of the United States in 1953 considered court appointed experts in civil cases, but only with respect to whether they should be compensated from public funds, a proposal which was rejected. Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States 23 (1953). The present rule expands the practice to include civil cases.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is based on Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, with a few changes, mainly in the interest of clarity. Language has been added to provide specifically for the appointment either on motion of a party or on the judge's own motion. A provision subjecting the court appointed expert to deposition procedures has been incorporated. The rule has been revised to make definite the right of any party, including the party calling him, to cross-examine.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> combines the present provision for compensation in criminal cases with what seems to be a fair and feasible handling of civil cases, originally found in the Model Act and carried from there into Uniform Rule 60. See also California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;730&ndash;731. The special provision for Fifth Amendment compensation cases is designed to guard against reducing constitutionally guaranteed just compensation by requiring the recipient to pay costs. See Rule 71A(<em>l</em>) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> seems to be essential if the use of court appointed experts is to be fully effective. Uniform Rule 61 so provides.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is in essence the last sentence of Rule 28(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
