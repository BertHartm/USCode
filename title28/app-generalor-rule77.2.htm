<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Clerk Authorization.</strong> Any motion for enlargement of time to answer or respond to the complaint or, for substitution of counsel, may be acted upon by the clerk of the court if (1) the motion states that opposing counsel has no objection, (2) no opposition to the motion has been timely filed, or (3) opposing counsel files a consent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In acting on motions for enlargement of time under this subdivision of the rule, the total enlargement of time allowed by the clerk with respect to any matter shall not exceed 60 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Signing of Orders for Absent Judges.</strong> If the judge to whom the action is assigned is not available and there is an emergency necessitating an order, the matter shall be presented to the chief judge, or to another judge designated by the assigned judge.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule has no FRCP counterpart. The rule was changed in several respects. First, former subdivisions (a) and (b) were combined into a new subdivision (a). Second, language in former subdivision (a) relating to the &ldquo;permanent withdrawal of papers&rdquo; was deleted to reflect corresponding changes in RCFC 77.3 that abolish the practice of permitting the withdrawal of papers from the clerk's office. Third, former subdivisions (c) and (d) were deleted as unnecessary. Finally, new subdivision (b) reflects text transferred from former subdivision (g) of RCFC 77.</p>
