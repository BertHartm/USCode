<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Real Party in Interest.</strong> Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, or a party authorized by statute may sue in that person's own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not pros<!-- PDFPage:404 -->ecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Capacity to Sue or be Sued.</strong> The capacity of an individual, other than one acting in a representative capacity, to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the individual's domicile. The capacity of a corporation to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law under which it was organized. In all other cases capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the applicable state, except (1) that a partnership or other unincorporated association which has no capacity by the law of its state may sue or be sued in its common name for the purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and (2) that the capacity of a receiver appointed by a court of the United States to sue or be sued in a court of the United States is governed by Title 28, U.S.C., Sections 754 and 959(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Infants or Incompetent Persons.</strong> Whenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on behalf of the infant or incompetent person. An infant or incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 17 was modified in minor respects in order to achieve closer conformity with FRCP 17. A difference between the court's rule and the corresponding federal rule occurs in subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) of the federal rule, subtitled &ldquo;Capacity to Sue or be Sued,&rdquo; provides generally that, in those cases for which no rule of decision is provided, &ldquo;capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the state in which the district court is held.&rdquo; In recognition of this court's nationwide jurisdiction, the quoted language was rewritten by substituting &ldquo;by the law of the applicable state&rdquo; for &ldquo;by the law of the state in which the district court is held.&rdquo;</p>

A third party may join, to the extent permitted by law, as many claims as the party has against the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Joinder of Remedies.</strong> Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 19. Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Persons to be Joined if Feasible.</strong> A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made an involuntary plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder not Feasible.</strong> If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder.</strong> A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall state the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as prescribed in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Exception of Class Actions.</strong> This rule is subject to provisions of RCFC 23.</p>

A plaintiff need not be interested in obtaining all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials.</strong> The court may make such orders as will prevent a party from being embarrassed, delayed, or put to expense by the inclusion of a party against whom the party asserts no claim and who asserts no claim against the party, and may order separate trials or make other orders to prevent delay or prejudice.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 23. Class Actions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action.</strong> One or more members of a class may sue as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Class Actions Maintainable.</strong> An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> the United States has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. Matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by members of the class; and (C) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Determination by Order Whether Class Action to be Maintained; Notice; Judgment; Actions Conducted Partially as Class Actions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained. An order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> In any class action maintained, the court shall direct to the potential members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including notice to all individuals who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice shall advise that (A) the court will include the individual in the class action if the individual so requests by a specified date; and (B) the judgment(s), whether favorable or not, will bind the member(s) of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under subdivisions (b)(1) or (b)(2), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and specify or describe those to whom the notice provided in subdivision (c)(2) was directed, and who have requested inclusion, and whom the court finds to be members of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> When appropriate, (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Orders in Conduct of Actions.</strong> In the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders: (1) determining the course of proceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument; (2) requiring, for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct to some or all of the members of any step in the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come into the action; (3) imposing conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors; (4) requiring that the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent persons, and that the action proceed accordingly; (5) dealing with similar procedural matters. The orders may be combined with an order under RCFC 16, and may be altered or amended as may be desirable from time to time.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:406 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Dismissal or Compromise.</strong> A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Appeals.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 23 was completely rewritten. Although the court's rule is modeled largely on the comparable federal rule, there are significant differences between the two rules. In the main, the court's rule adopts the criteria for certifying and maintaining a class action as set forth in <em>Quinault Allottee Ass'n v. United States</em>, 197 Ct. Cl. 134, 453 F.2d 1272 (1972).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the relief available in this court is generally confined to individual money claims against the United States, the situations justifying the use of a class action are correspondingly narrower than those addressed in FRCP 23. Thus, the court's rule does not accommodate, <em>inter alia</em>, the factual situations redressable through declaratory and injunctive relief contemplated under FRCP (b)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Additionally, unlike the federal rule, the court's rule contemplates only opt-in class certifications, not opt-out classes. The latter were viewed as inappropriate here because of the need for specificity in money judgments against the United States, and the fact that the court's injunctive powers&mdash;the typical focus of an opt-out class&mdash;are more limited than those of a district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the court's rule does not contain a provision comparable to FRCP 23(f). That subdivision, which provides that a &ldquo;court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. granting or denying class certification&rdquo; has its origin in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(e), which authorizes the Supreme Court to promulgate rules that provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision other than those set out in Section 1292. Because no comparable statutory authority exists for this court's promulgation of a similar rule, subdivision (f) was omitted. It should be noted, however, that the Court of Federal Claims may certify questions to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1292(b) and 1295.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In a derivative action brought by one or more shareholders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association, the corporation or association having failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it, the complaint shall be verified and shall allege (1) that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains or that the plaintiff's share or membership thereafter devolved on the plaintiff by operation of law, and (2) that the action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on this court which it would not otherwise have. The complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for the plaintiff's failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association. The action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to shareholders or members in such manner as the court directs.</p>
