<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;41(1) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;24, par. 1, 36 Stat. 1091; May 14, 1934, ch. 283, &sect;1, 48 Stat. 775; Aug. 21, 1937, ch. 726, &sect;1, 50 Stat. 738; Apr. 20, 1940, ch. 117, 54 Stat. 143).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1331, 1341, 1342, 1345, 1354, and 1359 of this title. (See reviser's notes under said sections.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Jurisdiction conferred by other sections of this chapter, except section 1335, is not dependent upon diversity of citizenship. (See annotations under former section 41 of title 28, U.S.C.A., and 35 C.J.S., p. 833 et seq. &sect;&sect;30&ndash;43. See, also, reviser's note under section 1331 of this title.) As to citizenship of bank where jurisdiction depends upon diversity of citizenship, see section 1348 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;all civil actions&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity&rdquo; in order to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or citizens of the District of Columbia, Territory of Hawaii, or Alaska, and any State or Territory&rdquo; which were inserted by the amendatory act April 20, 1940, are omitted. The word &ldquo;States&rdquo; is defined in this section and enumeration of the references is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section conforms with the views of Philip F. Herrick, United States Attorney, Puerto Rico, who observed that the act of April 20, 1940, permitted action between a citizen of Hawaii and of Puerto Rico, but not between a citizen of New York and Puerto Rico, in the district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">This changes the law to insure uniformity. The 1940 amendment applied only to the provision as to controversies between &ldquo;citizens of different States.&rdquo; The new definition in subsection (b) extends the 1940 amendment to apply to controversies between citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">The diversity of citizenship language of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as amended in 1940, was described as ambiguous in <em>McGarry v. City of Bethlehem</em>, 45 F.Supp. 385, 386. In that case the 1940 amendment was held unconstitutional insofar as it affected the District of Columbia. However, two other district courts upheld the amendment. <em>Winkler v. Daniels</em>, D.C.Va. 1942, 43 F.Supp. 265; <em>Glaeser v. Acacia Mutual Life Ass'n</em>., D.C.Cal. 1944, 55 F.Supp. 925.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section is intended to cover all diversity of citizenship instances in civil actions in accordance with the judicial construction of the language in the original section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Therefore, the revised language covers civil actions between&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State, and citizens of other States and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a Territory or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of different States;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of different Territories;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State, and citizens of Territories;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State or Territory, and citizens of the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section removes an uncertainty referred to in the McGarry case, supra, as to whether Congress intended to permit citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia to sue a State or Territory itself rather than the citizens thereof. The court observed that &ldquo;Congress could hardly have had such intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The sentence &ldquo;The foregoing provisions as to the sum or value of the matter in controversy shall not be construed to apply to any of the cases mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs of this section&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary. Those paragraphs are (2)&ndash;(28) of said section 41 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which are revised and incorporated in this chapter and, except for those relating to actions against the United States and interpleader, contains no provision as to a sum or value necessary to confer jurisdiction. Consequently the omitted sentence is covered by excluding such requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as originally enacted, purported to include all jurisdictional provisions relating to the district courts. Subsequently, <!-- PDFPage:311 -->many special jurisdictional provisions were enacted and incorporated in other titles of the U.S.C., 1940 ed., as follows:</p>
