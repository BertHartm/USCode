<p class="note-body">This carries forward the substance of Admiralty Rule 19.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 19 provided the remedy of arrest in controversies involving title and possession in general. See <em>The Tilton</em>, 23 Fed. Cas. 1277 (No. 14, 054) (C.C.D. Mass. 1830). <!-- PDFPage:337 -->In addition it provided that remedy in controversies between co-owners respecting the employment of a vessel. It did not deal comprehensively with controversies between co-owners, omitting the remedy of partition. Presumably the omission is traceable to the fact that, when the rules were originally promulgated, concepts of substantive law (sometimes stated as concepts of jurisdiction) denied the remedy of partition except where the parties in disagreement were the owners of equal shares. See The Steamboat Orleans, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 175 (1837). The Supreme Court has now removed any doubt as to the jurisdiction of the district courts to partition a vessel, and has held in addition that no fixed principle of federal admiralty law limits the remedy to the case of equal shares. <em>Madruga v. Superior Court</em>, 346 U.S. 556 (1954). It is therefore appropriate to include a reference to partition in the rule.</p>
