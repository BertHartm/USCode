<p class="note-body">The consolidation of sections 661&ndash;667 and 671 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., permitted omission of obsolete, un<!-- PDFPage:410 -->necessary and repetitive provisions in such sections. For example, the provision in section 665 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the court to require production of documents on a plea of non est factum, was omitted. Such plea is obsolete in Federal practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Numerous provisions with respect to authentication were omitted as covered by Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Likewise the provision that official seals shall be judicially noticed was omitted as unnecessary. Seals of Federal agencies are judicially noticed by States and Federal courts without statutory mandate. <em>Gardner v.

<!-- PDFPage:413 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) there is a large and growing number of cases annually involving disputes between persons claiming rights of custody and visitation of children under the laws, and in the courts, of different States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the laws and practices by which the courts of those jurisdictions determine their jurisdiction to decide such disputes, and the effect to be given the decisions of such disputes by the courts of other jurisdictions, are often inconsistent and conflicting;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) those characteristics of the law and practice in such cases, along with the limits imposed by a Federal system on the authority of each such jurisdiction to conduct investigations and take other actions outside its own boundaries, contribute to a tendency of parties involved in such disputes to frequently resort to the seizure, restraint, concealment, and interstate transportation of children, the disregard of court orders, excessive relitigation of cases, obtaining of conflicting orders by the courts of various jurisdictions, and interstate travel and communication that is so expensive and time consuming as to disrupt their occupations and commercial activities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) among the results of those conditions and activities are the failure of the courts of such jurisdictions to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the other jurisdictions, the deprivation of rights of liberty and property without due process of law, burdens on commerce among such jurisdictions and with foreign nations, and harm to the welfare of children and their parents and other custodians.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) For those reasons it is necessary to establish a national system for locating parents and children who travel from one such jurisdiction to another and are concealed in connection with such disputes, and to establish national standards under which the courts of such jurisdictions will determine their jurisdiction to decide such disputes and the effect to be given by each such jurisdiction to such decisions by the courts of other such jurisdictions.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) promote and expand the exchange of information and other forms of mutual assistance between States which are concerned with the same child;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) facilitate the enforcement of custody and visitation decrees of sister States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) discourage continuing interstate controversies over child custody in the interest of greater stability of home environment and of secure family relationships for the child;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict between State courts in matters of child custody and visitation which have in the past resulted in the shifting of children from State to State with harmful effects on their well-being; and</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) there is a large and growing number of child support cases annually involving disputes between parents who reside in different States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the laws by which the courts of different jurisdictions determine their authority to establish child support orders are not uniform;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) those laws, along with the limits imposed by the Federal system on the authority of each State to take certain actions outside its own boundaries&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) encourage noncustodial parents to relocate outside the States where their children and the custodial parents reside to avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of such States, resulting in an increase in the amount of interstate travel and communication required to establish and collect on child support orders and a burden on custodial parents that is expensive, time consuming, and disruptive of occupations and commercial activity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) contribute to the pressing problem of relatively low levels of child support payments in interstate cases and to inequities in child support payments levels that are based solely on the noncustodial parent's choice of residence;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) encourage a disregard of court orders resulting in massive arrearages nationwide;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) allow noncustodial parents to avoid the payment of regularly scheduled child support payments for extensive periods of time, resulting in substantial hardship for the children for whom support is due and for their custodians; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) lead to the excessive relitigation of cases and to the establishment of conflicting orders by the courts of various jurisdictions, resulting in confusion, waste of judicial resources, disrespect for the courts, and a diminution of public confidence in the rule of law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) among the results of the conditions described in this subsection are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the failure of the courts of the States to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the other States;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the deprivation of rights of liberty and property without due process of law;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) burdens on commerce among the States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) harm to the welfare of children and their parents and other custodians.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In view of the findings made in subsection (a), it is necessary to establish national standards under which the courts of the various States shall determine their jurisdiction to issue a child support order and the effect to be given by each State to child support orders issued by the courts of other States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [enacting this section and provisions set out as a note under section 1 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to facilitate the enforcement of child support orders among the States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to discourage continuing interstate controversies over child support in the interest of greater financial stability and secure family relationships for the child; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict among State courts in the establishment of child support orders.&rdquo;</p>
