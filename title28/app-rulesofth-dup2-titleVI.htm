<h3 class="section-head">Rule 38. Jury Trial of Right</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Right Preserved. The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Demand. Any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by (1) serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to the issue, and (2) filing the demand as required by Rule 5(d). Such demand may be indorsed upon a pleading of the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Demand; Specification of Issues. In the demand a party may specify the issues which the party wishes so tried; otherwise the party shall be deemed to have demanded trial by jury for all the issues so triable. If the party has demanded trial by jury for only some of the issues, any other party within 10 days after service of the demand or such lesser time as the court may order, may serve a demand for trial by jury of any other or all of the issues of fact in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Waiver. The failure of a party to serve a demand as required by this rule and to file it as required by this rule constitutes a waiver by the party of trial by jury. A demand for trial by jury made as herein provided may not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 39. Trial by Jury or by the Court</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) By Jury. When trial by jury has been demanded as prescribed by Rule 38, the action shall be so designated. The trial of all issues so demanded shall be by jury, unless (1) the parties or their attorneys of record, by written stipulation filed with the court or by an oral stipulation made in open court and entered in the record, consent to trial by the court sitting without a jury, or (2) the court upon motion or on its own initiative finds that a right of trial by jury of some or all of those issues does not exist under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) By the Court. Issues not demanded for trial by jury as prescribed by Rule 38 shall be tried by the court; but, notwithstanding the failure of a party to demand a jury in an action in which such a demand might have been made of right, the court in its discretion upon motion may order a trial by a jury of any or all issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Advisory Jury and Trial by Consent. In all actions not triable of right by a jury the court upon motion or on its own initiative may try any issue with an advisory jury or, except in actions against the United States when a statute of the United States provides for trial without a jury, the court, with the consent of the parties, may order a trial with a jury whose verdict has the same effect as if trial by jury had been a matter of right.</p>

The request shall be served and filed at least 30 days prior to the requested date of trial, or upon a showing of good cause, at a reasonable time prior to the requested date of trial. A party who opposes the request shall serve and file its opposition within 10 days after service of the request, unless a shorter period is directed by the court. In all instances where a trial is requested to be held at a location other than or in addition to the courthouse at One Federal Plaza, New York, New York, all other parties shall serve and file a response within 10 days after the service of the request, unless a shorter period is directed by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Designation. The court shall designate the date and place for trial, as prescribed in Rule 77(c)(1) or (2), and shall give reasonable notice thereof to the parties.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:540 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) Premarking Exhibits. All exhibits and documents which are intended to be introduced in evidence are to be marked for identification and exhibited to opposing counsel prior to trial or court proceeding.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 41. Dismissal of Actions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Voluntary Dismissal; Effect Thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) By Plaintiff&mdash;By Stipulation. Subject to the provisions of Rule 23(e), of Rule 56.2, of Rule 66, and of any statute of the United States, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (A) by filing a notice of dismissal which shall be substantially in the form set forth in Form 7 of the Appendix of Forms at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or motion for summary judgment, whichever occurs first, or (B) by filing a stipulation of dismissal, which shall be substantially in the form set forth in Form 8 of the Appendix of Forms, signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States or of any state an action based on or including the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) By Order of Court. Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision (a), an action shall not be dismissed by the plaintiff unless upon order of the court, and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon the defendant of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Involuntary Dismissal; Effect Thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Actions on the Reserve Calendar or the Suspension Disposition Calendar are subject to dismissal for lack of prosecution at the expiration of the applicable period of time as prescribed by Rules 83 and 85.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Actions commenced pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c) by the filing of a summons only are subject to dismissal for failure to file a complaint at the expiration of the applicable period of time prescribed by 19 U.S.C. &sect;1516a.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever it appears that there is a failure of the plaintiff to prosecute, the court may upon its own initiative after notice, or upon motion of a defendant, order the action or any claim dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For failure of the plaintiff to comply with these rules or with any order of the court, a defendant may move that the action or any claim against the defendant be dismissed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, operates as an adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Dismissal of Counterclaim, Cross-Claim, or Third-Party Claim. The provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim. A voluntary dismissal by the claimant alone pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of this rule shall be made before a responsive pleading is served or, if there is none, before the introduction of evidence at the trial or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Costs of Previously Dismissed Action. If a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action in any court commences an action based upon or including the same claim against the same defendant, the court may make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it may deem proper and may stay the proceedings in the action until the plaintiff has complied with the order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Consolidation. When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated under a consolidated complaint; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Separate Trials. The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate the right of trial by jury as declared by the <!-- PDFPage:541 -->Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Form. In every trial, the testimony of witnesses shall be taken in open court, unless a federal law, these rules, the Federal Rules of Evidence, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court provide otherwise. The court may, for good cause shown in compelling circumstances and upon appropriate safeguards, permit presentation of testimony in open court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Affirmation in Lieu of Oath. Whenever under these rules an oath is required to be taken, a solemn affirmation may be accepted in lieu thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Evidence on Motions. When a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Interpreters. The court may appoint an interpreter of its own selection and may fix the interpreter's reasonable compensation. The compensation shall be paid out of funds provided by law or by one or more of the parties as the court may direct, and may be taxed ultimately as costs, in the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Documents Specially Admissible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Reports&mdash;Depositions&mdash;Affidavits. In addition to other admissible evidence, when the value of merchandise or any of its components is in issue, reports or depositions of consuls, customs officers, and other officers of the United States and depositions and affidavits of other persons whose attendance cannot reasonably be had, may be admitted in evidence, as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2639(c), when served upon the opposing party in accordance with this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Service. A copy of any report, deposition or affidavit described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision (e), which is intended to be offered in evidence, shall be served on the opposing party with the request for trial. A party other than the party serving the request for trial shall serve a copy of any report, deposition or affidavit which that party intends to offer in evidence upon the opposing party within 15 days after service of the request for trial. Timely service of copies of such documents may be waived or the time extended upon consent, or by order of the court for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Objections. Objections to the admission of such documents in evidence may be made at the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Pricelists&mdash;Catalogs. When the value of merchandise is in issue, pricelists and catalogs may be admitted into evidence when duly authenticated, relevant, and material.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Authentication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Domestic. An official record kept within the United States, or any state, district, commonwealth, or within a territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or by the officer's deputy, and accompanied by a certificate that such officer has the custody. The certificate may be made by a judge of a court of record of the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the court, or may be made by any public officer having a seal of office and having official duties in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the officer's office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Foreign. A foreign official record, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof; or a copy thereof, attested by a person authorized to make the attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to the genuineness of the signature and official position (i) of the attesting person, or (ii) of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official position relates to the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position relating to the attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of the documents, the court may, for good cause shown, (i) admit an attested copy without final certification or (ii) permit the foreign official record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification. The final certification is unnecessary if the record and the attestation are certified as provided in a treaty or convention to which the United States and the foreign country in which the official record is located are parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Lack of Record. A written statement that after diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records designated by the statement, authenticated as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this rule in the case of a domestic record, or complying with the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) of this rule for <!-- PDFPage:542 -->a summary in the case of a foreign record, is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Other Proof. This rule does not prevent the proof of official records or of entry or lack of entry therein by any other method authorized by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) state the name of the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) state the title of the action, and its civil action number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony or to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, documents or tangible things in the possession, custody or control of that person, or to permit inspection of premises, at a time and place therein specified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) set forth the text of subdivisions (c) and (d) of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">A command to produce evidence or to permit inspection may be joined with a command to appear at trial or hearing or at deposition, or may be issued separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A subpoena commanding attendance at a trial or hearing shall issue from the court. A subpoena for attendance at a deposition shall issue from the court. If separate from a subpoena commanding the attendance of a person, a subpoena for production or inspection shall issue from the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before service. An attorney admitted to practice before the Court of International Trade as an officer of the court may also issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to such person and, if the person's attendance is commanded, by tendering to that person the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be tendered. Prior notice of any commanded production of documents and things or inspection of premises before trial shall be served on each party in the manner prescribed by Rule 5(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A) of this rule, a subpoena may be served at any place within 100 miles of the place of the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection specified in the subpoena. When a statute of the United States provides therefor, or when the interest of justice may require, the court upon proper application and cause shown may authorize the service of a subpoena at any other place. A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country who is a national or resident of the United States shall issue under the circumstances and in the manner and be served as provided in Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;1783.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Proof of service when necessary shall be made by filing with the clerk of the court a statement of the date and manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the person who made the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Protection of Persons Subject to Subpoenas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to that subpoena. The court shall enforce this duty and impose upon the party or attorney in breach of this duty an appropriate sanction, which may include, but is not limited to, lost earnings and a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, documents or tangible things, or inspection of premises need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless commanded to appear for deposition, hearing or trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this rule, a person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying may, within 14 days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than 14 days after service, serve upon the party or attorney designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials or of the premises. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the court. If objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an order to compel the production. Such an order to compel production shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying commanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) On timely motion, the court shall quash or modify the subpoena if it</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) fails to allow reasonable time for compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to travel to a place more than 100 miles from the place where that person resides, is employed or regularly transacts <!-- PDFPage:543 -->business in person, except that, subject to the provisions of clause (c)(3)(B)(iii) of this rule, such a person may in order to attend trial be commanded to travel from any such place, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter and no exception or waiver applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) subjects a person to undue burden.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a subpoena</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) requires disclosure of a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) requires disclosure of an unretained expert's opinion or information not describing specific events or occurrences in dispute and resulting from the expert's study made not at the request of any party, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial, the court may, to protect a person subject to or affected by the subpoena, quash or modify the subpoena or, if the party in whose behalf the subpoena is issued shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship and assures that the person to whom the subpoena is addressed will be reasonably compensated, the court may order appearance or production only upon specified conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Duties in Responding to Subpoena.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with categories in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable the demanding party to contest the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Contempt. Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court. An adequate cause for failure to obey exists when a subpoena purports to require a nonparty to attend or produce at a place not within the limits provided by clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 49. Special Verdicts and Interrogatories</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Special Verdicts. The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact. In that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer or may submit written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate. The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue. If in so doing the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives the right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires the party demands its submission to the jury. As to an issue omitted without such demand the court may make a finding; or if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) General Verdict Accompanied by Answer to Interrogatories. The court may submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a general verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict. The court shall give explanation or instruction as may be necessary to enable the jury both to make answers to the interrogatories and to render a general verdict, and <!-- PDFPage:544 -->the court shall direct the jury both to make written answers and to render a general verdict. When the general verdict and the answers are harmonious, the appropriate judgment upon the verdict and answers shall be entered pursuant to Rule 58. When the answers are consistent with each other but one or more is inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment may be entered pursuant to Rule 58 in accordance with the answers, notwithstanding the general verdict, or the court may return the jury for further consideration of its answers and verdict or may order a new trial. When the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment shall not be entered, but the court shall return the jury for further consideration of its answers and verdict or shall order a new trial.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 50. Judgment as a Matter of Law in Actions Tried by Jury; Alternative Motion for New Trial; Conditional Rulings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Judgment as a Matter of Law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Motions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury. Such a motion shall specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Renewal of Motion for Judgment After Trial; Alternative Motion for New Trial. Whenever a motion for a judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Such a motion may be renewed by service and filing not later than 30 days after the entry of judgment. A motion for a new trial under Rule 59 may be joined with a renewal of the motion for judgment as a matter of law, or a new trial may be requested in the alternative. If a verdict was returned, the court may, in disposing of the renewed motion, allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law. If no verdict was returned, the court may, in disposing of the renewed motion, direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law or may order a new trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Same; Conditional Rulings on Grant of Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, the court shall also rule on the motion for a new trial, if any, by determining whether it should be granted if the judgment is thereafter vacated or reversed, and shall specify the grounds for granting or denying the motion for the new trial. If the motion for a new trial is thus conditionally granted, the order thereon does not affect the finality of the judgment. In case the motion for a new trial has been conditionally granted and the judgment is reversed on appeal, the new trial shall proceed unless the appellate court has otherwise ordered. In case the motion for a new trial has been conditionally denied, the appellee on appeal may assert error in that denial; and if the judgment is reversed on appeal, subsequent proceedings shall be in accordance with the order of the appellate court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The party against whom judgment as a matter of law has been rendered may serve a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 not later than 30 days after the entry of the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Same; Denial of Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law. If the motion for judgment as a matter of law is denied, the party who prevailed on that motion may, as appellee, assert grounds entitling the party to a new trial in the event the appellate court concludes that the trial court erred in denying the motion for judgment. If the appellate court reverses the judgment, nothing in this rule precludes it from determining that the appellee is entitled to a new trial, or from directing the trial court to determine whether a new trial shall be granted.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Practice Comment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 50 has been amended to conform to the new Rule 50 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which went into effect on December 1, 1991. The time for filing a motion for a new trial in the court, 30 days, is governed by 28 U.S.C. &sect;2646. To avoid confusion and inefficiency, Rule 50(b) provides the same 30-day filing period for any motion filed thereunder. In contrast, Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides a 10-day period. However, motions for new trials in courts in which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply are not subject to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2646. The same comment is applicable to Rule 50(c)(2).</p>

No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 52. Findings by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Effect. In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the <!-- PDFPage:545 -->court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to Rule 58; and in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall similarly set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action. Requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of review. Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of this court to judge the credibility of the witnesses. The findings of a master, to the extent that the court adopts them, shall be considered as the findings of the court. It will be sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are stated orally and recorded in open court following the close of the evidence or appear in an opinion or memorandum of decision filed by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Amendment. Upon motion of a party, or upon its own motion, made not later than 30 days after the date of entry of the judgment, the court may amend its findings or make additional findings and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may be made with a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59. When findings of fact are made in actions tried by the court without a jury, the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings may thereafter be raised whether or not the party raising the question has made an objection in this court to such findings or has made a motion to amend them or a motion for judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Judgment on Partial Findings. If during a trial without a jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue, or the court may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. Such a judgment shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>

<!-- field-start:head -->
<h3 class="section-head">Rule 53. Masters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Appointment and Compensation. The court, with the concurrence of a majority of all the judges, may appoint one or more standing masters, and a judge, to whom an action is assigned, may appoint a special master therein. As used in these rules, the word &ldquo;master&rdquo; includes a referee, an auditor, an examiner, a commissioner, and an assessor. The compensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties or paid out of any fund or subject matter of the action which is in the custody and control of the court, as the court may direct. The master shall not retain the master's report as security for the master's compensation, but when the party ordered to pay the compensation allowed by the court does not pay it after notice and within the time prescribed by the court, the master is entitled to a writ of execution against the delinquent party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Reference. A reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule. In actions to be tried by a jury, a reference shall be made only when the issues are complicated; in actions to be tried without a jury, save in matters of account and of difficult computation of damages, a reference shall be made only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Powers. The order of reference to the master may specify or limit the master's powers and may direct the master to report only upon particular issues or to do or perform particular acts or to receive and report evidence only and may fix the time and place for beginning and closing the hearings and for the filing of the master's report. Subject to the specifications and limitations stated in the order, the master has and shall exercise the power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before the master and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the master's duties under the order. The master may require the production before the master of evidence upon all matters embraced in the reference, including the production of all books, papers, vouchers, documents, and writings applicable thereto. The master may rule upon the admissibility of evidence unless otherwise directed by the order of reference and has the authority to put witnesses on oath and may examine them and may call the parties to the action and examine them upon oath. When a party so requests, the master shall make a record of the evidence offered and excluded in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as provided in the Federal Rules of Evidence for a court sitting without a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Meetings. When a reference is made, the clerk shall forthwith furnish the master with a copy of the order of reference. Upon receipt thereof unless the order of reference otherwise provides, the master shall forthwith set a time and place for the first meeting of the parties or their attorneys to be held within 20 days after the date of the order of reference and shall notify the parties or their attorneys. It is the duty of the master to proceed with all reasonable diligence. Either party, on notice to the parties and master, may apply to the court for an order requiring the master to speed the proceedings and to make the report. If a party fails to appear at the time and place appointed, the master may proceed ex parte or, in the master's discretion, adjourn the proceedings to a future day, giving notice to the absent party of the adjournment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Witnesses. The parties may procure the attendance of witnesses before the master by the issuance and service of subpoenas as provided in Rule 45. If without adequate excuse a witness fails to appear or give evidence, the witness may be punished as for a contempt and be subject to the consequences, penalties, and remedies provided in Rules 37 and 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Statement of Accounts. When matters of accounting are in issue before the master, the master may prescribe the form in which the accounts shall be submitted and in any proper case may require or receive in evidence a statement <!-- PDFPage:546 -->by a certified public accountant who is called as a witness. Upon objection of a party to any of the items thus submitted or upon a showing that the form of statement is insufficient, the master may require a different form of statement to be furnished, or the accounts or specific items thereof to be proved by oral examination of the accounting parties or upon written interrogatories or in such other manner as the master directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Contents and Filing. The master shall prepare a report upon the matters submitted to the master by the order of reference and, if required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, the master shall set them forth in the report. The master shall file the report with the clerk of the court and serve on all parties notice of the filing. In an action to be tried without a jury, unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall file with the report a transcript of the proceedings and of the evidence and the original exhibits. Unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall serve a copy of the report on each party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In Non-Jury Actions. In an action to be tried without a jury the court shall accept the master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. Within 10 days after being served with notice of the filing of the report any party may serve written objections thereto upon the other parties. Application to the court for action upon the report and upon objections thereto shall be by motion and upon notice as prescribed in Rule 7. The court after hearing may adopt the report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part or may receive further evidence or may recommit it with instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In Jury Actions. In an action to be tried by a jury the master shall not be directed to report the evidence. The master's findings upon the issues submitted to the master are admissible as evidence of the matters found and may be read to the jury, subject to the ruling of the court upon any objections in point of law which may be made to the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Stipulation as to Findings. The effect of a master's report is the same whether or not the parties have consented to the reference; but, when the parties stipulate that a master's findings of fact shall be final, only questions of law arising upon the report shall thereafter be considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Draft Report. Before filing the master's report, a master may submit a draft thereof to counsel for all parties for the purpose of receiving their suggestions.</p>
