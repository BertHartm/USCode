<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Separate Document.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Every judgment and amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document, but a separate document is not required for an order disposing of a motion:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> to amend or make additional findings of fact under RCFC 52(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> for attorney fees under RCFC 54;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> for new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment, under RCFC 59; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> for relief under RCFC 60.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Subject to RCFC 54(b):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the clerk must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly prepare, sign and enter the judgment when the court awards only costs or a sum certain, or denies all relief;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the court must promptly approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when the court grants relief not described in paragraph (a)(2) of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Time of Entry.</strong> Judgment is entered for purposes of RCFC 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, 60, and 62:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> when it is entered in the civil docket under RCFC 79(a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> if a separate document is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this rule, upon the earlier of these events:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> when it is set forth on a separate document, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Cost or Fee Awards.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Entry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees except as provided in RCFC 58(c)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> When a timely motion for attorney fees is made under RCFC 54(d)(2) the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and has become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure as a timely motion under RCFC 59.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Request for Entry.</strong> A party may request that judgment be set forth on a separate document as required by RCFC 58(a)(1).</p>
