<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When Presented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Unless a different time is prescribed in a statute of the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the United States, or an officer or agency thereof, shall serve an answer to the complaint, or to a cross-claim, or a reply to a counterclaim within 60 days after the service upon the Attorney-in-Charge, International Trade Field Office, Commercial Litigation Branch, Department of Justice, of the pleading in which the claim is asserted; except that,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c), no answer shall be served or filed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(f), involving an order to make confidential information available under section 777(c)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the answer shall be served within 10 days after being served with the summons and complaint. For good cause shown, the court in any action may order a different period of time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any other defendant shall serve an answer within 20 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If service of the summons has been timely waived on request under Rule 4(d), within 60 days after the date when the request for waiver was sent, or within 90 days after that date if the defendant was addressed outside any judicial district of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A party other than the United States or an officer or agency thereof served with a pleading stating a cross-claim against the party shall serve an answer thereto within 20 days after being served. The plaintiff shall serve a reply to a counterclaim in the answer within 20 days after service of the answer, or, if a reply is ordered by the court, within 20 days after service of the order, unless the order otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Unless a different time is fixed by court order, the service of a motion permitted under this rule alters these periods of time as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served within 10 days after notice of the court's action; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading shall be served within 10 days after service of the more definite statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) How Presented. Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) insufficiency of process, (4) insufficiency of service of the summons and complaint, (5) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (6) failure to join a party under Rule 19. A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (5) <!-- PDFPage:520 -->to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside of the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such motion by Rule 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Preliminary Hearings. The defenses specifically enumerated (1)&ndash;(6) in subdivision (b) of this rule, whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment mentioned in subdivision (c) of this rule shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Motion for More Definite Statement. If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after notice of the order or within such time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Motion to Strike. Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Consolidation of Defenses in Motion. A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h)(2) of this rule on any of the grounds there stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, insufficiency of process, or insufficiency of service of the summons and complaint is waived (A) if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision (g) of this rule, or (B) if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a defense of failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 19, and an objection of failure to state a legal defense to a claim may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>
