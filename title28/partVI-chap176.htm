<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) any property that is exempt under Federal law, other than paragraph (1), or State or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the application for a remedy under this chapter at the place in which the debtor's domicile has been located for the 180 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of such application, or for a longer portion of such 180-day period than in any other place; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Property Subject to Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Any property in the possession, custody, or control of the debtor and in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest, except earnings, may be attached pursuant to a writ of attachment in an action or proceeding against a debtor on a claim for a debt and may be held as security to satisfy such judgment, and interest and costs, as the United States may recover on such claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The value of property attached shall not exceed the amount by which the sum of the amount of the debt claimed by the United States and the amount of interest and costs reasonably likely to be assessed against the debtor by the court exceeds the aggregate value of the nonexempt interest of the debtor in any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) property securing the debt; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) property garnished or in receivership, or income sequestered, under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the requirements of section 3101 are satisfied, a court shall issue a writ authorizing the United States to attach property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest, as security for such judgment (and interest and costs) as the United States may recover on a claim for a debt&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in an action on a contract, express or implied, against the debtor for payment of money, only if the United States shows reasonable cause to believe that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contract is not fully secured by real or personal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the original security is substantially diminished, without any act of the United States or the person to whom the security was given, below the amount of the debt;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in an action against the debtor for damages in tort;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the debtor resides outside the jurisdiction of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in an action to recover a fine, penalty, or tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Writ; Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsections (a) and (b), a writ of attachment shall be issued by the court directing the United States marshal of the district where property described in subsection (a) is located to attach the property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The writ of attachment shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date of the issuance of the writ;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Levy of Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The United States marshal receiving the writ shall proceed without delay to levy upon the property specified for attachment if found within the district. The marshal may not sell property unless ordered by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In performing the levy, the United States marshal may enter any property owned, occupied, or controlled by the debtor, except that the marshal may not enter a residence or other building unless the writ expressly authorizes the marshal to do so or upon specific order of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Levy on real property is made by entering the property and posting the writ and notice of levy in a conspicuous place upon the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Levy on personal property is made by taking possession of it. Levy on personal property not easily taken into possession or which cannot be taken into possession without great inconvenience or expense may be made by affixing a copy of the writ and notice of levy on it or in a conspicuous place in the vicinity of it describing in the notice of levy the property by quantity and with sufficient detail to identify the property levied on.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The United States marshal shall file a copy of the notice of levy in the same manner as provided for judgments in section 3201(a)(1). The United States marshal shall serve a copy of the writ and notice of levy on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the debtor against whom the writ is issued; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the person who has possession of the property subject to the writ;</p>

If no property was attached, the return shall so state.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the property levied on is claimed, replevied under subsection (j)(2), or sold under section 3007 after the return, the United States marshal shall immediately make a further return to the clerk of the court showing the disposition of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If personal property is replevied, the United States marshal shall deliver the replevin bond to the clerk of the court to be filed in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Levy of Attachment as Lien on Property; Satisfaction of Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A levy on property under a writ of attachment under this section creates a lien in favor of the United States on the property or, in the case of perishable property sold under section 3007, on the proceeds of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such lien shall be ranked ahead of any other security interests perfected after the later of the time of levy and the time a copy of the notice of levy is filed under subsection (d)(5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such lien shall arise from the time of levy and shall continue until a judgment in the ac<!-- PDFPage:614 -->tion is obtained or denied, or the action is otherwise dismissed. The death of the debtor whose property is attached does not terminate the attachment lien. Upon issuance of a judgment in the action and registration under this chapter, the judgment lien so created relates back to the time of levy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Reduction or Dissolution of Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If an excessive or unreasonable attachment is made, the debtor may submit a motion to the court for a reduction of the amount of the attachment or its dissolution.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall order a part of the property to be released, if after a hearing the court finds that the amount of the attachment is excessive or unreasonable or if the attachment is for an amount larger than the sum of the liquidated or ascertainable amount of the debt and the amount of interest and costs likely to be taxed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The court shall dissolve the attachment if the amount of the debt is unliquidated and unascertainable by calculation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any property claimed to be exempt is levied on, the debtor may, at any time after such levy, request that the court vacate such levy. If it appears to the court that the property so levied upon is exempt, the court shall order the levy vacated and the property returned to the debtor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Replevin of Attached Property by Debtor; Bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If attached property is not sold before judgment, the debtor may replevy such property or any part thereof by giving a bond approved by counsel for the United States or the court and payable to the United States in double the reasonable value of the property to be replevied or double the value of the claim, whichever is less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of Personal Property Under Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If personal property in custody of the United States marshal under a writ of attachment is not replevied, claimed, or sold, the court may make such order for its preservation or use as appears to be in the interest of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Judgment and Disposition of Attached Property.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Judgment for the united states</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On entry of judgment for the United States, the court shall order the proceeds of personal property sold pursuant to section 3007 to be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment, and shall order the sale of any remaining personal property and any real property levied on to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Judgment for the united states when personal property replevied</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With respect to personal property under attachment that is replevied, the judgment which may be entered shall be against the debtor against whom the writ of attachment is issued and also against the sureties on the debtor's replevin bond for the value of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Restoration of property and exoneration of replevin bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the attachment is vacated or if the judgment on the claim for the debt is for the person against whom the writ attachment is issued, the court shall order the property, or proceeds of perishable property sold under section 3007, restored to the debtor and shall exonerate any replevin bond.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A court may issue a writ of garnishment against property (including non<!-- PDFPage:621 -->exempt disposable earnings) in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest and which is in the possession, custody, or control of a person other than the debtor, in order to satisfy the judgment against the debtor. Co-owned property shall be subject to garnishment to the same extent as co-owned property is subject to garnishment under the law of the State in which such property is located. A court may issue simultaneous separate writs of garnishment to several garnishees. A writ of garnishment issued under this subsection shall be continuing and shall terminate only as provided in subsection (c)(10).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Writ.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States shall include in its application for a writ of garnishment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the judgment debtor's name, social security number (if known), and last known address;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Proper garnishee for particular property.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If the property consists of a right to or share in the stock of an association or corporation, or interests or profits therein, for which a certificate of stock or other negotiable instrument is not outstanding, the corporation, or the president or treasurer of the association shall be the garnishee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the property consists of an interest in a partnership interest, any partner other than the debtor shall be the garnishee on behalf of the partnership.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the property or a debt is evidenced by a negotiable instrument for the payment of money, a negotiable document of title or a certificate of stock of an association or corporation, the instrument, document, or certificate shall be treated as property capable of delivery and the person holding it shall be the garnishee, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subject to clause (ii), in the case of a security which is transferable in the manner set forth in State law, the entity that carries on its books an account in the name of the debtor in which is reflected such security shall be the garnishee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notwithstanding clause (i), the pledgee shall be the garnishee if such security is pledged.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures Applicable to Writ.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Court determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court determines that the requirements of this section are satisfied, the court shall issue an appropriate writ of garnishment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Form of writ</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The writ shall state&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The nature and amount of the debt, and any cost and interest owed with respect to the debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The name and address of the garnishee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The name and address of counsel for the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The last known address of the judgment debtor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) That the garnishee shall answer the writ within 10 days of service of the writ.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) That the garnishee shall withhold and retain any property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest and for which the garnishee is or may become indebted to the judgment debtor pending further order of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Service of writ</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States shall serve the garnishee and the judgment debtor with a copy of the writ of garnishment and shall certify to the court that this service was made. The writ shall be accompanied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an instruction explaining the requirement that the garnishee submit a written answer to the writ; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) instructions to the judgment debtor for objecting to the answer of the garnishee and for obtaining a hearing on the objections.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Answer of the garnishee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In its written answer to the writ of garnishment, the garnishee shall state under oath&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the garnishee has custody, control or possession of such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a description of such property and the value of such interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a description of any previous garnishments to which such property is subject and the extent to which any remaining property is not exempt; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the amount of the debt the garnishee anticipates owing to the judgment debtor in the future and whether the period for payment will be weekly or another specified period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The garnishee shall file the original answer with the court issuing the writ and serve a copy on the debtor and counsel for the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Objections to answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 20 days after receipt of the answer, the judgment debtor or the United States may file a written objection to the answer and request a hearing. The party objecting shall state the grounds for the objection and bear the burden of proving such grounds. A copy of the objection and request for a hearing shall be served on the garnishee and all other parties. The court shall hold a hearing within 10 days after the date the request is received by the court, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, and give notice of the hearing date to all the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Garnishee's failure to answer or pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a garnishee fails to answer the writ of garnishment or to withhold property in accordance with the writ, the United States may petition the court for an order requiring the garnishee to appear before the court to answer the writ and to so withhold property before the appearance date. If the garnishee fails to appear, or appears and fails to show good cause why the garnishee failed to comply with the writ, the court shall enter judgment against the garnishee for the value of the judgment debtor's nonexempt interest in such property (including nonexempt disposable <!-- PDFPage:622 -->earnings). The court may award a reasonable attorney's fee to the United States and against the garnishee if the writ is not answered within the time specified therein and a petition requiring the garnishee to appear is filed as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Disposition order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After the garnishee files an answer and if no hearing is requested within the required time period, the court shall promptly enter an order directing the garnishee as to the disposition of the judgment debtor's nonexempt interest in such property. If a hearing is timely requested, the order shall be entered within 5 days after the hearing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Priorities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Judicial orders and garnishments for the support of a person shall have priority over a writ of garnishment issued under this section. As to any other writ of garnishment or levy, a garnishment issued under this section shall have priority over writs which are issued later in time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Accounting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) While a writ of garnishment is in effect under this section, the United States shall give an annual accounting on the garnishment to the judgment debtor and the garnishee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Within 10 days after the garnishment terminates, the United States shall give a cumulative written accounting to the judgment debtor and garnishee of all property it receives under a writ of garnishment. Within 10 days after such accounting is received, the judgment debtor or garnishee may file a written objection to the accounting and a request for hearing. The party objecting shall state grounds for the objection. The court shall hold a hearing on the objection within 10 days after the court receives the request for a hearing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) <cap-smallcap>Termination of garnishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A garnishment under this chapter is terminated only by&mdash;</p>
