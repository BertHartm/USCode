<p class="note-body">In the interest of achieving greater uniformity with the corresponding FRCP, a number of changes have been made to RCFC 3. First, former subdivision (a) was fully conformed to the FRCP; the reference to RCFC 40.2 calls attention to this court's &ldquo;related case&rdquo; rule. Second, former subdivision (b), which addressed disputes regarding filing dates, was deleted&mdash;both in the interest of uniformity and in the belief that it was inappropriate to include a rule of decision as part of a procedural rule. Third, former subdivision (c) (prescribing a cover sheet and identifying the number of copies required for filing) was moved to RCFC 5.3(d).</p>

In lieu thereof and within the same time period, an original and 7 copies of an amended complaint may be filed in conformity with the rules of this court, setting forth the claim or claims transferred. Service shall be made on the United States as provided in RCFC 4.</p>

At the same time, the clerk shall forward a copy of each such notice to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Procedure After Notice.</strong> After the service of a notice upon the interested person or persons, all further proceedings for the disposition of the case shall be in accordance with the rules prescribed herein for other cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Failure of Party to Appear.</strong> If no interested plaintiff appears to file a complaint within the time specified in the notice served by the clerk, the case shall be submitted to the court upon the papers filed and upon such evidence, if any, as may be produced by the Attorney General.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">An order initiating a contempt proceeding directed at a person other than a party shall be served by a United States marshal, a deputy United States marshal, or a person specially appointed for that purpose, who shall deliver a copy of the order to the person named therein. Proof of such service shall be as provided in RCFC 45(b)(3). All other orders relating to contempt proceedings shall be served in the manner prescribed in RCFC 4 (if against an agent or attorney of the United States) or in RCFC 5 (if against a plaintiff, a plaintiff's representative, or a non-party).</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">New RCFC 4.1 implements the contempt authority granted to this court by &sect;910 of the Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102&ndash;572, 106 Stat. 4506, 4519&ndash;20. That section, now codified at 28 U.S.C. &sect;2521(b), (c) (1994), reads in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(b) The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(1) misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(2) misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(3) disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree or command.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(c) The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have assistance in the carrying out of its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command as is available to a court of the United States. The United States marshal for any district in which the Court of Federal Claims is sitting shall, when requested by the chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims, attend any session of the Court of Federal Claims in such district.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule adopts the mode of service specified in FRCP 4.1, which requires that service of process, other than a summons, be effected upon non-parties through means more formal than mailing. See generally FRCP 4.1 Advisory Committee Notes (recognizing a distinction in service requirements between parties and non-parties); <em>I.A.M. Nat'l Pension Fund v. Wakefield Indus</em>., 699 F.2d 1254, 1259&ndash;62 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (discussing service of contempt orders).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5. Serving and Filing of Pleadings and Other Papers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Service: When Required.</strong> Except as otherwise provided in these rules, every order required by its terms to be served, every pleading subsequent to the original complaint unless the court otherwise orders, every paper relating to discovery required to be served upon a party unless the court otherwise orders, every written motion, and every written notice, appearance, demand, offer of judgment, designation of record on appeal, and similar paper shall be served upon each of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Making Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Service under RCFC 5(a) and 77(d) on a party represented by an attorney is made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Service under RCFC 5(a) is made by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Delivering a copy to the person served by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(i)</strong> handing it to the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ii)</strong> leaving it at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge, or if no one is in charge leaving it in a conspicuous place in the office; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iii)</strong> if the person has no office or the office is closed, leaving it at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion residing there.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Mailing a copy to the last known address of the person served. Service by mail is complete on mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> If the person served has no known address, leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> Delivering a copy by any other means, including electronic means, consented to in writing by the person served. Service by electronic means is complete on transmission; service by other consented means is complete when the person making service delivers the copy to the agency designated to make delivery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Service by electronic means under RCFC 5(b)(2)(D) is not effective if the party making service learns that the attempted service did not reach the person to be served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> Same: Numerous Defendants. [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Filing; Certificate of Service.</strong> All papers after the complaint required to be served upon a party, together with a certificate of service, must be filed with the court within a reasonable time after service, but disclosures under RCFC 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until <!-- PDFPage:409 -->they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: (i) depositions, (ii) interrogatories, (iii) requests for documents or to permit entry upon land, and (iv) requests for admission, except that depositions upon oral examination and notices thereof, written questions, interrogatories, requests for documents, requests for admission, and answers and responses thereto, and other related discovery materials shall not be filed unless on order of the court. See RCFC 83.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Filing With the Court Defined.</strong> The filing of papers with the court as required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court, except that the judge may permit the papers to be filed with the judge, in which event the judge shall note thereon the filing date and forthwith transmit them to the clerk's office. The court may by an amendment to these rules permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance with such amendment constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules. The clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The changes made to RCFC 5 were intended to bring the rule into closer conformity with FRCP 5. Thus, in addition to a change in sequence, changes in text include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the text of subdivision (b) has been modified to reflect the December 1, 2001, changes to the FRCP which significantly affect organization and which also make possible consensual service by electronic means. In addition, the clause &ldquo;but filing is not&rdquo; has been deleted from the last sentence of that subdivision. The deleted language was not in conformity with the FRCP. Filing is not complete on mailing; filing is controlled by subdivisions (d) and (e) of this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, subdivision (e) adopts the language of the FRCP recognizing the appropriateness of permitting papers to be &ldquo;filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes.&rdquo; <em>It should be noted that no decision has yet been made by the court to implement electronic filing. Such a decision, when made, will be accomplished through an amendment to the rules. Until the issuance of such amendment, the clerk's office will not accept electronic filings. Individual chambers, however, may allow counsel to transmit &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; copies of filed documents by electronic means.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Third, subdivision (e) also adds the final sentence from FRCP 5(e) stating that &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules.&rdquo; The addition of this language to the rule was not intended to alter the court's practice of treating all non-conforming complaints as filed upon receipt in the clerk's office while referring other non-conforming papers received in the clerk's office to a judge for instructions as to whether to permit their filing or to require counsel's correction of the papers&rsquo; defects.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, former subdivision (e) titled, &ldquo;Proof of Service,&rdquo; no longer appears in FRCP 5. In order to conform more closely to FRCP 5, former subdivision (e) was deleted from this rule and now appears as RCFC 5.1.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5.3. Form, Size, and Duplication of all Papers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> All papers filed with the clerk shall conform with these rules as to methods of duplication, form, size, and number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Duplication.</strong> All requirements of duplication may be satisfied by the use of any photocopy method capable of producing a clear, black image on white paper, provided that in each instance the duplication shall conform to the requirements of subdivision (c) as to paper, size, form, and pagination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Form and Size.</strong> All papers pursuant to the provisions of this rule shall be duplicated on pages not exceeding 81/2 by 11 inches, with type matter on all papers other than exhibits to be of letter quality. Type size for both text and footnotes shall not be smaller than 12 point and margins shall not be less than 1 on all sides. Papers duplicated shall be double spaced, except that quoted and indented material and footnotes may be single spaced, and, if covering both sides of the sheet, shall be duplicated on paper of sufficient quality that the duplication process does not bleed through the sheet. Except for submissions of fewer than 50 pages, which may be stapled in the upper left-hand margin, all submissions must be bound or attached along the entire left margin in book form and shall have legible margins when bound or attached. Such pages need not be justified on the right margin. All pages, including appendices, shall be numbered. Page numbers shall be in large, distinct type and shall appear in the center of the bottom margin of the page.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Number of Copies.</strong> Plaintiff shall file an original and 7 copies of the complaint, the original of which shall be accompanied by the completed cover sheet as shown in the Appendix of Forms (Form 2) utilizing the Cover Sheet Information. Except as provided in RCFC 58.1, the parties shall file an original and 2 copies of each other paper required by these rules to be filed with the clerk. In congressional reference cases, an original and 4 copies of each such paper shall be filed. All copies shall be identical, or otherwise conformed, to the original.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Date.</strong> Each paper shall bear the date it is signed on the signature page.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Telephone and Facsimile Numbers.</strong> The telephone and facsimile numbers (including area <!-- PDFPage:411 -->code) of the attorney of record must appear beneath the signature line of every pleading or other paper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Name of Judge.</strong> In pleadings and papers other than the complaint, the name of the judge assigned to the case shall be included under the docket number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Bid Protest Cases.</strong> In all pleadings and papers, the words &ldquo;Bid Protest&rdquo; shall be included in the caption under the name of the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">New RCFC 5.3 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 82 and 83. The consolidation and renumbering of RCFC 82 and 83 were intended to reflect their more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the renumbering, the text of former RCFC 82 has been modified in several respects: First, subdivision (a) has been modified by deleting the last sentence of that subdivision which read, &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall refuse to file any paper which is not in substantial conformity with this rule or not in clear type.&rdquo; The deletion corresponds to the change made in RCFC 5(e) directing that &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form.&rdquo; However, as noted in the Advisory Committee Note to FRCP 5(e), the &ldquo;clerk may of course advise a party or counsel that a particular instrument is not in proper form, and may be directed to so inform the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, subdivision (c) has been modified to eliminate certain redundancies, to fix the type size, and to clarify binding and pagination requirements. Appendices will now be subject to pagination. The binding requirement changes were intended to discourage rubber bands, paper clips, and other non-secure binding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, former subdivision (e), now subdivision (f), has been amended to include a requirement listing a facsimile number for the attorney of record.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, subdivision (d) was added to this rule to incorporate the &ldquo;number of copies&rdquo; requirement that formerly appeared as RCFC 83, as well as the requirement formerly found in RCFC 3(c) regarding the number of copies to be filed when filing a complaint.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, subdivision (g) was also added. The text of this subdivision formerly appeared as part of RCFC 10(a).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 6. Time</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Computation.</strong> In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, when the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court, a day on which weather or other conditions have made the clerk's office inaccessible, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. As used in this rule and in RCFC 77(c), &ldquo;legal holiday&rdquo; includes New Year's Day, Inauguration Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and any other day appointed as a holiday by the President or the Congress of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Enlargement.</strong> When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of court an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion (1) with or without motion or notice order the period enlarged if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order, or (2) upon motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect; but it may not extend the time for taking any action under RCFC 52(b), 54(d)(1), 59(b), (d), and (e), and 60(b), except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Unaffected by Expiration of Term.</strong> [Rescinded in federal rule.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) For Motions&mdash;Affidavits.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Additional Time After Service Under RCFC 5(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D).</strong> Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon the party, and the notice or paper is served upon the party under RCFC 5(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D), 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.</p>
