<p class="note-body">Section 188 of the Revised Statutes was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, &sect;201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, &sect;4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171&ndash;1), which provides &ldquo;Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense&rdquo; is omitted from this title but is not repealed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;his opinions&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the opinions of the law officers herein authorized to be given&rdquo; as the opinions of the Attorney General are his and only his and the reference to other &ldquo;law officers&rdquo; is misleading. All functions of all other officers of the Department of Justice were transferred to the Attorney General by 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 2, &sect;1, eff. May 14, 1950, 64 Stat. 1261. The word &ldquo;considers&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;may deem&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the last sentence, the words &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and &ldquo;complete and full&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
