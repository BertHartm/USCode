<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;552 (Feb. 11, 1925, ch. 204, &sect;5, 43 Stat. 857; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, &sect;1, 45 Stat. 54; Sept. 27, 1944, ch. 414, &sect;3, 58 Stat. 744).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;to the clerk of the district court&rdquo; were added to clarify the intent of Congress, as shown by the title of the 1944 act containing this section, and by the text of such Act in its entirety.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:451 --><p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;as an additional fee in said suit or action, or proceeding in bankruptcy&rdquo; were omitted. The entire text of the basic 1944 act shows that Congress intended it to apply to all actions, suits and proceedings, including bankruptcy proceedings, and nowhere else in such act is any reference made to bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
