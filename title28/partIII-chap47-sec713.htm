<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;547, and section 11&ndash;204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., (Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, &sect;9, 26 Stat. 829; Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, &sect;4, 27 Stat. 435; July 30, 1894, ch. 172, &sect;1, 28 Stat. 160; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, &sect;224, 31 Stat. 1224; June 30, 1902, ch. 1329, 32 Stat. 528; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167; Aug. 23, 1912, ch. 350, 37 Stat. 412; Feb. 22, 1921, ch. 70, &sect;7, 41 Stat. 1144; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488; May 21, 1928, ch. 659, 45 Stat. 645).</p>

<p class="note-body">The Judicial Code provided for the appointment of assistants and messengers in the Supreme Court, criers and &ldquo;persons to wait upon juries&rdquo; in the district courts, a messenger in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and a bailiff and a chief messenger in the Court of Claims (see title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;9, 244, 305, 331) and also provided (see same title, &sect;547) that criers, bailiffs and messengers of the courts of appeals should be allowed the same compensation as allowed for similar services in the district courts, but did not provide for the appointment of said criers, bailiffs and messengers. This section authorizes such appointments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of section 224 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the United States marshal shall provide for the expenses of criers, bailiffs and messengers for the circuit courts of appeals are superseded by sections 601&ndash;610 of this title vesting such functions in the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 11&ndash;204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., relating to appointment and compensation of clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia are incorporated in sections 711 and 604 of this title, respectively. Other provisions of such section were retained in the District of Columbia Code. (See reviser's note under section 604 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Compensation of bailiffs is provided by section 755 of this title. Other provisions of section 547 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to compensation of criers, clerks, and messengers are incorporated in section 604 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Marshal for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was authorized by the District of Columbia Appropriation Act of June 29, 1937, 50 Stat. 378.</p>
<p class="note-body">The duties of criers and bailiffs are made specific consistently with section 755 of this title, and existing administrative practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The removal provisions are added to make this section consistent with the same provisions in other sections relating to tenure of court officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in phraseology and arrangement were made.</p>
