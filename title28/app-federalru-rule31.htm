<h3 class="section-head">Rule 31. Filing and Service of a Brief</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>Time for serving and filing briefs</em>.&mdash;The appellant shall serve and file a brief within 40 days after the date on which the record is filed. The appellee shall serve and file a brief within 30 days after service of the brief of the appellant. <!-- PDFPage:37 -->The appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 14 days after service of the brief of the appellee, but, except for good cause shown, a reply brief must be filed at least 3 days before argument. If a court of appeals is prepared to consider cases on the merits promptly after briefs are filed, and its practice is to do so, it may shorten the periods prescribed above for serving and filing briefs, either by rule for all cases or for classes of cases, or by order for specific cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Number of Copies to Be Filed and Served</em>.&mdash;Twenty-five copies of each brief must be filed with the clerk, and two copies must be served on counsel for each party separately represented unless the court requires the filing or service of a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case. If a party is allowed to file typewritten ribbon and carbon copies of the brief, the original and three legible copies must be filed with the clerk, and one copy must be served on counsel for each party separately represented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <em>Consequence of failure to file briefs</em>.&mdash;If an appellant fails to file a brief within the time provided by this rule, or within the time as extended, an appellee may move for dismissal of the appeal. If an appellee fails to file a brief, the appellee will not be heard at oral argument except by permission of the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">A majority of the circuits now require the brief of the appellant to be filed within 30 days from the date on which the record is filed. But in those circuits an exchange of designations is unnecessary in the preparation of the appendix. The appellant files with his brief an appendix containing the parts of the record which he deems essential. If the appellee considers other parts essential, he includes those parts in his own appendix. Since the proposed rule requires the appellant to file with his brief an appendix containing necessary parts of the record as designated by both parties, the rule allows the appellant 40 days in order to provide time for the exchange of designations respecting the content of the appendix (see Rule 30(b)).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The time prescribed by Rule 31(a) for preparing briefs&mdash;40 days to the appellant, 30 days to the appellee&mdash;is well within the time that must ordinarily elapse in most circuits before an appeal can be reached for consideration. In those circuits, the time prescribed by the Rule should not be disturbed. But if a court of appeals maintains a current calendar, that is, if an appeal can be heard as soon as the briefs have been filed, or if the practice of the court permits the submission of appeals for preliminary consideration as soon as the briefs have been filed, the court should be free to prescribe shorter periods in the interest of expediting decision.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rules 31(a) and (c) are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The amendment allows a court of appeals to require the filing of a greater, as well as a lesser, number of copies of briefs. The amendment also allows the required number to be prescribed by local rule as well as by order in a particular case.</p>
