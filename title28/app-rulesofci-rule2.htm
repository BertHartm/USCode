<p class="note-body">1. This rule modifies U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;384 (Suits in equity, when not sustainable). U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;&sect;723 and 730 [see 2071 et seq.] (conferring power on the Supreme Court to make rules of practice in equity), are unaffected insofar as they relate to the rule making power in admiralty. These sections, together with &sect;723b [see 2072] (Rules in actions at law; Supreme Court authorized to make) are continued insofar as they are not inconsistent with &sect;723c [see 2072] (Union of equity and action at law rules; power of Supreme Court). See Note 3 to Rule 1. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;724 (Conformity act), 397 (Amendments to pleadings when case brought to wrong side of court) and 398 (Equitable defenses and equitable relief in actions at law) are superseded.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Reference to actions at law or suits in equity in all statutes should now be treated as referring to the civil action prescribed in these rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. This rule follows in substance the usual introductory statements to code practices which provide for a single action and mode of procedure, with abolition of <!-- PDFPage:79 -->forms of action and procedural distinctions. Representative statutes are N.Y. Code 1848 (Laws 1848, ch. 379) &sect;62; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;8; Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;307; 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9164; 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;&sect;153, 255.</p>
