<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition; Form.</cap-smallcap> &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment should not include recitals of pleadings, a master's report, or a record of prior proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Judgment on Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties.</cap-smallcap> When an action presents more than one claim for relief&mdash;whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim&mdash;or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties&rsquo; rights and liabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Demand for Judgment; Relief to Be Granted.</cap-smallcap> A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings. Every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Costs; Attorney's Fees.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Costs Other Than Attorney's Fees.</em> Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs&mdash;other than attorney's fees&mdash;should be allowed to the prevailing party. But costs against the United States, its officers, and its agencies may be imposed only to the extent allowed by law. The clerk may tax costs on 14 days&rsquo; notice. On motion served within the next 7 days, the court may review the clerk's action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Attorney's Fees.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Claim to Be by Motion.</em> A claim for attorney's fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Timing and Contents of the Motion.</em> Unless a statute or a court order provides otherwise, the motion must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the movant to the award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) state the amount sought or provide a fair estimate of it; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) disclose, if the court so orders, the terms of any agreement about fees for the services for which the claim is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Proceedings.</em> Subject to Rule 23(h), the court must, on a party's request, give an opportunity for adversary submissions on the motion in accordance with Rule 43(c) or 78. The court may decide issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions on the value of services. The court must find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in Rule 52(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Special Procedures by Local Rule; Reference to a Master or a Magistrate Judge.</em> By local rule, the court may establish special procedures to resolve fee-related issues without extensive evidentiary hearings. Also, the court may refer issues concerning the value of services to a special master under Rule 53 without regard to the limitations of Rule 53(a)(1), and may refer a motion for attorney's fees to a magistrate judge under Rule 72(b) as if it were a dispositive pretrial matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <em>Exceptions.</em> Subparagraphs (A)&ndash;(D) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violating these rules or as sanctions under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. The second sentence is derived substantially from [former] Equity Rule 71 (Form of Decree).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. This provides for the separate judgment of equity and code practice. See Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;270.54; Compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;476.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c)</em>. For the limitation on default contained in the first sentence, see 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7680; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;479. Compare <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 13, r.r. 3&ndash;12. The remainder is a usual <!-- PDFPage:256 -->code provision. It makes clear that a judgment should give the relief to which a party is entitled, regardless of whether it is legal or equitable or both. This necessarily includes the deficiency judgment in foreclosure cases formerly provided for by Equity Rule 10 (Decree for Deficiency in Foreclosures, Etc.).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. For the present rule in common law actions, see <em>Ex parte Peterson</em>, 253 U.S. 300, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920); Payne, <em>Costs in Common Law Actions in the Federal Courts</em> (1935), 21 Va.L.Rev. 397.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The historic rule in the federal courts has always prohibited piecemeal disposal of litigation and permitted appeals only from final judgments except in those special instances covered by statute. <em>Hohorst v. Hamburg-American Packet Co</em>. (1893) 148 U.S. 262; <em>Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co</em>. (1913) 228 U.S. 339; <em>Collins v. Miller</em> (1920) 252 U.S. 364. Rule 54(b) was originally adopted in view of the wide scope and possible content of the newly created &ldquo;civil action&rdquo; in order to avoid the possible injustice of a delay in judgment of a distinctly separate claim to await adjudication of the entire case. It was not designed to overturn the settled federal rule stated above, which, indeed, has more recently been reiterated in <em>Catlin v. United States</em> (1945) 324 U.S. 229. See also <em>United States v. Florian</em> (1941) 312 U.S. 656, rev'g (and restoring the first opinion in) <em>Florian v. United States</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1940) 114 F.(2d) 990; <em>Reeves v. Beardall</em> (1942) 316 U.S. 283.</p>
<p class="note-body">Unfortunately, this was not always understood, and some confusion ensued. Hence situations arose where district courts made a piecemeal disposition of an action and entered what the parties thought amounted to a judgment, although a trial remained to be had on other claims similar or identical with those disposed of. In the interim the parties did not know their ultimate rights, and accordingly took an appeal, thus putting the finality of the partial judgment in question. While most appellate courts have reached a result generally in accord with the intent of the rule, yet there have been divergent precedents and division of views which have served to render the issues more clouded to the parties appellant. It hardly seems a case where multiplicity of precedents will tend to remove the problem from debate. The problem is presented and discussed in the following cases: <em>Atwater v. North American Coal Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 125; <em>Rosenblum v. Dingfelder</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 406; <em>Audi-Vision, Inc. v. RCA Mfg. Co., Inc</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 621; <em>Zalkind v. Scheinman</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 139 F.(2d) 895; <em>Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young & Co., Inc</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 144 F.(2d) 387; <em>Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Industrial Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 814, cert. den. (1946) 66 S.Ct. 1353; <em>Zarati Steamship Co. v. Park Bridge Corp</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 377; <em>Baltimore and Ohio R. Co. v. United Fuel Gas Co</em>. (C.C.A.4th, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 545; <em>Jefferson Electric Co. v. Sola Electric Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1941) 122 F.(2d) 124; <em>Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1942) 130 F.(2d) 535; <em>Markham v. Kasper</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1945) 152 F.(2d) 270; <em>Hanney v. Franklin Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia</em> (C.C.A.9th, 1944) 142 F.(2d) 864; <em>Toomey v. Toomey</em> (App.D.C. 1945) 149 F.(2d) 19.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of the difficulty thus disclosed, the Advisory Committee in its two preliminary drafts of proposed amendments attempted to redefine the original rule with particular stress upon the interlocutory nature of partial judgments which did not adjudicate all claims arising out of a single transaction or occurrence. This <!-- PDFPage:257 -->attempt appeared to meet with almost universal approval from those of the profession commenting upon it, although there were, of course, helpful suggestions for additional changes in language or clarification of detail. But <em>cf</em>. Circuit Judge Frank's dissenting opinion in <em>Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Industrial Corp., supra</em>, n. 21 of the dissenting opinion. The Committee, however, became convinced on careful study of its own proposals that the seeds of ambiguity still remained, and that it had not completely solved the problem of piecemeal appeals. After extended consideration, it concluded that a retention of the older federal rule was desirable, and that this rule needed only the exercise of a discretionary power to afford a remedy in the infrequent harsh case to provide a simple, definite, workable rule. This is afforded by amended Rule 54(b). It re-establishes an ancient policy with clarity and precision. For the possibility of staying execution where not all claims are disposed of under Rule 54(b), see amended Rule 62(h).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1961 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule permitting appeal, upon the trial court's determination of &ldquo;no just reason for delay,&rdquo; from a judgment upon one or more but fewer than all the claims in an action, has generally been given a sympathetic construction by the courts and its validity is settled. <em>Reeves v. Beardall</em>, 316 U.S. 283 (1942); <em>Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey</em>, 351 U.S. 427 (1956); <em>Cold Metal Process Co. v. United Engineering & Foundry Co</em>., 351 U.S. 445 (1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">A serious difficulty has, however, arisen because the rule speaks of claims but nowhere mentions parties. A line of cases has developed in the circuits consistently holding the rule to be inapplicable to the dismissal, even with the requisite trial court determination, of one or more but fewer than all defendants jointly charged in an action, <em>i.e</em>. charged with various forms of concerted or related wrongdoing or related liability. See <em>Mull v. Ackerman</em>, 279 F.2d 25 (2d Cir. 1960); <em>Richards v. Smith</em>, 276 F.2d 652 (5th Cir. 1960); <em>Hardy v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co</em>., 222 F.2d 827 (7th Cir. 1955); <em>Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp</em>., 220 F.2d 105 (9th Cir. 1955). For purposes of Rule 54(b) it was arguable that there were as many &ldquo;claims&rdquo; as there were parties defendant and that the rule in its present text applied where less than all of the parties were dismissed, <em>cf. United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc</em>., 221 F.2d 213, 215 (2d Cir. 1955); <em>Bowling Machines, Inc. v. First Nat. Bank</em>, 283 F.2d 39 (1st Cir. 1960); but the Courts of Appeals are now committed to an opposite view.</p>
<p class="note-body">The danger of hardship through delay of appeal until the whole action is concluded may be at least as serious in the multiple-parties situations as in multiple-claims cases, see <em>Pabellon v. Grace Line, Inc</em>., 191 F.2d 169, 179 (2d Cir. 1951), <em>cert. denied</em>, 342 U.S. 893 (1951), and courts and commentators have urged that Rule 54(b) be changed to take in the former. See <em>Reagan v. Traders & General Ins. Co</em>., 255 F.2d 845 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Meadows v. Greyhound Corp</em>., 235 F.2d 233 (5th Cir. 1956); <em>Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., supra</em>; 6 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;54.34[2] (2d ed. 1953); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;1193.2 (Wright ed. 1958); <em>Developments in the Law&mdash;Multiparty Litigation</em>, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 874, 981 (1958); Note, 62 Yale L.J. 263, 271 (1953); Ill.Ann.Stat. ch. 110, &sect;50(2) (Smith-Hurd 1956). The amendment accomplishes this purpose by referring explicitly to parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">There has been some recent indication that interlocutory appeal under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b), added in 1958, may now be available for the multiple-parties cases here considered. See <em>Jaftex Corp. v. Randolph Mills, Inc</em>., 282 F.2d 508 (2d Cir. 1960). The Rule 54(b) procedure seems preferable for those cases, and &sect;1292(b) should be held inapplicable to them when the rule is enlarged as here proposed. See <em>Luckenbach Steamship Co., Inc., v. H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc</em>., 280 F.2d 755, 757 (2d Cir. 1960); 1 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>supra</em>, &sect;58.1, p. 321 (Wright ed. 1960).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This revision adds paragraph (2) to this subdivision to provide for a frequently recurring form of litigation not initially contemplated by the rules&mdash;disputes over the amount of attorneys&rsquo; fees to be awarded in the large number of actions in which prevailing parties may be entitled to such awards or in which the court must determine the fees to be paid from a common fund. This revision seeks to harmonize and clarify procedures that have been developed through case law and local rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. Former subdivision (d), providing for taxation of costs by the clerk, is renumbered as paragraph (1) and revised to exclude applications for attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em>. This new paragraph establishes a procedure for presenting claims for attorneys&rsquo; fees, whether or not denominated as &ldquo;costs.&rdquo; It applies also to requests for reimbursement of expenses, not taxable as costs, when recoverable under governing law incident to the award of fees. <em>Cf. West Virginia Univ. Hosp. v. Casey</em>, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; U.S. &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (1991), holding, prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, that expert witness fees were not recoverable under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1988. As noted in subparagraph (A), it does not, however, apply to fees recoverable as an element of damages, as when sought under the terms of a contract; such damages typically are to be claimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be resolved by a jury. Nor, as provided in subparagraph (E), does it apply to awards of fees as sanctions authorized or mandated under these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (B) provides a deadline for motions for attorneys&rsquo; fees&mdash;14 days after final judgment unless the court or a statute specifies some other time. One purpose of this provision is to assure that the opposing party is informed of the claim before the time for appeal has elapsed. Prior law did not prescribe any specific time limit on claims for attorneys&rsquo; fees. <em>White v. New Hampshire Dep't of Employment Sec</em>., 455 U.S. 445 (1982). In many nonjury cases the court will want to consider attorneys&rsquo; fee issues immediately after rendering its judgment on the merits of the case. Note that the time for making claims is specifically stated in some legislation, such as the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(d)(1)(B) (30-day filing period).</p>
<p class="note-body">Prompt filing affords an opportunity for the court to resolve fee disputes shortly after trial, while the services performed are freshly in mind. It also enables the court in appropriate circumstances to make its ruling on a fee request in time for any appellate review of a dispute over fees to proceed at the same time as review on the merits of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Filing a motion for fees under this subdivision does not affect the finality or the appealability of a judgment, though revised Rule 58 provides a mechanism by which prior to appeal the court can suspend the finality to resolve a motion for fees. If an appeal on the merits of the case is taken, the court may rule on the claim for fees, may defer its ruling on the motion, or may deny the motion without prejudice, directing under subdivision (d)(2)(B) a new period for filing after the appeal has been resolved. A notice of appeal does not extend the time for filing a fee claim based on the initial judgment, but the court under subdivision (d)(2)(B) may effectively extend the period by permitting claims to be filed after resolution of the appeal. A new period for filing will automatically begin if a new judgment is entered following a reversal or remand by the appellate court or the granting of a motion under Rule 59.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not require that the motion be supported at the time of filing with the evidentiary material bearing on the fees. This material must of course <!-- PDFPage:258 -->be submitted in due course, according to such schedule as the court may direct in light of the circumstances of the case. What is required is the filing of a motion sufficient to alert the adversary and the court that there is a claim for fees and the amount of such fees (or a fair estimate).</p>
<p class="note-body">If directed by the court, the moving party is also required to disclose any fee agreement, including those between attorney and client, between attorneys sharing a fee to be awarded, and between adversaries made in partial settlement of a dispute where the settlement must be implemented by court action as may be required by Rules 23(e) and 23.1 or other like provisions. With respect to the fee arrangements requiring court approval, the court may also by local rule require disclosure immediately after such arrangements are agreed to. <em>E.g</em>., Rule 5 of United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York; <em>cf. In re &ldquo;Agent Orange&rdquo; Product Liability Litigation (MDL 381)</em>, 611 F. Supp. 1452, 1464 (E.D.N.Y. 1985).</p>
<p class="note-body">In the settlement of class actions resulting in a common fund from which fees will be sought, courts frequently have required that claims for fees be presented in advance of hearings to consider approval of the proposed settlement. The rule does not affect this practice, as it permits the court to require submissions of fee claims in advance of entry of judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (C) assures the parties of an opportunity to make an appropriate presentation with respect to issues involving the evaluation of legal services. In some cases, an evidentiary hearing may be needed, but this is not required in every case. The amount of time to be allowed for the preparation of submissions both in support of and in opposition to awards should be tailored to the particular case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court is explicitly authorized to make a determination of the liability for fees before receiving submissions by the parties bearing on the amount of an award. This option may be appropriate in actions in which the liability issue is doubtful and the evaluation issues are numerous and complex.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may order disclosure of additional information, such as that bearing on prevailing local rates or on the appropriateness of particular services for which compensation is sought.</p>
<p class="note-body">On rare occasion, the court may determine that discovery under Rules 26&ndash;37 would be useful to the parties. <em>Compare</em> Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the U.S. District Courts, Rule 6. <em>See</em> Note, <em>Determining the Reasonableness of Attorneys&rsquo; Fees&mdash;the Discoverability of Billing Records</em>, 64 <em>B.U.L. Rev</em>. 241 (1984). In complex fee disputes, the court may use case management techniques to limit the scope of the dispute or to facilitate the settlement of fee award disputes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fee awards should be made in the form of a separate judgment under Rule 58 since such awards are subject to review in the court of appeals. To facilitate review, the paragraph provides that the court set forth its findings and conclusions as under Rule 52(a), though in most cases this explanation could be quite brief.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (D) explicitly authorizes the court to establish procedures facilitating the efficient and fair resolution of fee claims. A local rule, for example, might call for matters to be presented through affidavits, or might provide for issuance of proposed findings by the court, which would be treated as accepted by the parties unless objected to within a specified time. A court might also consider establishing a schedule reflecting customary fees or factors affecting fees within the community, as implicitly suggested by Justice O'Connor in <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens&rsquo; Council</em>, 483 U.S. 711, 733 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (how particular markets compensate for contingency). <em>Cf. Thompson v. Kennickell</em>, 710 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1989) (use of findings in other cases to promote consistency). The parties, of course, should be permitted to show that in the circumstances of the case such a schedule should not be applied or that different hourly rates would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule also explicitly permits, without need for a local rule, the court to refer issues regarding the amount of a fee award in a particular case to a master under Rule 53. The district judge may designate a magistrate judge to act as a master for this purpose or may refer a motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees to a magistrate judge for proposed findings and recommendations under Rule 72(b). This authorization eliminates any controversy as to whether such references are permitted under Rule 53(b) as &ldquo;matters of account and of difficult computation of damages&rdquo; and whether motions for attorneys&rsquo; fees can be treated as the equivalent of a dispositive pretrial matter that can be referred to a magistrate judge. For consistency and efficiency, all such matters might be referred to the same magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (E) excludes from this rule the award of fees as sanctions under these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(2)(C) is amended to delete the requirement that judgment on a motion for attorney fees be set forth in a separate document. This change complements the amendment of Rule 58(a)(1), which deletes the separate document requirement for an order disposing of a motion for attorney fees under Rule 54. These changes are made to support amendment of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. It continues to be important that a district court make clear its meaning when it intends an order to be the final disposition of a motion for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement in subdivision (d)(2)(B) that a motion for attorney fees be not only filed but also served no later than 14 days after entry of judgment is changed to require filing only, to establish a parallel with Rules 50, 52, and 59. Service continues to be required under Rule 5(a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 54(d)(2)(D) is revised to reflect amendments to Rule 53.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 54 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;or class member&rdquo; have been removed from Rule 54(d)(2)(C) because Rule 23(h)(2) now addresses objections by class members to attorney-fee motions. Rule 54(d)(2)(C) is amended to recognize that Rule 23(h) now controls those aspects of attorney-fee motions in class actions to which it is addressed.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 54(d)(1) provided that the clerk may tax costs on 1 day's notice. That period was unrealistically short. The new 14-day period provides a better opportunity to prepare and present a response. The former 5-day period to serve a motion to review the clerk's action is extended to 7 days to reflect the change in the Rule 6(a) method for computing periods of less than 11 days.</p>

For dismissal of an action for failure to comply with these rules or any order of the court, see rule 41(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. The provision for the entry of default comes from the Massachusetts practice, 2 Mass.Gen.Laws (Ter.Ed., 1932) ch. 231, &sect;57. For affidavit of default, see 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9256.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. The provision in paragraph (1) for the entry of judgment by the clerk when plaintiff claims a sum certain is found in the N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;485, in Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;585(1), and in Conn.Practice Book (1934) &sect;47.

(Remington, 1932) &sect;411(2). U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;785 (Action to recover forfeiture in bond) and similar statutes are preserved by the last clause of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e)</em>. This restates substantially the last clause of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;763 (Action against the United States under the Tucker Act). As this rule governs in all actions against the United States, U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;45 (Practice and procedure in certain cases under the interstate commerce laws) and similar statutes are modified insofar as they contain anything inconsistent therewith.</p>

<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 55 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 55(a) directed the clerk to enter a default when a party failed to plead or otherwise defend &ldquo;as provided by these rules.&rdquo; The implication from the reference to defending &ldquo;as provided by these rules&rdquo; seemed to be that the clerk should enter a default even if a party did something showing an intent to defend, but that act was not specifically described by the rules. Courts in fact have rejected that implication. Acts that show an intent to defend have frequently prevented a default even though not connected to any particular rule. &ldquo;[A]s provided by these rules&rdquo; is deleted to reflect Rule 55(a)'s actual meaning.</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended Rule 55 omits former Rule 55(d), which included two provisions. The first recognized that Rule 55 applies to described claimants. The list was incomplete and unnecessary.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>By a Claiming Party.</cap-smallcap> A party claiming relief may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>By a Defending Party.</cap-smallcap> A party against whom relief is sought may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Time for a Motion, Response, and Reply; Proceedings.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) These times apply unless a different time is set by local rule or the court orders otherwise:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a party may move for summary judgment at any time until 30 days after the close of all discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a party opposing the motion must file a response within 21 days after the motion is served or a responsive pleading is due, whichever is later; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the movant may file a reply within 14 days after the response is served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Establishing Facts.</em> If summary judgment is not rendered on the whole action, the court should, to the extent practicable, determine what material facts are not genuinely at issue. The court should so determine by examining the pleadings and evidence before it and by interrogating the attorneys. It should then issue an order specifying what facts&mdash;including items of damages or other relief&mdash;are not genuinely at issue. The facts so specified must be treated as established in the action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> A supporting or opposing affidavit must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters stated. If a paper or part of a paper is referred to in an affidavit, a sworn or certified copy must be attached to or served with the affidavit. The court may permit an affidavit to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or additional affidavits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Opposing Party's Obligation to Respond.</em> When a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must&mdash;by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule&mdash;set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so respond, summary judgment should, if appropriate, be entered against that party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>When Affidavits Are Unavailable.</cap-smallcap> If a party opposing the motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deny the motion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) order a continuance to enable affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be taken, or other discovery to be undertaken; or</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is applicable to all actions, including those against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">Summary judgment procedure is a method for promptly disposing of actions in which there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. It has been extensively used in England for more than 50 years and has been adopted in a number of American states. New York, for example, has made great use of it. During the first nine years after its adoption there, the records of New York county alone show 5,600 applications for summary judgments. <em>Report of the Commission on the Administration of Justice in New York State</em> (1934), p. 383. See also <em>Third Annual Report of the Judicial Council of the State of New York</em> (1937), p. 30.</p>
<p class="note-body">In England it was first employed only in cases of liquidated claims, but there has been a steady enlargement of the scope of the remedy until it is now used in actions to recover land or chattels and in all other actions at law, for liquidated or unliquidated claims, except for a few designated torts and breach of promise of marriage. <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 3, r. 6; Orders 14, 14A, and 15; see also O. 32, r. 6, authorizing an application for judgment at any time upon admissions. In Michigan (3 Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;14260) and Illinois (Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;&sect;181, 259.15, 259.16), it is not limited to liquidated demands. New York (N.Y.R.C.P. (1937) Rule 113; see also Rule 107) has brought so many classes of actions under the operation of the rule that the Commission on Administration of Justice in New York State (1934) recommend that all restrictions be removed and that the remedy be available &ldquo;in any action&rdquo; (p. 287). For the history and nature of the summary judgment procedure and citations of state statutes, see Clark and Samenow, <em>The Summary Judgment</em> (1929), 38 Yale L.J. 423.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. See Rule 16 (Pre-Trial Procedure; Formulating Issues) and the <em>Note</em> thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions (e) and (f)</em>. These are similar to rules in Michigan. Mich.Court Rules Ann. (Searl, 1933) Rule 30.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment allows a claimant to move for a summary judgment at any time after the expiration of 20 days from the commencement of the action or after service of a motion for summary judgment by the adverse party. This will normally operate to permit an earlier motion by the claimant than under the original rule, where the phrase &ldquo;at any time after the pleading in answer thereto has been served&rdquo; operates to prevent a claimant from moving for summary judgment, even in a case clearly proper for its exercise, until a formal answer has been filed. Thus in <em>Peoples Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</em> (N.D.Cal. 1944) 58 F.Supp. 25, the plaintiff's counter-motion for a summary judgment was stricken as premature, because the defendant had not filed an answer. Since Rule 12(a) allows at least 20 days for an answer, that time plus the 10 days required in Rule 56(c) means that under original Rule 56(a) a minimum period of 30 days necessarily has to elapse in every case before the claimant can be heard on his right to a summary judgment. An extension of time by the court or the service of preliminary motions of any kind will prolong that period even further. In many cases this merely represents unnecessary delay. See <em>United States v. Adler's Creamery, Inc</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1939) 107 F.(2d) 987. The changes are in the interest of more expeditious litigation. The 20-day period, as provided, gives the defendant an opportunity to secure counsel and determine a course of action. But in a case where the defendant himself serves a motion for summary judgment within that time, there is no reason to restrict the plaintiff and the amended rule so provides.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment of Rule 56(c), by the addition of the final sentence, resolves a doubt expressed in <em>Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp</em>. (1944) 321 U.S. 620. See also Commentary, <em>Summary Judgment as to Damages</em> (1944) 7 Fed.Rules Serv. 974; <em>Madeirense Do Brasil S/A v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1945) 147 F.(2d) 399, cert. den. (1945) 325 U.S. 861. It makes clear that although the question of recovery depends on the amount of damages, the summary judgment rule is ap<!-- PDFPage:261 -->plicable and summary judgment may be granted in a proper case. If the case is not fully adjudicated it may be dealt with as provided in subdivision (d) of Rule 56, and the right to summary recovery determined by a preliminary order, interlocutory in character, and the precise amount of recovery left for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Rule 54(a) defines &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; as including a decree and &ldquo;any order from which an appeal lies.&rdquo; Subdivision (d) of Rule 56 indicates clearly, however, that a partial summary &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; is not a final judgment, and, therefore, that it is not appealable, unless in the particular case some statute allows an appeal from the interlocutory order involved. The partial summary judgment is merely a pretrial adjudication that certain issues shall be deemed established for the trial of the case. This adjudication is more nearly akin to the preliminary order under Rule 16, and likewise serves the purpose of speeding up litigation by eliminating before trial matters wherein there is no genuine issue of fact. See <em>Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1942) 130 F.(2d) 535; <em>Biggins v. Oltmer Iron Works</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 214; 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938). 3190&ndash;3192. Since interlocutory appeals are not allowed, except where specifically provided by statute (see 3 <em>Moore, op. cit. supra</em>, 3155&ndash;3156) this interpretation is in line with that policy, <em>Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra</em>. See also <em>Audi Vision Inc., v. RCA Mfg. Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 621; <em>Toomey v. Toomey</em> (App.D.C. 1945) 149 F.(2d) 19; <em>Biggins v.

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. By the amendment &ldquo;answers to interrogatories&rdquo; are included among the materials which may be considered on motion for summary judgment. The phrase was inadvertently omitted from the rule, see 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 159&ndash;60 (Wright ed. 1958), and the courts have generally reached by interpretation the result which will hereafter be required by the text of the amended rule. See Annot., 74 A.L.R.2d 984 (1960).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The words &ldquo;answers to interrogatories&rdquo; are added in the third sentence of this subdivision to conform to the amendment of subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last two sentences are added to overcome a line of cases, chiefly in the Third Circuit, which has impaired the utility of the summary judgment device. A typical case is as follows: A party supports his motion for summary judgment by affidavits or other evidentiary matters sufficient to show that there is no genuine issue as to a material fact. The adverse party, in opposing the motion, does not produce any evidentiary matter, or produces some but not enough to establish that there is a genuine issue for trial. Instead, the adverse party rests on averments of his pleadings which on their face present an issue. In this situation Third Circuit cases have taken the view that summary judgment must be denied, at least if the averments are &ldquo;well-pleaded,&rdquo; and not suppositious, conclusory, or ultimate. See <em>Frederick Hart & Co., Inc. v. Recordgraph Corp</em>., 169 F.2d 580 (3d Cir. 1948); <em>United States ex rel. Kolton v. Halpern</em>, 260 F.2d 590 (3d Cir. 1958); <em>United States ex rel. Nobles v. Ivey Bros. Constr. Co., Inc</em>., 191 F.Supp. 383 (D.Del. 1961); <em>Jamison v. Pennsylvania Salt Mfg. Co</em>., 22 F.R.D. 238 (W.D.Pa. 1958); <em>Bunny Bear, Inc. v. Dennis Mitchell Industries</em>, 139 F.Supp. 542 (E.D.Pa. 1956); <em>Levy v. Equitable Life Assur. Society</em>, 18 F.R.D. 164 (E.D.Pa. 1955).</p>
<p class="note-body">The very mission of the summary judgment procedure is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial. The Third Circuit doctrine, which permits the pleadings themselves to stand in the way of granting an otherwise justified summary judgment, is incompatible with the basic purpose of the rule. See 6 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> 2069 (2d ed. 1953); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, &sect;1235.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is hoped that the amendment will contribute to the more effective utilization of the salutary device of summary judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is not intended to derogate from the solemnity of the pleadings. Rather it recognizes that, despite the best efforts of counsel to make his pleadings accurate, they may be overwhelmingly contradicted by the proof available to his adversary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nor is the amendment designed to affect the ordinary standards applicable to the summary judgment motion. So, for example: Where an issue as to a material fact cannot be resolved without observation of the demeanor of witnesses in order to evaluate their credibility, summary judgment is not appropriate. Where the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented. And summary judgment may be inappropriate where the party opposing it shows under subdivision (f) that he cannot at the time present facts essential to justify his opposition.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 56 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 56(a) and (b) referred to summary-judgment motions on or against a claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim, or to obtain a declaratory judgment. The list was incomplete. Rule 56 applies to third-party claimants, intervenors, claimants in interpleader, and others. Amended Rule 56(a) and (b) carry forward the present meaning by referring to a party claiming relief and a party against whom relief is sought.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 56(c), (d), and (e) stated circumstances in which summary judgment &ldquo;shall be rendered,&rdquo; the court &ldquo;shall if practicable&rdquo; ascertain facts existing without substantial controversy, and &ldquo;if appropriate, shall&rdquo; enter summary judgment. In each place &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;should.&rdquo; It is established that although there is no discretion to enter summary judgment when there is a genuine issue as to any material fact, there is discretion to deny summary judgment when it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. <em>Kennedy v. Silas Mason Co.</em>, 334 U.S. 249, 256&ndash;257 (1948). Many lower court decisions are gathered in 10A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 3d, &sect;2728. &ldquo;Should&rdquo; in amended Rule 56(c) recognizes that courts will seldom exercise the discretion to deny summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Similarly sparing exercise of this discretion is appropriate under Rule 56(e)(2). Rule 56(d)(1), on the other hand, reflects the more open-ended discretion to decide whether it is practicable to determine what material facts are not genuinely at issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 56(d) used a variety of different phrases to express the Rule 56(c) standard for summary judgment&mdash;that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Amended Rule 56(d) adopts terms directly parallel to Rule 56(c).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The timing provisions for summary judgment are outmoded. They are consolidated and substantially revised in new subdivision (c)(1). The new rule allows a party to move for summary judgment at any time, even as early as the commencement of the action. If the motion seems premature both subdivision (c)(1) and Rule 6(b) allow the court to extend the time to respond. The rule does set a presumptive deadline at 30 days after the close of all discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">The presumptive timing rules are default provisions that may be altered by an order in the case or by local rule. Scheduling orders are likely to supersede the rule <!-- PDFPage:262 -->provisions in most cases, deferring summary-judgment motions until a stated time or establishing different deadlines. Scheduling orders tailored to the needs of the specific case, perhaps adjusted as it progresses, are likely to work better than default rules. A scheduling order may be adjusted to adopt the parties&rsquo; agreement on timing, or may require that discovery and motions occur in stages&mdash;including separation of expert-witness discovery from other discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">Local rules may prove useful when local docket conditions or practices are incompatible with the general Rule 56 timing provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a motion for summary judgment is filed before a responsive pleading is due from a party affected by the motion, the time for responding to the motion is 21 days after the responsive pleading is due.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2201. Rules 38 and 39 govern a demand for a jury trial. The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate. The court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory-judgment action.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">The fact that a declaratory judgment may be granted &ldquo;whether or not further relief is or could be prayed&rdquo; indicates that declaratory relief is alternative or cumulative and not exclusive or extraordinary. A declaratory judgment is appropriate when it will &ldquo;terminate the controversy&rdquo; giving rise to the proceeding. Inasmuch as it often involves only an issue of law on undisputed or relatively undisputed facts, it operates frequently as a summary proceeding, justifying docketing the case for early hearing as on a motion, as provided for in California (Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;1062a), Michigan (3 Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;13904), and Kentucky (Codes (Carroll, 1932) Civ.Pract. &sect;639a&ndash;3).</p>
<p class="note-body">The &ldquo;controversy&rdquo; must necessarily be &ldquo;of a justiciable nature, thus excluding an advisory decree upon a hypothetical state of facts.&rdquo; <em>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority</em>, 297 U.S. 288, 325, 56 S.Ct. 466, 473, 80 L.Ed. 688, 699 (1936). The existence or nonexistence of any right, duty, power, liability, privilege, disability, or immunity or of any fact upon which such legal relations depend, or of a status, may be declared. The petitioner must have a practical interest in the declaration sought and all parties having an interest therein or adversely affected must be made parties or be cited. A declaration may not be rendered if a special statutory proceeding has been provided for the adjudication of some special type of case, but general ordinary or extraordinary legal remedies, whether regulated by statute or not, are not deemed special statutory proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">When declaratory relief will not be effective in settling the controversy, the court may decline to grant it. But the fact that another remedy would be equally effective affords no ground for declining declaratory relief. The demand for relief shall state with precision the declaratory judgment desired, to which may be joined a demand for coercive relief, cumulatively or in the alternative; but when coercive relief only is sought but is deemed ungrantable or inappropriate, the court may <em>sua sponte</em>, if it serves a useful purpose, grant instead a declaration of rights. <em>Hasselbring v. Koepke</em>, 263 Mich. 466, 248 N.W. 869, 93 A.L.R. 1170 (1933). Written instruments, including ordinances and statutes, may be construed before or after breach at the petition of a properly interested party, process being served on the private parties or public officials interested. In other respects the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act affords a guide to the scope and function of the Federal act. Compare <em>Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Haworth</em>, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461 (1937); <em>Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Wallace</em>, 288 U.S. 249 (1933); <em>Gully, Tax Collector v. Interstate Natural Gas Co</em>., 82 F.(2d) 145 (C.C.A.5th, 1936); <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. v. Plummer</em>, 13 F.Supp. 169 (S.D.Tex., 1935); Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (1934), <em>passim.</em></p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Separate Document.</cap-smallcap> Every judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document, but a separate document is not required for an order disposing of a motion:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for judgment under Rule 50(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 52(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for attorney's fees under Rule 54;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for a new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment, under Rule 59; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) for relief under Rule 60.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Entering Judgment.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Without the Court's Direction.</em> Subject to Rule 54(b) and unless the court orders otherwise, the clerk must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment when:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the jury returns a general verdict;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the court awards only costs or a sum certain; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the court denies all relief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Court's Approval Required.</em> Subject to Rule 54(b), the court must promptly approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the jury returns a special verdict or a general verdict with answers to written questions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the court grants other relief not described in this subdivision (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Time of Entry.</cap-smallcap> For purposes of these rules, judgment is entered at the following times:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if a separate document is not required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a separate document is required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a) and the earlier of these events occurs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is set out in a separate document; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 150 days have run from the entry in the civil docket.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Request for Entry.</cap-smallcap> A party may request that judgment be set out in a separate document as required by Rule 58(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Cost or Fee Awards.</cap-smallcap> Ordinarily, the entry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. But if a timely motion for attorney's <!-- PDFPage:263 -->fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) as a timely motion under Rule 59.</p>

Compare 1 Idaho Code Ann. (1932) &sect;7&ndash;1101, and 4 Mont.Rev.Codes Ann.

(Remington, 1932) &sect;431, in jury cases the judgment is entered two days after the return of verdict to give time for making motion for new trial; &sect;435 (<em>ibid</em>.), provides that all judgments shall be entered by the clerk, subject to the court's direction.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The reference to Rule 54(b) is made necessary by the amendment of that rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two changes have been made in Rule 58 in order to clarify the practice. The substitution of the more inclusive phrase &ldquo;all relief be denied&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;there be no recovery&rdquo;, makes it clear that the clerk shall enter the judgment forthwith in the situations specified without awaiting the filing of a formal judgment approved by the court. The phrase &ldquo;all relief be denied&rdquo; covers cases such as the denial of a bankrupt's discharge and similar situations where the relief sought is refused but there is literally no denial of a &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The addition of the last sentence in the rule emphasizes that judgments are to be entered promptly by the clerk without waiting for the taxing of costs. Certain district court rules, for example, Civil Rule 22 of the Southern District of New York&mdash;until its annulment Oct. 1, 1945, for conflict with this rule&mdash;and the like rule of the Eastern District of New York, are expressly in conflict with this provision, although the federal law is of long standing and well settled. <em>Fowler v. Hamill</em> (1891) 139 U.S. 549; <em>Craig v. The Hartford</em> (C.C.Cal. 1856) Fed.Case No. 3,333; <em>Tuttle v. Claflin</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1895) 60 Fed. 7, cert. den. (1897) 166 U.S. 721; <em>Prescott & A. C. Ry. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1897) 84 Fed. 213; <em>Stallo v. Wagner</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1917) 245 Fed. 636, 639&ndash;40; <em>Brown v. Parker</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1899) 97 Fed. 446; <em>Allis-Chalmers v. United States</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1908) 162 Fed. 679. And this applies even though state law is to the contrary. <em>United States v. Nordbye</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1935) 75 F.(2d) 744, 746, cert. den. (1935) 296 U.S. 572. Inasmuch as it has been held that failure of the clerk thus enter judgment is a &ldquo;misprision&rdquo; &ldquo;not to be excused&rdquo; <em>(The Washington</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1926) 16 F.(2d) 206), such a district court rule may have serious consequences for a district court clerk. Rules of this sort also provide for delay in entry of the judgment contrary to Rule 58. See <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bedford's Estate</em> (1945) 325 U.S. 283.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the present rule a distinction has sometimes been made between judgments on general jury verdicts, on the one hand, and, on the other, judgments upon decisions of the court that a party shall recover only money or costs or that all relief shall be denied. In the first situation, it is clear that the clerk should enter the judgment without awaiting a direction by the court unless the court otherwise orders. In the second situation it was intended that the clerk should similarly enter the judgment forthwith upon the court's decision; but because of the separate listing in the rule, and the use of the phrase &ldquo;upon receipt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the direction,&rdquo; the rule has sometimes been interpreted as requiring the clerk to await a separate direction of the court. All these judgments are usually uncomplicated, and should be handled in the same way. The amended rule accordingly deals with them as a single group in clause (1) (substituting the expression &ldquo;only a sum certain&rdquo; for the present expression &ldquo;only money&rdquo;), and requires the clerk to prepare, sign, and enter them forthwith, without awaiting court direction, unless the court makes a contrary order. (The clerk's duty is ministerial and may be performed by a deputy clerk in the name of the clerk. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;956; <em>cf. Gilbertson v. United States</em>, 168 Fed. 672 (7th Cir. 1909).) The more complicated judgments described in clause (2) must be approved by the court before they are entered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58 is designed to encourage all reasonable speed in formulating and entering the judgment when the case has been decided. Participation by the attorneys through the submission of forms of judgment involves needless expenditure of time and effort and promotes delay, except in special cases where counsel's assistance can be of real value. See <em>Matteson v. United States</em>, 240 F.2d 517, 518&ndash;19 (2d Cir. 1956). Accordingly, the amended rule provides that attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment unless directed to do so by the court. This applies to the judgments mentioned in clause (2) as well as clause (1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Hitherto some difficulty has arisen, chiefly where the court has written an opinion or memorandum containing some apparently directive or dispositive words, e.g., &ldquo;the plaintiff's motion [for summary judgment] is granted,&rdquo; see <em>United States v. F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co</em>., 356 U.S. 227, 229, 78 S.Ct. 674, 2 L.Ed.2d 721 (1958). Clerks on occasion have viewed these opinions or memoranda as being in themselves a sufficient basis for entering judgment in the civil docket as provided by Rule 79(a). However, where the opinion or memorandum has not contained all the elements of a judgment, or where the judge has later signed a formal judgment, it has become a matter of doubt whether the purported entry of judgment was effective, starting the time running for postverdict motions and for the purpose of appeal. See <em>id.;</em> and <em>compare Blanchard v. Commonwealth Oil Co</em>., 294 F.2d 834 (5th Cir. 1961); <em>United States v. Higginson</em>, 238 F.2d 439 (1st Cir. 1956); <em>Danzig v. Virgin Isle Hotel, Inc</em>., 278 F.2d 580 (3d Cir. 1960); <em>Sears v. Austin</em>, 282 F.2d 340 (9th Cir. 1960), with <em>Matteson v. United States, supra; Erstling v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co</em>., 255 F.2d 93 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Barta v. Oglala Sioux Tribe</em>, 259 F.2d 553 (8th Cir. 1958), <em>cert. denied</em>, 358 U.S. 932, 79 S.Ct. 320, 3 L.Ed.2d 304 (1959); <em>Beacon Fed. S. & L. Assn. v. Federal Home L. Bank Bd</em>., 266 F.2d 246 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 823, 80 S.Ct. 70, 4 L.Ed.2d 67 (1959); <em>Ram v. Paramount Film D. Corp</em>., 278 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule eliminates these uncertainties by requiring that there be a judgment set out on a separate document&mdash;distinct from any opinion or memorandum&mdash;which provides the basis for the entry of judgment. That judgments shall be on separate documents is also indicated in Rule 79(b); and see General Rule 10 of the U.S. District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York; <em>Ram v. Paramount Film D. Corp., supra</em>, at 194.</p>
<p class="note-body">See the amendment of Rule 79(a) and the new specimen forms of judgment, Forms 31 and 32.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also Rule 55(b)(1) and (2) covering the subject of judgments by default.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ordinarily the pendency or post-judgment filing of a claim for attorney's fees will not affect the time for ap<!-- PDFPage:264 -->peal from the underlying judgment. <em>See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co</em>., 486 U.S. 196 (1988). Particularly if the claim for fees involves substantial issues or is likely to be affected by the appellate decision, the district court may prefer to defer consideration of the claim for fees until after the appeal is resolved. However, in many cases it may be more efficient to decide fee questions before an appeal is taken so that appeals relating to the fee award can be heard at the same time as appeals relating to the merits of the case. This revision permits, but does not require, the court to delay the finality of the judgment for appellate purposes under revised Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) until the fee dispute is decided. To accomplish this result requires entry of an order by the district court before the time a notice of appeal becomes effective for appellate purposes. If the order is entered, the motion for attorney's fees is treated in the same manner as a timely motion under Rule 59.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58 has provided that a judgment is effective only when set forth on a separate document and entered as provided in Rule 79(a). This simple separate document requirement has been ignored in many cases. The result of failure to enter judgment on a separate document is that the time for making motions under Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, and some motions under Rule 60, never begins to run. The time to appeal under Appellate Rule 4(a) also does not begin to run. There have been few visible problems with respect to Rule 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, or 60 motions, but there have been many and horridly confused problems under Appellate Rule 4(a). These amendments are designed to work in conjunction with Appellate Rule 4(a) to ensure that appeal time does not linger on indefinitely, and to maintain the integration of the time periods set for Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, and 60 with Appellate Rule 4(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58(a) preserves the core of the present separate document requirement, both for the initial judgment and for any amended judgment. No attempt is made to sort through the confusion that some courts have found in addressing the elements of a separate document. It is easy to prepare a separate document that recites the terms of the judgment without offering additional explanation or citation of authority. Forms 31 and 32 provide examples.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58 is amended, however, to address a problem that arises under Appellate Rule 4(a). Some courts treat such orders as those that deny a motion for new trial as a &ldquo;judgment,&rdquo; so that appeal time does not start to run until the order is entered on a separate document. Without attempting to address the question whether such orders are appealable, and thus judgments as defined by Rule 54(a), the amendment provides that entry on a separate document is not required for an order disposing of the motions listed in Appellate Rule 4(a). The enumeration of motions drawn from the Appellate Rule 4(a) list is generalized by omitting details that are important for appeal time purposes but that would unnecessarily complicate the separate document requirement. As one example, it is not required that any of the enumerated motions be timely. Many of the enumerated motions are frequently made before judgment is entered. The exemption of the order disposing of the motion does not excuse the obligation to set forth the judgment itself on a separate document. And if disposition of the motion results in an amended judgment, the amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58(b) discards the attempt to define the time when a judgment becomes &ldquo;effective.&rdquo; Taken in conjunction with the Rule 54(a) definition of a judgment to include &ldquo;any order from which an appeal lies,&rdquo; the former Rule 58 definition of effectiveness could cause strange difficulties in implementing pretrial orders that are appealable under interlocutory appeal provisions or under expansive theories of finality. Rule 58(b) replaces the definition of effectiveness with a new provision that defines the time when judgment is entered. If judgment is promptly set forth on a separate document, as should be done when required by Rule 58(a)(1), the new provision will not change the effect of Rule 58. But in the cases in which court and clerk fail to comply with this simple requirement, the motion time periods set by Rules 50, 52, 54, 59, and 60 begin to run after expiration of 150 days from entry of the judgment in the civil docket as required by Rule 79(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">A companion amendment of Appellate Rule 4(a)(7) integrates these changes with the time to appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new all-purpose definition of the entry of judgment must be applied with common sense to other questions that may turn on the time when judgment is entered. If the 150-day provision in Rule 58(b)(2)(B)&mdash;designed to integrate the time for post-judgment motions with appeal time&mdash;serves no purpose, or would defeat the purpose of another rule, it should be disregarded. In theory, for example, the separate document requirement continues to apply to an interlocutory order that is appealable as a final decision under collateral-order doctrine. Appealability under collateral-order doctrine should not be complicated by failure to enter the order as a judgment on a separate document&mdash;there is little reason to force trial judges to speculate about the potential appealability of every order, and there is no means to ensure that the trial judge will always reach the same conclusion as the court of appeals. Appeal time should start to run when the collateral order is entered without regard to creation of a separate document and without awaiting expiration of the 150 days provided by Rule 58(b)(2). Drastic surgery on Rules 54(a) and 58 would be required to address this and related issues, however, and it is better to leave this conundrum to the pragmatic disregard that seems its present fate. The present amendments do not seem to make matters worse, apart from one false appearance. If a pretrial order is set forth on a separate document that meets the requirements of Rule 58(b), the time to move for reconsideration seems to begin to run, perhaps years before final judgment. And even if there is no separate document, the time to move for reconsideration seems to begin 150 days after entry in the civil docket. This apparent problem is resolved by Rule 54(b), which expressly permits revision of all orders not made final under Rule 54(b) &ldquo;at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 58(d) replaces the provision that attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment except on direction of the court. This provision was added to Rule 58 to avoid the delays that were frequently encountered by the former practice of directing the attorneys for the prevailing party to prepare a form of judgment, and also to avoid the occasionally inept drafting that resulted from attorney-prepared judgments. See <em>11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 2d, &sect;2786</em>. The express direction in Rule 58(a)(2) for prompt action by the clerk, and by the court if court action is required, addresses this concern. The new provision allowing any party to move for entry of judgment on a separate document will protect all needs for prompt commencement of the periods for motions, appeals, and execution or other enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> Minor style changes were made. The definition of the time of entering judgment in Rule 58(b) was extended to reach all Civil Rules, not only the Rules described in the published version&mdash;Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, 60, and 62. And the time of entry was extended from 60 days to 150 days after entry in the civil docket without a required separate document.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Grounds for New Trial.</em> The court may, on motion, grant a new trial on all or some of the issues&mdash;and to any party&mdash;as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) after a jury trial, for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after a nonjury trial, for any reason for which a rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in federal court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Further Action After a Nonjury Trial.</em> After a nonjury trial, the court may, on motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and direct the entry of a new judgment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Time to File a Motion for a New Trial.</cap-smallcap> A motion for a new trial must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Time to Serve Affidavits.</cap-smallcap> When a motion for a new trial is based on affidavits, they must be filed with the motion. The opposing party has 14 days after being served to file opposing affidavits. The court may permit reply affidavits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>New Trial on the Court's Initiative or for Reasons Not in the Motion.</cap-smallcap> No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court, on its own, may order a new trial for any reason that would justify granting one on a party's motion. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion. In either event, the court must specify the reasons in its order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment.</cap-smallcap> A motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule represents an amalgamation of the petition for rehearing of [former] Equity Rule 69 (Petition for Rehearing) and the motion for new trial of U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;391 [see 2111] (New trials; harmless error), made in the light of the experience and provision of the code States. Compare Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;&sect;656&ndash;663a, U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;391 [see 2111] (New trials; harmless error) is thus substantially continued in this rule. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;840 (Executions; stay on conditions) is modified insofar as it contains time provisions inconsistent with <em>Subdivision (b)</em>. For the effect of the motion for new trial upon the time for taking an appeal see <em>Morse v. United States</em>, 270 U.S. 151 (1926); <em>Aspen Mining and Smelting Co. v. Billings</em>, 150 U.S. 31 (1893).</p>

Champlin Refining Co</em>., 283 U.S. 494 (1931); <em>Schuerholz v. Roach</em>, 58 F.(2d) 32 (C.C.A.4th, 1932); <em>Simmons v.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. With the time for appeal to a circuit court of appeals reduced in general to 30 days by the proposed amendment of Rule 73(a), the utility of the original &ldquo;except&rdquo; clause, which permits a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence to be made before the expiration of the time for appeal, would have been seriously restricted. It was thought advisable, therefore, to take care of this matter in another way. By amendment of Rule 60(b), newly discovered evidence is made the basis for relief from a judgment, and the maximum time limit has been extended to one year. Accordingly the amendment of Rule 59(b) eliminates the &ldquo;except&rdquo; clause and its specific treatment of newly discovered evidence as a ground for a motion for new trial. This ground remains, however, as a basis for a motion for new trial served not later than 10 days after the entry of judgment. See also Rule 60(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">As to the effect of a motion under subdivision (b) upon the running of appeal time, see amended Rule 73(a) and Note.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. This subdivision has been added to care for a situation such as that arising in <em>Boaz v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1944) 146 F.(2d) 321, and makes clear that the district court possesses the power asserted in that case to alter or amend a judgment after its entry. The subdivision deals only with alteration or amendment of the original judgment in a case and does not relate to a judgment upon motion as provided in Rule 50(b). As to the effect of a motion under subdivision (e) upon the running of appeal time, see amended Rule 73(a) and Note.</p>
<p class="note-body">The title of Rule 59 has been expanded to indicate the inclusion of this subdivision.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">By narrow interpretation of Rule 59(b) and (d), it has been held that the trial court is without power to grant a motion for a new trial, timely served, by an order made more than 10 days after the entry of judgment, based upon a ground not stated in the motion but perceived and relied on by the trial court sua sponte. <em>Freid v. McGrath</em>, 133 F.2d 350 (D.C.Cir. 1942); <em>National Farmers Union Auto. & Cas. Co. v. Wood</em>, 207 F.2d 659 (10th Cir. 1953); <em>Bailey v. Slentz</em>, 189 F.2d 406 (10th Cir. 1951); <em>Marshall's U.S. Auto Supply, Inc. v. Cashman</em>, 111 F.2d 140 (10th Cir. 1940), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 667 (1940); but see <em>Steinberg v. Indemnity Ins. Co</em>., 36 F.R.D. 253 (E.D.La. 1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">The result is undesirable. Just as the court has power under Rule 59(d) to grant a new trial of its own initiative within the 10 days, so it should have power, when an effective new trial motion has been made and is pending, to decide it on grounds thought meritorious by the court although not advanced in the motion. The second sentence added by amendment to Rule 59(d) confirms the court's power in the latter situation, with provision that the parties be afforded a hearing before the power is exercised. See 6 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, par. 59.09[2] (2d ed. 1953).</p>
<p class="note-body">In considering whether a given ground has or has not been advanced in the motion made by the party, it should be borne in mind that the particularity called for in stating the grounds for a new trial motion is the <!-- PDFPage:266 -->same as that required for all motions by Rule 7(b)(1). The latter rule does not require ritualistic detail but rather a fair indication to court and counsel of the substance of the grounds relied on. See <em>Lebeck v. William A. Jarvis Co</em>., 250 F.2d 285 (3d Cir. 1957); <em>Tsai v. Rosenthal</em>, 297 F.2d 614 (8th Cir. 1961); <em>General Motors Corp. v. Perry</em>, 303 F.2d 544 (7th Cir. 1962); <em>cf. Grimm v. California Spray-Chemical Corp</em>., 264 F.2d 145 (9th Cir. 1959); <em>Cooper v. Midwest Feed Products Co</em>., 271 F.2d 177 (8th Cir. 1959).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The only change, other than stylistic, intended by this revision is to add explicit time limits for filing motions for a new trial, motions to alter or amend a judgment, and affidavits opposing a new trial motion. Previously, there was an inconsistency in the wording of Rules 50, 52, and 59 with respect to whether certain post-judgment motions had to be filed, or merely served, during the prescribed period. This inconsistency caused special problems when motions for a new trial were joined with other post-judgment motions. These motions affect the finality of the judgment, a matter often of importance to third persons as well as the parties and the court. The Committee believes that each of these rules should be revised to require filing before end of the 10-day period. Filing is an event that can be determined with certainty from court records. The phrase &ldquo;no later than&rdquo; is used&mdash;rather than &ldquo;within&rdquo;&mdash;to include post-judgment motions that sometimes are filed before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. It should be noted that under Rule 5 the motions when filed are to contain a certificate of service on other parties. It also should be noted that under Rule 6(a) Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in measuring the 10-day period, but that Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) excludes intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays only in computing periods less than 8 days.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 59 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Former Rules 50, 52, and 59 adopted 10-day periods for their respective post-judgment motions. Rule 6(b) prohibits any expansion of those periods. Experience has proved that in many cases it is not possible to prepare a satisfactory post-judgment motion in 10 days, even under the former rule that excluded intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. These time periods are particularly sensitive because Appellate Rule 4 integrates the time to appeal with a timely motion under these rules. Rather than introduce the prospect of uncertainty in appeal time by amending Rule 6(b) to permit additional time, the former 10-day periods are expanded to 28 days. Rule 6(b) continues to prohibit expansion of the 28-day period.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 59(c) set a 10-day period after being served with a motion for new trial to file opposing affidavits. It also provided that the period could be extended for up to 20 days for good cause or by stipulation. The apparent 20-day limit on extending the time to file opposing affidavits seemed to conflict with the Rule 6(b) authority to extend time without any specific limit. This tension between the two rules may have been inadvertent. It is resolved by deleting the former Rule 59(c) limit. Rule 6(b) governs. The underlying 10-day period was extended to 14 days to reflect the change in the Rule 6(a) method for computing periods of less than 11 days.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made after Publication and Comment.</em> The 30-day period proposed in the August 2007 publication is shortened to 28 days.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Corrections Based on Clerical Mistakes; Oversights and Omissions.</cap-smallcap> The court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. The court may do so on motion or on its own, with or without notice. But after an appeal has been docketed in the appellate court and while it is pending, such a mistake may be corrected only with the appellate court's leave.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Grounds for Relief from a Final Judgment, Order, or Proceeding.</cap-smallcap> On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the judgment is void;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) any other reason that justifies relief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Timing and Effect of the Motion.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Timing.</em> A motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time&mdash;and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Effect on Finality.</em> The motion does not affect the judgment's finality or suspend its operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Other Powers to Grant Relief.</cap-smallcap> This rule does not limit a court's power to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) grant relief under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1655 to a defendant who was not personally notified of the action; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Bills and Writs Abolished.</cap-smallcap> The following are abolished: bills of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, and audita querela.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment incorporates the view expressed in <em>Perlman v. 322 West Seventy-Second Street Co., Inc</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 127 F.(2d) 716; 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 3276, and further permits correction after docketing, with leave of the appellate court. Some courts have thought that upon the taking of an appeal the district court lost its power to act. See <em>Schram v. Safety Investment Co</em>. (E.D.Mich. 1942) 45 F.Supp. 636; also <em>Miller v. United States</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1940) 114 F.(2d) 267.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. When promulgated, the rules contained a number of provisions, including those found in Rule 60(b), describing the practice by a motion to obtain relief from judgments, and these rules, coupled with the reservation in Rule 60(b) of the right to entertain a new action to relieve a party from a judgment, were generally supposed to cover the field. Since the rules have been in force, decisions have been rendered that the use of bills of review, <em>coram nobis</em>, or <em>audita querela</em>, to obtain relief from final judgments is still proper, and that various remedies of this kind still exist although they are not mentioned in the rules and the practice is not prescribed in the rules. It is obvious that the rules should be complete in this respect and define the practice with respect to any existing rights or remedies to obtain relief from final judgments. For extended discussion of the old common law writs and equitable remedies, the interpretation of Rule 60, and proposals for change, see Moore and Rogers, <em>Federal Relief from Civil Judgments</em> (1946) 55 Yale L.J. 623. See also 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 3254 <em>et seq</em>.; Commentary, <em>Effect of Rule 60b on Other Methods of Relief From Judgment</em> (1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 942, 945; <em>Wallace v. United States</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 142 F.(2d) 240, cert. den. (1944) 323 U.S. 712.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reconstruction of Rule 60(b) has for one of its purposes a clarification of this situation. Two types of procedure to obtain relief from judgments are specified in the rules as it is proposed to amend them. One procedure is by motion in the court and in the action in which the judgment was rendered. The other procedure is by a new or independent action to obtain relief from a judgment, which action may or may not be begun in the court which rendered the judgment. Various rules, such as the one dealing with a motion for new trial and for amendment of judgments, Rule 59, one for amended findings, Rule 52, and one for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Rule 50(b), and including the provisions of Rule 60(b) as amended, prescribe the various types of cases in which the practice by motion is permitted. In each case there is a limit upon the time within which resort to a motion is permitted, and this time limit may not be enlarged under Rule 6(b). If the right to make a motion is lost by the expiration of the time limits fixed in these rules, the only other procedural remedy is by a new or independent action to set aside a judgment upon those principles which have heretofore been applied in such an action. Where the independent action is resorted to, the limitations of time are those of laches or statutes of limitations. The Committee has endeavored to ascertain all the remedies and types of relief heretofore available by <em>coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela</em>, bill of review, or bill in the nature of a bill of review. See Moore and Rogers, <em>Federal Relief from Civil Judgments</em> (1946) 55 Yale L.J. 623, 659&ndash;682. It endeavored then to amend the rules to permit, either by motion or by independent action, the granting of various kinds of relief from judgments which were permitted in the federal courts prior to the adoption of these rules, and the amendment concludes with a provision abolishing the use of bills of review and the other common law writs referred to, and requiring the practice to be by motion or by independent action.</p>
<p class="note-body">To illustrate the operation of the amendment, it will be noted that under Rule 59(b) as it now stands, without amendment, a motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence is permitted within ten days after the entry of the judgment, or after that time upon leave of the court. It is proposed to amend Rule 59(b) by providing that under that rule a motion for new trial shall be served not later than ten days after the entry of the judgment, whatever the ground be for the motion, whether error by the court or newly discovered evidence. On the other hand, one of the purposes of the bill of review in equity was to afford relief on the ground of newly discovered evidence long after the entry of the judgment. Therefore, to permit relief by a motion similar to that heretofore obtained on bill of review, Rule 60(b) as amended permits an application for relief to be made by motion, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, within one year after judgment. Such a motion under Rule 60(b) does not affect the finality of the judgment, but a motion under Rule 59, made within 10 days, does affect finality and the running of the time for appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">If these various amendments, including principally those to Rule 60(b), accomplish the purpose for which they are intended, the federal rules will deal with the practice in every sort of case in which relief from final judgments is asked, and prescribe the practice. With reference to the question whether, as the rules now exist, relief by <em>coram nobis</em>, bills of review, and so forth, is permissible, the generally accepted view is that the remedies are still available, although the precise relief obtained in a particular case by use of these ancillary remedies is shrouded in ancient lore and mystery. See <em>Wallace v. United States</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 142 F.(2d) 240, cert. den. (1944) 323 U.S. 712; <em>Fraser v. Doing</em> (App.D.C. 1942) 130 F.(2d) 617; <em>Jones v. Watts</em> (C.C.A.5th, 1944) 142 F.(2d) 575; <em>Preveden v. Hahn</em> (S.D.N.Y. 1941) 36 F.Supp. 952; <em>Cavallo v. Agwilines, Inc</em>.

Versluis v. Oliver</em> (W.D.Okla. 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 60b.31, Case 3; Moore and Rogers, <em>Federal Relief from Civil Judgments</em> (1946) 55 Yale L.J. 623, 631&ndash;653; 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 3254 <em>et seq</em>.; Commentary, <em>Effect of Rule 60b on Other Methods of Relief From Judgment, op. cit. supra.

Berens</em> (D.D.C. 1945) 8 Fed.Rules Serv. 60b.51, Case 1, 73 W.L.R. 209.</p>
<p class="note-body">The transposition of the words &ldquo;the court&rdquo; and the addition of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; at the beginning of the first sentence are merely verbal changes. The addition of the qualifying word &ldquo;final&rdquo; emphasizes the character of the judgments, orders or proceedings from which Rule 60(b) affords relief; and hence interlocutory judgments are not brought within the restrictions of the rule, but rather they are left subject to the complete power of the court rendering them to afford such relief from them as justice requires.</p>
<p class="note-body">The qualifying pronoun &ldquo;his&rdquo; has been eliminated on the basis that it is too restrictive, and that the subdivision should include the mistake or neglect of others which may be just as material and call just as much for supervisory jurisdiction as where the judgment is taken against the party through <em>his</em> mistake, inadvertence, etc.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fraud, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party are express grounds for relief by motion under amended subdivision (b). There is no sound reason for their exclusion. The incorporation of fraud and the like within the scope of the rule also removes confusion as to the proper procedure. It has been held that relief from a judgment obtained by extrinsic fraud could be secured by <!-- PDFPage:268 -->motion within a &ldquo;reasonable time,&rdquo; which might be after the time stated in the rule had run. <em>Fiske v. Buder</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1942) 125 F.(2d) 841; see also inferentially <em>Bucy v. Nevada Construction Co</em>. (C.C.A.9th, 1942) 125 F.(2d) 213. On the other hand, it has been suggested that in view of the fact that fraud was omitted from original Rule 60(b) as a ground for relief, an independent action was the only proper remedy. Commentary, <em>Effect of Rule 60b on Other Methods of Relief From Judgment</em> (1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 942, 945. The amendment settles this problem by making fraud an express ground for relief by motion; and under the saving clause, fraud may be urged as a basis for relief by independent action insofar as established doctrine permits. See Moore and Rogers, <em>Federal Relief from Civil Judgments</em> (1946) 55 Yale L.J. 623, 653&ndash;659; 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 3267 <em>et seq</em>. And the rule expressly does not limit the power of the court, when fraud has been perpetrated upon it, to give relief under the saving clause. As an illustration of this situation, see <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford Empire Co</em>. (1944) 322 U.S. 238.</p>
<p class="note-body">The time limit for relief by motion in the court and in the action in which the judgment was rendered has been enlarged from six months to one year.</p>
<p class="note-body">It should be noted that Rule 60(b) does not assume to define the substantive law as to the grounds for vacating judgments, but merely prescribes the practice in proceedings to obtain relief.</p>
<p class="note-body">It should also be noted that under &sect;200(4) of the Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. [App.] &sect;501 <em>et seq</em>. [&sect;520(4)]), a judgment rendered in any action or proceeding governed by the section may be vacated under certain specified circumstances upon proper application to the court.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Automatic Stay; Exceptions for Injunctions, Receiverships, and Patent Accountings.</cap-smallcap> Except as stated in this rule, no execution may issue on a judgment, nor may proceedings be taken to enforce it, until 14 days have passed after its entry. But unless the court orders otherwise, the following are not stayed after being entered, even if an appeal is taken:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction or a receivership; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a judgment or order that directs an accounting in an action for patent infringement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Stay Pending the Disposition of a Motion.</cap-smallcap> On appropriate terms for the opposing party's security, the court may stay the execution of a judgment&mdash;or any proceedings to enforce it&mdash;pending disposition of any of the following motions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under Rule 50, for judgment as a matter of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) under Rule 52(b), to amend the findings or for additional findings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) under Rule 59, for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) under Rule 60, for relief from a judgment or order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Injunction Pending an Appeal.</cap-smallcap> While an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, dissolves, or denies an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party's rights. If the judgment appealed from is rendered by a statutory three-judge district court, the order must be made either:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by that court sitting in open session; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by the assent of all its judges, as evidenced by their signatures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Stay with Bond on Appeal.</cap-smallcap> If an appeal is taken, the appellant may obtain a stay by supersedeas bond, except in an action described in Rule 62(a)(1) or (2). The bond may be given upon or after filing the notice of appeal or after obtaining the order allowing the appeal. The stay takes effect when the court approves the bond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Stay Without Bond on an Appeal by the United States, Its Officers, or Its Agencies.</cap-smallcap> The court must not require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appellant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed by a department of the federal government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Stay in Favor of a Judgment Debtor Under State Law.</cap-smallcap> If a judgment is a lien on the <!-- PDFPage:269 -->judgment debtor's property under the law of the state where the court is located, the judgment debtor is entitled to the same stay of execution the state court would give.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Appellate Court's Power Not Limited.</cap-smallcap> This rule does not limit the power of the appellate court or one of its judges or justices:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to stay proceedings&mdash;or suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction&mdash;while an appeal is pending; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to issue an order to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment to be entered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Stay with Multiple Claims or Parties.</cap-smallcap> A court may stay the enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 54(b) until it enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed judgment for the party in whose favor it was entered.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009</h4>
<p class="note-body">This new rule adopts for any motion that the district court cannot grant because of a pending appeal the practice that most courts follow when a party makes a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate a judgment that is pending on appeal. After an appeal has been docketed and while it remains pending, the district court cannot grant a Rule 60(b) motion without a remand. But it can entertain the motion and deny it, defer consideration, or state that it would grant the motion if the the [sic] court of appeals remands for that purpose or state that the motion raises a substantial issue. Experienced lawyers often refer to the suggestion for remand as an &ldquo;indicative ruling.&rdquo; (Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) lists six motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or after the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed of. The district court has authority to grant the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.)</p>
<p class="note-body">This clear procedure is helpful whenever relief is sought from an order that the court cannot reconsider because the order is the subject of a pending appeal. Rule 62.1 does not attempt to define the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats the district court's authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. The rules that govern the relationship between trial courts and appellate courts may be complex, depending in part on the nature of the order and the source of appeal jurisdiction. Rule 62.1 applies only when those rules deprive the district court of authority to grant relief without appellate permission. If the district court concludes that it has authority to grant relief without appellate permission, it can act without falling back on the indicative ruling procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">To ensure proper coordination of proceedings in the district court and in the appellate court, the movant must notify the circuit clerk under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 12.1 if the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Remand is in the court of appeals&rsquo; discretion under Appellate Rule 12.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Often it will be wise for the district court to determine whether it in fact would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose. But a motion may present complex issues that require extensive litigation and that may either be mooted or be presented in a different context by decision of the issues raised on appeal. In such circumstances the district court may prefer to state that the motion raises a substantial issue, and to state the reasons why it prefers to decide only if the court of appeals agrees that it would be useful to decide the motion before decision of the pending appeal. The district court is not bound to grant the motion after stating that the motion raises a substantial issue; further proceedings on remand may show that the motion ought not be granted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment.</em> The rule text is changed by substituting &ldquo;for that purpose&rdquo; for &ldquo;further proceedings&rdquo;; the reason is discussed above.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes are made in the Committee Note to make it conform to the Committee Note for proposed Appellate Rule 12.1.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 63. Judge's Inability to Proceed</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">If a judge conducting a hearing or trial is unable to proceed, any other judge may proceed upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or a nonjury trial, the successor judge must, at a party's request, recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify again without undue burden. The successor judge may also recall any other witness.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule adapts and extends the provisions of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;776 (Bill of exceptions; authentication; signing of by judge) to include all duties to be performed by the judge after verdict or judgment. The statute is therefore superseded.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The revision substantially displaces the former rule. The former rule was limited to the disability of the judge, and made no provision for disqualification or possible other reasons for the withdrawal of the judge during proceedings. In making provision for other circumstances, the revision is not intended to encourage judges to discontinue participation in a trial for any but compelling reasons. Cf. <em>United States v. Lane</em>, 708 F.2d 1394, 1395&ndash;1397 (9th cir. 1983). Manifestly, a substitution should not be made for the personal convenience of the court, and the reasons for a substitution should be stated on the record.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former rule made no provision for the withdrawal of the judge during the trial, but was limited to disqualification after trial. Several courts concluded that the text of the former rule prohibited substitution of a new judge prior to the points described in the rule, thus requiring a new trial, whether or not a fair disposition was within reach of a substitute judge. <em>E.g., Whalen v. Ford Motor Credit Co</em>., 684 F.2d 272 (4th Cir. 1982, en banc) <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 910 (1982) (jury trial); <em>Arrow-Hart, Inc. v. Philip Carey Co</em>., 552 F.2d 711 (6th Cir. 1977) (non-jury trial). <em>See generally</em> Comment, <em>The Case of the Dead Judge: Fed.R.Civ.P. 63: Whalen v. Ford Motor Credit Co</em>., 67 MINN. L. REV. 827 (1983).</p>
<p class="note-body">The increasing length of federal trials has made it likely that the number of trials interrupted by the disability of the judge will increase. An efficient mechanism for completing these cases without unfairness is needed to prevent unnecessary expense and delay. To avoid the injustice that may result if the substitute judge proceeds despite unfamiliarity with the action, the new Rule provides, in language similar to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a), that the successor <!-- PDFPage:271 -->judge must certify familiarity with the record and determine that the case may be completed before that judge without prejudice to the parties. This will necessarily require that there be available a transcript or a videotape of the proceedings prior to substitution. If there has been a long but incomplete jury trial, the prompt availability of the transcript or videotape is crucial to the effective use of this rule, for the jury cannot long be held while an extensive transcript is prepared without prejudice to one or all parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised text authorizes the substitute judge to make a finding of fact at a bench trial based on evidence heard by a different judge. This may be appropriate in limited circumstances. First, if a witness has become unavailable, the testimony recorded at trial can be considered by the successor judge pursuant to F.R.Ev. 804, being equivalent to a recorded deposition available for use at trial pursuant to Rule 32. For this purpose, a witness who is no longer subject to a subpoena to compel testimony at trial is unavailable. Secondly, the successor judge may determine that particular testimony is not material or is not disputed, and so need not be reheard. The propriety of proceeding in this manner may be marginally affected by the availability of a videotape record; a judge who has reviewed a trial on videotape may be entitled to greater confidence in his or her ability to proceed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court would, however, risk error to determine the credibility of a witness not seen or heard who is available to be recalled. Cf. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City NC</em>, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985); <em>Marshall v. Jerrico Inc</em>, 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980). See also <em>United States v. Radatz</em>, 447 U.S. 667 (1980).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 63 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
