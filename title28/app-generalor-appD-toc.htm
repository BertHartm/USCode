<h3 class="analysis-subhead">PROCEDURE IN CONGRESSIONAL REFERENCE CASES</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>1. Purpose.</strong> The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 amended 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1492 and 2509 to authorize either house of Congress to refer bills to the chief judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims for investigation and report to the appropriate house. Procedures promulgated by the chief judge applicable to such congressional reference cases are specified herein. The RCFC, to the extent feasible, are to be applied in congressional reference cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>2. Service of Notice.</strong> Upon referral of a bill to the chief judge by either house of Congress, the clerk shall docket the reference and serve a notice, as provided in RCFC 5, on each person whose name and address is shown by the papers transmitted and who appears to have an interest in the subject matter of the reference. The notice shall set forth the filing of the reference and state that the person notified appears to have an interest therein and that such person shall have 90 days within which to file a complaint. The clerk shall forward a copy of each such notice to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3. Complaint.</strong> Any person served with notice who desires to assert a claim may do so by filing a complaint in accordance with RCFC 5.3(d), 8, and 9.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>4. Failure of a Party to Appear.</strong> If no interested person files a complaint within the time specified in the notice served by the clerk, the case may be reported upon the papers filed and upon such evidence, if any, as may be produced by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>5. Hearing Officer; Review Panel.</strong> Upon the filing of a complaint, the chief judge will designate by order a judge of the court to serve as the hearing officer and a panel of three judges to serve as the reviewing body. One of the review panel members will be designated by the chief judge as the presiding officer of the panel. Each hearing officer and each review panel, acting by majority vote, shall have authority to perform any acts which may be necessary or proper for the efficient performance of their duties, including the power of subpoena and the power to administer oaths and affirmations. Subpoenas requiring travel of more than 100 miles to the place of trial must have attached thereto an order of approval by the hearing officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>6. Hearing Officer Report.</strong> The hearing officer shall conduct such proceedings and utilize such Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims as may be required to determine the facts, including facts relating to delay or laches, facts bearing upon the question of whether the bar of any statute of limitation should be removed, or facts claimed to excuse the claimant for not having resorted to any established legal remedy. The hearing officer shall find the facts specially. The hearing officer shall append to the findings of fact conclusions sufficient to inform Congress whether the demand is a legal or equitable claim or a gratuity, and the amount, if any, legally or equitably due from the United States to the claimant. The report shall be filed with the clerk, and served by the clerk on the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>7. Acceptance or Exceptions.</strong> Within 30 days after service of the report, each party shall file either (a) a notice of intention to except to the report or (b) a notice accepting the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>8. Review Panel Consideration and Report.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> The clerk shall transmit the findings and conclusions of the hearing officer, together with the record of the case, to the review panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> If either party files a notice of intention to except, the presiding officer shall establish by order a schedule for the parties to file briefs on exceptions to the hearing officer's findings and conclusions and any requests for oral argument before the panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> If neither party files a notice of intention to except, the review panel shall nevertheless review the report. If the review panel is considering a material modification of the findings or conclusions of the hearing officer, the presiding officer by order shall so notify the parties and shall establish a schedule for the parties to file briefs and any requests for oral argument before the panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d)</strong> The hearing officer's findings shall not be set aside unless they are found to be clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the hearing officer to judge the credibility of witnesses. The hearing officer's conclusions shall not be set aside unless justice shall so require. No case shall be returned to the hearing officer unless so ordered by the review panel.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:472 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e)</strong> After conclusion of its review, including any briefing and argument, the review panel, by majority vote, shall adopt or modify the findings and conclusions of the hearing officer and file its report with the clerk for service on the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>9. Rehearing.</strong> Within 10 days after service of the report of the review panel, any party may file a motion for rehearing to alter or amend the report. The motion shall state with particularity any contention of law or fact which the movant believes has been overlooked or misapprehended, and shall contain arguments in support thereof. Oral argument in support of the motion shall not be permitted. No response to a motion for rehearing is required but will be considered if filed within 10 days after the date the motion for rehearing is served. No time extension shall be allowed for filing such a response. If the motion for rehearing is granted, the review panel shall take such further action as in its discretion may be required by the circumstances of the particular case. The chief judge will entertain no appeals or requests for review of any rulings or actions by a hearing officer or a review panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>10. Transmittal to Congress.</strong> When all proceedings are concluded, the report of the review panel shall be transmitted by the chief judge to the appropriate house of Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>11. Admission to Practice.</strong> Any attorney representing a claimant in a congressional reference case may file and appear as attorney of record in the proceeding if such attorney is a member of the bar of the United States Court of Federal Claims or, if not, upon certification to the clerk that such attorney is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any state in the Union or the District of Columbia. Any claimant, except a corporation, in a congressional reference case may proceed <em>pro se</em>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>12. Filing Fees.</strong> Filing fees set forth on the court's website at <em>http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov</em> are required in congressional reference cases.</p>
