<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Agency to File; Time for Filing; Notice of Filing.</cap-smallcap> The agency must file the record with the circuit clerk within 40 days after being served with a petition for review, unless the statute authorizing review provides otherwise, or within 40 days after it files an application for enforcement unless the respondent fails to answer or the court orders otherwise. The court may shorten or extend the time to file the record. The clerk must notify all parties of the date when the record is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Filing&mdash;What Constitutes.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The agency must file:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the original or a certified copy of the entire record or parts designated by the parties; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a certified list adequately describing all documents, transcripts of testimony, exhibits, and other material constituting the record, or describing those parts designated by the parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The parties may stipulate in writing that no record or certified list be filed. The date when the stipulation is filed with the circuit clerk is treated as the date when the record is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The agency must retain any portion of the record not filed with the clerk. All parts of the record retained by the agency are a part of the record on review for all purposes and, if the court or a party so requests, must be sent to the court regardless of any prior stipulation.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision is based upon section 7 of the uniform rule (see General Note following Rule 15). That rule does not prescribe a time for filing the record in enforcement cases. Forty days are allowed in order to avoid useless preparation of the record or certified list in cases where the application for enforcement is not contested.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This subdivision is based upon 28 U.S.C. &sect;2112 and section 7 of the uniform rule. It permits the agency to file either the record itself or a certified list of its contents. It also permits the parties to stipulate against transmission of designated parts of the record without the fear that an inadvertent stipulation may &ldquo;diminish&rdquo; the record. Finally, the parties may, in cases where consultation of the record is unnecessary, stipulate that neither the record nor a certified list of its contents be filed.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Ad<!-- PDFPage:32 -->visory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a substantive change is made, however, in subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> The current rule provides that when a court of appeals is asked to review or enforce an agency order, the agency must file either &ldquo;the entire record or such parts thereof as the parties may designate by stipulation filed with the agency&rdquo; or a certified list describing the documents, transcripts, exhibits, and other material constituting the record. If the agency is not filing a certified list, the current rule requires the agency to file the entire record unless the parties file a &ldquo;stipulation&rdquo; designating only parts of the record. Such a &ldquo;stipulation&rdquo; presumably requires agreement of the parties as to the parts to be filed. The amended language in subparagraph (b)(1)(A) permits the agency to file the entire record or &ldquo;parts designated by the parties.&rdquo; The new language permits the filing of less than the entire record even when the parties do not agree as to which parts should be filed. Each party can designate the parts that it wants filed; the agency can then forward the parts designated by each party. In contrast, paragraph (b)(2) continues to require stipulation, that is agreement of the parties, that the agency need not file either the record or a certified list.</p>
