<h3 class="section-head">Rule 7. Pleadings Allowed; Consultation; Oral Argument; Response Time; Show Cause Order; Form of Motions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Pleadings. There shall be a complaint and, except for an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c), an answer; a reply to a counterclaim denominated as such; an answer to a cross-claim, if the answer contains a cross-claim; a third-party complaint, if a person who was not an original party is summoned under the provisions of Rule 14; and a third-party answer, if a third-party complaint is served. No other pleading shall be allowed, except that the court may order a reply to an answer or a third-party answer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Motions; Consultation. Before a motion for an extension of time as prescribed in Rule 6(b), a motion for intervention as prescribed in Rule 24(a), a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the liquidation of entries, a motion for a hearing as prescribed in Rule 56.2(e), a motion for the designation of a test case or suspension as prescribed in Rule 84, or a motion for an order compelling disclosure or discovery as prescribed in Rule 37(a), is made, the moving party shall consult with all other parties to the action to attempt to reach agreement, in good faith, on the issues involved in the motion. If the court finds that a party willfully refused to consult, or, having consulted, willfully refused to attempt to reach agreement in good faith, the court may impose such sanctions as it deems proper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Oral Argument. Upon motion of a party, or upon its own initiative, the court may direct oral argument on a motion at a time and place designated as prescribed in Rule 77(c). A motion for oral argument on a motion shall be filed no later than 20 days after service of the response to the motion, or 20 days after the expiration of the period of time allowed for service of a response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Time To Respond. Unless otherwise prescribed by these rules, or by order of the court, a response to a motion shall be served within 10 days after service of such motion, except that a response to a dispositive motion shall be served within 30 days after service of such motion. The moving party shall have 10 days after service of the response to a dispositive motion to serve a reply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Order To Show Cause. No order to show cause to bring on a motion shall be granted except upon a clear and specific showing by affidavit of good and specific reasons why procedure other than regular motion is necessary or why the time to respond should be shortened.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Form of Motions and Other Papers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An application to the court for an order shall be by motion, properly designated, which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall be in writing and shall state, with particularity, the grounds therefor. Motions which require consultation between counsel before being made as prescribed by subdivision (b) of this rule shall describe the reasonable effort made to reach agreement on the issues involved in the motion through consultation with opposing counsel, without the intervention of the court, and shall <!-- PDFPage:517 -->also recite the date and time of such consultation, as well as the names of all persons participating. All motions shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be accompanied by a proposed order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The rules applicable to the captions, signing, and other matters of form of pleadings apply to all motions and other papers prescribed by these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) All motions shall be signed in accordance with Rule 11.</p>

<!-- field-start:head -->
<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Claims for Relief. A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) New Grounds. A party who wishes the court to consider any new ground in support of a civil action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(a) shall aver the new ground in accordance with this rule and, as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2638, shall also aver that the new ground: (1) applies to the same merchandise that was the subject of the protest; and (2) is related to the same administrative decision that was contested in the protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Defenses; Form of Denials. A party shall state in short and plain terms the party's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If a party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the party shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, the pleader shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, the pleader may make denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs, or may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the pleader expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all its averments, including averments of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, the pleader may do so by general denial subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Affirmative Defenses. In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, fraud, illegality, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Effect of Failure to Deny. Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Pleading To Be Concise and Direct; Consistency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or equitable grounds. All statements shall be made subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Construction of Pleadings. All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Capacity. It is not necessary to aver the capacity of a party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity or the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party, except to the extent required to show the jurisdiction of the court. When a party desires to raise an issue as to the legal existence of any party or the capacity of any party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, the party desiring to raise the issue shall do so by specific negative averment, which shall include such supporting particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader's knowledge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Fraud, Mistake, Condition of the Mind. In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Conditions Precedent. In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Official Document or Act. In pleading an official document or official act, it is sufficient to aver that the document was issued or the act done in compliance with law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Judgment. In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or of a board or officer, it is sufficient to aver the judgment or decision without setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Time and Place. For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of a pleading, averments of time and place are material and shall be considered like all other averments of material matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Special Damage. When items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Caption; Names of Parties. Every pleading shall contain a caption setting forth the name of this court, the title of the action, the court number, and a designation as in Rule 7(a). In the caption of the summons and the complaint, the title of the action shall include the names of all the parties, but in other pleadings it is sufficient to state the name of the first party on each side with an appropriate indication of other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Paragraphs; Separate Statements. All averments of claim or defense shall be made in numbered paragraphs, the contents of each of which shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances; and a paragraph may be referred to by number in all succeeding pleadings. Each claim founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence and each defense other than denials shall be stated in a separate count or defense whenever a separation facilitates the clear presentation of the matters set forth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Adoption by Reference; Exhibits. Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or in another pleading or in any motion. A copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is part thereof for all purposes.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 11. Signing of Pleadings, Motions and Other Papers; Sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party. Every pleading, motion, or other paper of the United States shall be signed by an attorney authorized to do so on behalf of the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Department of Justice. A pleading, motion, or other paper of an agency of the United States, authorized by statute to represent itself in judicial proceedings, may be signed by an attorney authorized to do so on behalf of the agency. Each paper shall state the signer's address and telephone number, if any. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings or other papers need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. An unsigned paper shall be stricken unless omission of the signature is corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the pleader or movant attorney or party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Representation To Court. By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after any inquiry reasonable under the circumstances.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Sanctions. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, subject to the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:519 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) How Initiated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) By Motion. A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b). It shall be served as provided in Rule 5, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other period as the court may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. If warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) On Court's Initiative. On its own initiative, the court may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Nature of Sanction; Limitations. A sanction imposed for violation of this rule shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the sanction may consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into court, or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party for a violation of subdivision (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's initiative unless the court issues its order to show cause before a voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Order. When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Inapplicability to Discovery. Subdivisions (a) through (c) of this rule do not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to the provisions of Rules 26 through 37.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When Presented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Unless a different time is prescribed in a statute of the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the United States, or an officer or agency thereof, shall serve an answer to the complaint, or to a cross-claim, or a reply to a counterclaim within 60 days after the service upon the Attorney-in-Charge, International Trade Field Office, Commercial Litigation Branch, Department of Justice, of the pleading in which the claim is asserted; except that,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c), no answer shall be served or filed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(f), involving an order to make confidential information available under section 777(c)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the answer shall be served within 10 days after being served with the summons and complaint. For good cause shown, the court in any action may order a different period of time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any other defendant shall serve an answer within 20 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If service of the summons has been timely waived on request under Rule 4(d), within 60 days after the date when the request for waiver was sent, or within 90 days after that date if the defendant was addressed outside any judicial district of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A party other than the United States or an officer or agency thereof served with a pleading stating a cross-claim against the party shall serve an answer thereto within 20 days after being served. The plaintiff shall serve a reply to a counterclaim in the answer within 20 days after service of the answer, or, if a reply is ordered by the court, within 20 days after service of the order, unless the order otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Unless a different time is fixed by court order, the service of a motion permitted under this rule alters these periods of time as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits, the responsive pleading shall be served within 10 days after notice of the court's action; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading shall be served within 10 days after service of the more definite statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) How Presented. Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) insufficiency of process, (4) insufficiency of service of the summons and complaint, (5) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (6) failure to join a party under Rule 19. A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (5) <!-- PDFPage:520 -->to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside of the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such motion by Rule 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Preliminary Hearings. The defenses specifically enumerated (1)&ndash;(6) in subdivision (b) of this rule, whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment mentioned in subdivision (c) of this rule shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Motion for More Definite Statement. If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after notice of the order or within such time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Motion to Strike. Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Consolidation of Defenses in Motion. A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h)(2) of this rule on any of the grounds there stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, insufficiency of process, or insufficiency of service of the summons and complaint is waived (A) if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision (g) of this rule, or (B) if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a defense of failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 19, and an objection of failure to state a legal defense to a claim may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 13. Counterclaim and Cross-Claim</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if (1) the claim involves the imported merchandise that is the subject matter of the civil action, or (2) the claim is to recover upon a bond or customs duties relating to such merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim. A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Counterclaim Against the United States. These rules shall not be construed to enlarge beyond the limits now fixed by law the right to assert counterclaims or to claim credits against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading. A claim which either matured or was acquired by the pleader after serving a pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Omitted Counterclaim. When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Cross-Claim Against Co-Party. A pleading may state as a cross-claim any claim by one party against a co-party, if (1) the claim involves the imported merchandise that is the subject matter of the civil action, or (2) the claim is to recover upon a bond or customs duties relating to such merchandise. Such cross-claim may include a claim that the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Joinder of Additional Parties. Persons other than those made parties to the original <!-- PDFPage:521 -->action may be made parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim in accordance with the provisions of Rules 19 and 20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Separate Trials&mdash;Separate Judgments. If the court orders separate trials as provided in Rule 42(b), judgment on a counterclaim or cross-claim may be rendered in accordance with the terms of Rule 54(b) when the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party have been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Demand for a Complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the pendency of the civil action on a Reserve or Suspension Calendar, in a civil action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(a) or (b), for good cause shown, a defendant who wishes to proceed expeditiously in the action may file a motion demanding that the plaintiff file a complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The motion shall include, among other information, (A) a statement of the reasons for wanting to proceed at this time, (B) a proposed timetable for requiring the plaintiff to file a complaint if different from the time provided for in this rule and the reasons for a different time, and, in a suspended action, other scheduling information that the defendant believes necessary to enable the court to formulate an order removing a suspended action from a Suspension Calendar, and (C) a description of any counterclaim known to the defendant at the time the motion is filed that the defendant intends to assert in its answer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an order granting a motion for a demand for a complaint is entered, plaintiff shall file its complaint within 30 days after the date of service of the order if plaintiff wishes to continue the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an order granting a motion for a demand for a complaint is entered and plaintiff does not voluntarily dismiss the action or fails to file a complaint, the clerk shall enter an order of dismissal without further direction from the court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 14. Third-Party Practice</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When Defendant May Bring in Third Party. At any time after commencement of the action a defending party, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint to be served upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party plaintiff need not obtain leave to make the service if the third-party plaintiff files the third-party complaint not later than 10 days after serving the original answer. Otherwise the third-party plaintiff must obtain leave on motion upon notice to all parties to the action. The person served with the summons and third-party complaint, hereinafter called the third-party defendant, shall make any defenses to the third-party plaintiff's claim as provided in Rule 12, and any counterclaims against the third-party plaintiff and cross-claims against other third-party defendants as provided in Rule 13. The third-party defendant may assert against the plaintiff any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff's claim. The third-party defendant may also assert any claim against the plaintiff, if (1) the claim involves the imported merchandise that is the subject matter of the civil action, or (2) the claim is to recover upon a bond or customs duties relating to such merchandise. The plaintiff may assert any claim against the third-party defendant, if (1) the claim involves the imported merchandise that is the subject matter of the civil action, or (2) the claim is to recover upon a bond or customs duties relating to such merchandise, and the third-party defendant thereupon shall assert any defenses as provided in Rule 12 and any counterclaims and cross-claims as provided in Rule 13. Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, or for its severance or for a separate trial. A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule against any person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of the claim made in the action against the third-party defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When Plaintiff May Bring in Third Party. When a counterclaim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may cause a third-party to be brought in under circumstances which under this rule would entitle a defendant to do so.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Amendments. A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been noticed for trial, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within 10 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be longer, unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Amendments To Conform to the Evidence. When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice the party in maintaining the party's action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Relation Back of Amendments. An amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</p>
<!-- PDFPage:522 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amendment arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and, within the period provided by Rule 4 for service of the pleadings commencing the action, the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The delivery or mailing of the pleadings commencing the action to the Attorney-in-Charge, International Trade Field Office, Commercial Litigation Branch, Department of Justice, or an agency or officer who would have been a proper defendant if named, satisfies the requirement of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (3) with respect to the United States or any agency or officer thereof to be brought into the action as a defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Supplemental Pleadings. Upon motion of a party, the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit the party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statements of a claim for relief or defense. If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Postassignment Conferences; Objectives. In any action, the court may, in its discretion direct the attorneys for the parties and any unrepresented parties to appear for a conference or conferences for such purposes as</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) expediting the disposition of the action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establishing early and continuing control so that the action will not be protracted because of lack of management;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Scheduling and Planning. Except as provided in Rule 56.2 or when the judge to whom the action is assigned finds that a scheduling order will not aid in the disposition of the action and enters an order to that effect, together with a statement of reasons and facts upon which the order is based, the judge shall, after consulting with the attorneys for the parties and any unrepresented parties, by a scheduling conference, telephone, mail, or other suitable means, enter a scheduling order that limits the time</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to join other parties and to amend the pleadings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to file and hear motions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to complete discovery.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) any other matters appropriate in the circumstances of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The scheduling order, or the order that a scheduling order will not aid in the disposition of the action, shall issue as soon as practicable but in no event more than 90 days after the action is assigned. A schedule shall not be modified except by leave of the judge upon a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subjects to be Discussed at Postassignment Conferences. The participants at any conference under this rule may consider and take action with respect to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the formulation and simplification of the issues, including the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the possibility of obtaining admissions of fact and of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof, stipulations regarding the authenticity of documents, and advance rulings from the court on the admissibility of evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the avoidance of unnecessary proof and of cumulative evidence, and limitations or restrictions on the use of testimony under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the appropriateness and timing of summary adjudication under Rule 56;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the control and scheduling of discovery, including orders affecting disclosure and discovery pursuant to Rule 26 and Rules 29 through 37;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the identification of witnesses and documents, the need and schedule for filing and exchanging briefs, and the date or dates for further conferences and for submission of the action for final disposition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the advisability of referring matters to a master;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the possibility of settlement or the use of extrajudicial procedures to resolve the dispute;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the form and substance of the scheduling or postassignment conference order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the disposition of pending motions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the need for adopting special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or unusual proof problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) an order for a separate trial pursuant to Rule 42(b) with respect to a claim, counter<!-- PDFPage:523 -->claim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or with respect to any particular issue in the case;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) an order directing a party or parties to present evidence early in the trial with respect to a manageable issue that could, on the evidence, be the basis for a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) or a judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) an order establishing a reasonable limit on the time allowed for presenting evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) access to confidential or privileged information, including business proprietary information, contained in an administrative record, which is the subject of the action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">At least one of the attorneys for each party participating in any postassignment conference shall have authority to enter into stipulations and to make admissions regarding all matters that the participants may reasonably anticipate may be discussed. If appropriate, the court may require that a party or its representative be present or reasonably available by telephone in order to consider possible settlement of the dispute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Final Postassignment Conference. Any final postassignment conference shall be held as close to the time of submission of the action for final disposition as reasonable under the circumstances. The participants at any such conference shall formulate a plan for submission of the action for final disposition. At least one of the attorneys on behalf of each of the parties and any unrepresented parties shall participate in the conference.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Orders. After any conference held pursuant to this rule, an order shall be entered reciting the action taken. This order shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order. The order following a final postassignment conference shall be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Sanctions. If a party or party's attorney fails to obey a scheduling or postassignment conference order, or if no appearance is made on behalf of a party at a scheduling or postassignment conference, or if a party or party's attorney is substantially unprepared to participate in the conference, or if a party or party's attorney fails to participate in good faith, the judge, upon motion or the judge's own initiative, may make such orders with regard thereto as are just, and among others any of the orders provided in Rule 37(b). In lieu of or in addition to any other sanction, the judge shall require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, including attorney's fees, unless the judge finds that the noncompliance was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
