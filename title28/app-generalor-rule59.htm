<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Grounds.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A new trial or rehearing or reconsideration may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues, for any of the reasons established by the rules of common law or equity applicable as between private parties in the courts of the United States. On a motion under this rule, the court may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The court, at any time while a suit is pending before it, or after proceedings for review have been instituted, or within 2 years after the final disposition of the suit, may grant the United States a new trial and stay the payment of any judgment upon satisfactory evidence, cumulative or otherwise, that any fraud, wrong, or injustice has been done to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Time for Motion and Response.</strong> Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2), a motion for a new trial, or for amendment or reconsideration of a judgment, shall be filed no later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment. When such a motion is based on affidavits, they shall be filed with the motion. No response to any motion under this rule may be filed, unless requested by the court. The court will not rule in favor of any motion under this rule without first requesting by order a response to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) On Court's Initiative; Notice; Specifying Grounds.</strong> No later than 10 days after entry of judgment the court, on its own, may order a new trial for any reason that would justify granting one on a party's motion. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion. When granting a new trial on its own initiative or for a reason not stated in a motion, the court shall specify the grounds in its order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment.</strong> Any motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in wording were made to more closely conform to FRCP 59. Subdivision (c) was deleted to reflect the difference in Court of Federal Claims practice, set out in subdivision (b), which directs that a response to a RCFC 59 motion is only required when directed by the court, even if the motion is accompanied by an affidavit. Other differences were retained, including the distinction between final and non-final orders, which can be the subject of motions for reconsideration at any time before final judgment.</p>
