<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Entry.</cap-smallcap> A judgment is entered when it is noted on the docket. The clerk must prepare, sign, and enter the judgment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after receiving the court's opinion&mdash;but if settlement of the judgment's form is required, after final settlement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a judgment is rendered without an opinion, as the court instructs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice.</cap-smallcap> On the date when judgment is entered, the clerk must serve on all parties a copy of the opinion&mdash;or the judgment, if no opinion was written&mdash;and a notice of the date when the judgment was entered.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">This is the typical rule. See 1st Cir. Rule 29; 3rd Cir. Rule 32; 6th Cir. Rule 21. At present, uncertainty exists as to the date of entry of judgment when the opinion directs subsequent settlement of the precise terms of the judgment, a common practice in cases involving enforcement of agency orders. See Stern and Gressman, Supreme Court Practice, p. 203 (3d Ed., 1962). The principle of finality suggests that in such cases entry of judgment should be delayed until approval of the judgment in final form.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> Subdivision (b) has been amended so that the clerk may use electronic means to serve a copy of the opinion or judgment or to serve notice of the date when judgment was entered upon parties who have consented to such service.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
