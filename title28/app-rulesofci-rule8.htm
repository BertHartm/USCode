<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Claims for Relief</cap-smallcap>. A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Defenses; Form of Denials</cap-smallcap>. A party shall state in short and plain terms the party's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If a party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the party shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, the pleader shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, the pleader may make denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs or may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the pleader expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all its averments, including averments of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, the pleader may do so by general denial subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative Defenses</cap-smallcap>. In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Failure To Deny</cap-smallcap>. Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Pleading To Be Concise and Direct; Consistency.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal, equitable, or maritime grounds. All statements shall be made subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 11.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Construction of Pleadings</cap-smallcap>. All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. See [former] Equity Rules 25 (Bill of Complaint&mdash;Contents), and 30 (Answer&mdash;Con<!-- PDFPage:107 -->tents&mdash;Counterclaim). Compare 2 Ind.Stat.Ann. (Burns, 1933) &sect;&sect;2&ndash;1004, 2&ndash;1015; 2 Ohio Gen.Code Ann. (Page, 1926) &sect;&sect;11305, 11314; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933), &sect;&sect;104&ndash;7&ndash;2, 104&ndash;9&ndash;1.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 19(c) for the requirement of a statement in a claim for relief of the names of persons who ought to be parties and the reason for their omission.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 23(b) for particular requirements as to the complaint in a secondary action by shareholders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. 1. This rule supersedes the methods of pleading prescribed in U.S.C., Title 19, &sect;508 (Persons making seizures pleading general issue and providing special matter); U.S.C., Title 35, [former] &sect;&sect;40d (Providing under general issue, upon notice, that a statement in application for an extended patent is not true), 69 [now 282] (Pleading and proof in actions for infringement) and similar statutes.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This rule is, in part, [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), with the matter on denials largely from the Connecticut practice. See Conn.Practice Book (1934) &sect;&sect;107, 108, and 122; Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930) &sect;&sect;5508&ndash;5514. Compare the English practice, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 17&ndash;20.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c)</em>. This follows substantially English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r. 15 and N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;242, with &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; omitted in this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. The first sentence is similar to [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim). For the second sentence see [former] Equity Rule 31 (Reply&mdash;When Required&mdash;When Cause at Issue). This is similar to English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 13, 18; and to the practice in the States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e)</em>. This rule is an elaboration upon [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), plus a statement of the actual practice under some codes. Compare also [former] Equity Rule 18 (Pleadings&mdash;Technical Forms Abrogated). See Clark, Code Pleading (1928), pp. 171&ndash;4, 432&ndash;5; Hankin, <em>Alternative and Hypothetical Pleading</em> (1924), 33 Yale L.J. 365.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (f)</em>. A provision of like import is of frequent occurrence in the codes. Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;157(3); 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9266; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;275; 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7458.</p>
