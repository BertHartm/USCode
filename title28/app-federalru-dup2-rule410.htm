<h3 class="section-head">Rule 410. Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a plea of nolo contendere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any statement made in the course of any proceedings under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or comparable state procedure regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">Withdrawn pleas of guilty were held inadmissible in federal prosecutions in <em>Kercheval v. United States</em>, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927). The Court pointed out that to admit the withdrawn plea would effectively set at naught the allowance of withdrawal and place the accused in a dilemma utterly inconsistent with the decision to award him a trial. The New York Court of Appeals, in <em>People v. Spitaleri</em>, 9 N.Y.2d 168, 212 N.Y.S.2d 53, 173 N.E.2d 35 (1961), reexamined and overturned its earlier decisions which had allowed admission. In addition to the reasons set forth in Kercheval, which was quoted at length, the court pointed out that the effect of admitting the plea was to compel defendant to take the stand by way of explanation and to open the way for the prosecution to call the lawyer who had represented him at the time of entering the plea. State court decisions for and against admissibility are collected in Annot., 86 A.L.R.2d 326.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pleas of <em>nolo contendere</em> are recognized by Rule 11 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, although the law of numerous States is to the contrary. The present rule gives effect to the principal traditional characteristic of the <em>nolo</em> plea, i.e., avoiding the admission of guilt which is inherent in pleas of guilty. This position is consistent with the construction of Section 5 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;16(a), recognizing the inconclusive and compromise nature of judgments based on <em>nolo</em> pleas. <em>General Electric Co. v. City of San Antonio</em>, 334 F.2d 480 (5th Cir. 1964); <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co</em>., 323 F.2d 412 (7th Cir. 1963), cert. denied 376 U.S. 939, 84 S.Ct. 794, 11 L.Ed.2d 659; <em>Armco Steel Corp. v. North Dakota</em>, 376 F.2d 206 (8th Cir. 1967); <em>City of Burbank v. General Electric Co</em>., 329 F.2d 825 (9th Cir. 1964). See also state court decisions in Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1314.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exclusion of offers to plead guilty or <em>nolo</em> has as its purpose the promotion of disposition of criminal cases by compromise. As pointed out in McCormick &sect;251, p. 543</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Effective criminal law administration in many localities would hardly be possible if a large proportion of the charges were not disposed of by such compromises.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">See also <em>People v. Hamilton</em>, 60 Cal.2d 105, 32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383 P.2d 412 (1963), discussing legislation designed to achieve this result. As with compromise offers generally, Rule 408, free communication is needed, and security against having an offer of compromise or related statement admitted in evidence effectively encourages it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Limiting the exclusionary rule to use against the accused is consistent with the purpose of the rule, since the possibility of use for or against other persons will not impair the effectiveness of withdrawing pleas or the freedom of discussion which the rule is designed to foster. See A.B.A. Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;2.2 (1968). See also the narrower provisions of New Jersey Evidence Rule 52(2) and the unlimited exclusion provided in California Evidence Code &sect;1153.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added the phrase &ldquo;Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress&rdquo; to Rule 410 as submitted by the Court in order to preserve particular congressional policy judgments as to the effect of a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere. See 15 U.S.C. 16(a). The Committee intends that its amendment refers to both present statutes and statutes subsequently enacted.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of the Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">As adopted by the House, rule 410 would make inadmissible pleas of guilty or nolo contendere subsequently withdrawn as well as offers to make such pleas. Such a rule is clearly justified as a means of encouraging pleading. However, the House rule would then go on to render inadmissible for any purpose statements made in connection with these pleas or offers as well.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee finds this aspect of the House rule unjustified. Of course, in certain circumstances such statements should be excluded. If, for example, a plea is vitiated because of coercion, statements made in connection with the plea may also have been coerced and should be inadmissible on that basis. In other cases, however, voluntary statements of an accused made in court on the record, in connection with a plea, and determined by a court to be reliable should be admissible even though the plea is subsequently withdrawn. This is particularly true in those cases where, if the House rule were in effect, a defendant would be able to contradict his previous statements and thereby lie with impunity [See <em>Harris v. New York</em>, 401 U.S. 222 (1971)]. To prevent such an injustice, the rule has been modified to permit the use of such statements for the limited purposes of impeachment and in subsequent perjury or false statement prosecutions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">The House bill provides that evidence of a guilty or nolo contendere plea, of an offer of either plea, or of statements made in connection with such pleas or offers of such pleas, is inadmissible in any civil or criminal action, case or proceeding against the person making such plea or offer. The Senate amendment makes the rule inapplicable to a voluntary and reliable statement made in court on the record where the statement is offered in a subsequent prosecution of the declarant for perjury or false statement.</p>
<p class="note-body">The issues raised by Rule 410 are also raised by proposed Rule 11(e)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure presently pending before Congress. This proposed rule, which deals with the admissibility of pleas <!-- PDFPage:368 -->of guilty or nolo contendere, offers to make such pleas, and statements made in connection with such pleas, was promulgated by the Supreme Court on April 22, 1974, and in the absence of congressional action will become effective on August 1, 1975. The conferees intend to make no change in the presently-existing case law until that date, leaving the courts free to develop rules in this area on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conferees further determined that the issues presented by the use of guilty and nolo contendere pleas, offers of such pleas, and statements made in connection with such pleas or offers, can be explored in greater detail during Congressional consideration of Rule 11(e)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Conferees believe, therefore, that it is best to defer its effective date until August 1, 1975. The Conferees intend that Rule 410 would be superseded by any subsequent Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure or Act of Congress with which it is inconsistent, if the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure or Act of Congress takes effect or becomes law after the date of the enactment of the act establishing the rules of evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that expresses the above intentions.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Present rule 410 conforms to rule 11(e)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. A proposed amendment to rule 11(e)(6) would clarify the circumstances in which pleas, plea discussions and related statements are inadmissible in evidence; see Advisory Committee Note thereto. The amendment proposed above would make comparable changes in rule 410.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body"><b>1975</b>&mdash;Pub. L. 94&ndash;149 substituted heading reading &ldquo;Inadmissibility of Pleas, Offers of Pleas, and Related Statements&rdquo; for &ldquo;Offer to Plead Guilty; Nolo Contendere; Withdrawn Pleas of Guilty&rdquo;; substituted in first sentence &ldquo;provided in this rule&rdquo; for &ldquo;provided by Act of Congress&rdquo;, inserted therein &ldquo;, and relevant to,&rdquo; following &lsquo;in connection with&rdquo;, and deleted therefrom &ldquo;action, case, or&rdquo; preceding &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo;; added second sentence relating to admissibility of statements in criminal proceedings for perjury or false statements; deleted former second sentence providing that &ldquo;This rule shall not apply to the introduction of voluntary and reliable statements made in court on the record in connection with any of the foregoing pleas or offers where offered for impeachment purposes or in a subsequent prosecution of the declarant for perjury or false statement.&rdquo;; and deleted former second par. providing that &ldquo;This rule shall not take effect until August 1, 1975, and shall be superseded by any amendment to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which is inconsistent with this rule, and which takes effect after the date of the enactment of the Act establishing these Federal Rules of Evidence.&rdquo;</p>
