<h3 class="section-head">Rule 11. Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Every pleading, motion, and other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by or for the attorney of record in the signing attorney's own individual name, whose address and telephone number shall be stated. See Rule 81(d)(2). A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign the pleading, motion, or other paper and state the party's address. Any stipulation for a money judgment shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Attorney General. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. The rule in equity that the averments of an answer under oath must be overcome by the testimony of two witnesses or of one witness sustained by corroborating circumstances is abolished. The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the attorney or party that the attorney or party has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the attorney's or party's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
