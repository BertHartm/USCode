<h4 class="note-head">Practice Comment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The court has established Security Procedures for Safeguarding Confidential Information in the Custody and Control of the Clerk. These procedures apply to confidential information or privileged information received by the court and may include: trade secrets, commercial or financial information, and information provided to the United States by foreign governments or foreign businesses or persons. These procedures do not pertain to national security information.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 11(a) of Security Procedures regulates the transmittal of confidential information to and from the clerk by governmental agencies and private parties. A copy of Section 11(a) is available upon request from, and is posted in the Office of the Clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to the renumbering of the Rules, the former Rule 71 now will be identified as Rule 73.2. New Rule 71 conforms to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
