<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> A party desiring to take a deposition upon written questions shall serve them upon every other party with a notice stating (1) the name and address of the person who is to answer them, if known, and if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs, and (2) the name or descriptive title and address of the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken.

<p class="note-body">RCFC 31 closely parallels the text of FRCP 31. Subdivision (a) is identical in wording to the current federal civil rule. Subdivisions (b) and (c) are nearly identical, the only differences being those necessary to reflect the court's practice of not requiring depositions to be filed.</p>
