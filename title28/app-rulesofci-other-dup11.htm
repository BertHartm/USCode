<p class="statutory-body">A lawsuit has been commenced against you (or the entity on whose behalf you are addressed). A copy of the complaint is attached to this notice. It has been filed in the United States District Court for the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;(D)&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and has been assigned docket number &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;(E)&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">This is not a formal summons or notification from the court, but rather my request that you sign and return the enclosed waiver of service in order to save the cost of serving you with a judicial summons and an additional copy of the complaint.

I enclose a stamped and addressed envelope (or other means of cost-free return) for your use. An extra copy of the waiver is also attached for your records.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If you comply with this request and return the signed waiver, it will be filed with the court and no summons will be served on you. The action will then proceed as if you had been served on the date the waiver is filed, except that you will not be obligated to answer the complaint before 60 days from the date designated below as the date on which this notice is sent (or before 90 days from that date if your address is not in any judicial district of the United States).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If you do not return the signed waiver within the time indicated, I will take appropriate steps to effect formal service in a manner authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and will then, to the extent authorized by those Rules, ask the court to require you (or the party on whose behalf you are addressed) to pay the full costs of such service. In that connection, please read the statement concerning the duty of parties to waive the service of the summons, which is set forth on the reverse side (or at the foot) of the waiver form.</p>

<h4 class="note-head"><em>To be printed on reverse side of the waiver form or set forth at the foot of the form:</em></h4>
I74Duty to Avoid Unnecessary Costs of Service of Summons<p class="note-body">Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain parties to cooperate in saving unnecessary costs of service of the summons and complaint. A defendant located in the United States who, after being notified of an action and asked by a plaintiff located in the United States to waive service of a summons, fails to do so will be required to bear the cost of such service unless good cause be shown for its failure to sign and return the waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is not good cause for a failure to waive service that a party believes that the complaint is unfounded, or that the action has been brought in an improper place or in a court that lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or over its person or property. A party who waives service of the summons retains all defenses and objections (except any relating to the summons or to the service of the summons), and may later object to the jurisdiction of the court or to the place where the action has been brought.</p>
<p class="note-body">A defendant who waives service must within the time specified on the waiver form serve on the plaintiff's attorney (or unrepresented plaintiff) a response to the complaint and must also file a signed copy of the response with the court. If the answer or motion is not served within this time, a default judgment may be taken against that defendant. By waiving service, a defendant is allowed more time to answer than if the summons had been actually served when the request for waiver of service was received.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Explanatory Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. <em>Diversity of Citizenship</em>. U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;1332 (Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs), as amended by P.L. 85&ndash;554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, states in subsection (c) that &ldquo;For the purposes of this section and section 1441 of this title [removable actions], a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.&rdquo; Thus if the defendant corporation in Form 2(a) had its principal place of business in Connecticut, diversity of citizenship would not exist. An allegation regarding the principal place of business of each corporate party must be made in addition to an allegation regarding its place of incorporation.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. <em>Jurisdictional Amount</em>. U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;1331 (Federal question; amount in controversy; costs) and &sect;1332 (Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs), as amended by P.L. 85&ndash;554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, require that the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, be in excess of $10,000. The allegation as to the amount in controversy may be omitted in any case where by law no jurisdictional amount is required. See, for example, U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;1338 (Patents, copyrights, trade-marks, and unfair competition), &sect;1343 (Civil rights and elective franchise).</p>
<p class="note-body">3. <em>Pleading Venue</em>. Since improper venue is a matter of defense, it is not necessary for plaintiff to include allegations showing the venue to be proper. See 1 Moore's Federal Practice, par. 0.140 [1.&mdash;4] (2d ed. 1959).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Since the Civil Rules have not heretofore been applicable to proceedings in Admiralty (Rule 81(a)(1)), Form 2 naturally has not contained a provision for invoking the admiralty jurisdiction. The form has never purported to be comprehensive, as making provision for all possible grounds of jurisdiction; but a provision for invoking the admiralty jurisdiction is particularly appropriate as an incident of unification.</p>
<p class="note-body">Certain distinctive features of the admiralty practice must be preserved in unification, just as certain distinctive characteristics of equity were preserved in the merger of law and equity in 1938. Rule 9(h) provides the device whereby, after unification, with its abolition of the distinction between civil actions and suits in admiralty, the pleader may indicate his choice of the distinctively maritime procedures, and designates those features that are preserved. This form illustrates an appropriate way in which the pleader may invoke those procedures. Use of this device is not necessary if the claim is cognizable only by virtue of the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, nor if the claim is within the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Omission of a statement such as this from the pleading indicates the pleader's choice that the action proceed as a conventional civil action, if this is jurisdictionally possible, without the distinctive maritime remedies and procedures. It should be remembered, however, that Rule 9(h) provides that a pleading may be amended to add or withdraw such an identifying statement subject to the principles stated in Rule 15.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This form is revised to reflect amendments to 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1331 and 1332 providing jurisdiction for federal questions without regard to the amount in controversy and raising the amount required to be in controversy in diversity cases to fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p class="note-body">At various places, these Forms [Forms 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 21] allege or refer to damages of &ldquo;ten thousand dollars, interest, and costs,&rdquo; or the like. The Forms were written at a time when the jurisdictional amount in ordinary &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Federal question&rdquo; cases was an amount in excess of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, so the illustrative amounts set out in the Forms were adequate for jurisdictional purposes. However, U.S.C. Title 28, &sect;1331 (Federal question; amount in controversy; costs) and &sect;1332 (Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs), as amended by Pub. Law 85&ndash;554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, now require that the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, be in excess of $10,000. Accordingly the Forms are misleading. They are amended at appropriate places by deleting the stated dollar amount and substituting a blank, to be properly filled in by the pleader.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">5. Since March 10, 1936, said book has been published by plaintiff and all copies of it made by plaintiff or under his authority or license have been printed, bound, and published in strict conformity with the provisions of the Act of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and all other laws governing copyright.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. Since March 10, 1936, plaintiff has been and still is the sole proprietor of all rights, title, and interest in and to the copyright in said book.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">7. After March 10, 1936, defendant infringed said copyright by publishing and placing upon the market a book entitled &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, which was copied largely from plaintiff's copyrighted book, entitled &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. Allegation of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. On or about June 1, 1935, plaintiff issued to G. H. a policy of life insurance whereby plaintiff promised to pay to K. L. as beneficiary the sum of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; dollars upon the death of G. H. The policy required the payment by G. H. of a stipulated premium on June 1, 1936, and annually thereafter as a condition precedent to its continuance in force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. No part of the premium due June 1, 1936, was ever paid and the policy ceased to have any force or effect on July 1, 1936.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. Thereafter, on September 1, 1936, G. H. and K. L. died as the result of a collision between a locomotive and the automobile in which G. H. and K. L. were riding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. Defendant C. D. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of G. H.; defendant E. F. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of K. L.; defendant X. Y. claims to have been duly designated as beneficiary of said policy in place of K. L.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. Each of defendants, C. D., E. F., and X. Y. is claiming that the above-mentioned policy was in full force and effect at the time of the death of G. H.; each of them is claiming to be the only person entitled to receive payment of the amount of the policy and has made demand for payment thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">7. By reason of these conflicting claims of the defendants, plaintiff is in great doubt as to which defendant is entitled to be paid the amount of the policy, if it was in force at the death of G. H.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Wherefore plaintiff demands that the court adjudge:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) That none of the defendants is entitled to recover from plaintiff the amount of said policy or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) That each of the defendants be restrained from instituting any action against plaintiff for the recovery of the amount of said policy or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) That, if the court shall determine that said policy was in force at the death of G. H., the defendants be required to interplead and settle between themselves their rights to the money due under said policy, and that plaintiff be discharged from all liability in the premises except to the person whom the court shall adjudge entitled to the amount of said policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) That plaintiff recover its costs.</p>

<p class="note-body">Under the amendment of Rule 14(a), a defendant who files a third-party complaint not later than 10 days after serving his original answer need not obtain leave of court to bring in the third-party defendant by service under Rule 4. Form 22&ndash;A is intended for use in these cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The changes in the form of summons reflect an earlier amendment of Rule 14(a), effective in 1948, making it permissive, rather than mandatory, for the third-party defendant to answer the plaintiff's complaint. See <em>Cooper v. D/S A/S Progress</em>, 188 F.Supp. 578 (E.D.Pa. 1960); 1A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 696 (Wright ed. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment of Rule 5(a) requiring, with certain exceptions, that papers be served upon all the parties to the action, the third-party defendant, even if he makes no answer to the plaintiff's complaint, is obliged to serve upon the plaintiff a copy of his answer to the third-party complaint. Similarly, the defendant is obliged to serve upon the plaintiff a copy of the summons and complaint against the third-party defendant.</p>

Section 308 modified 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(2) to enhance the potential of parties consenting to trial before a magistrate judge. While the exercise of jurisdiction by a magistrate judge remains dependent on the voluntary consent of the parties, the statute provides that the parties should be advised, and may be reminded, of the availability of this option and eliminates the proscription against judicial suggestions of the potential benefits of referral provided the parties are also advised that they &ldquo;are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences.&rdquo; The parties may be advised if the withholding of consent will result in a potential delay in trial.</p>
