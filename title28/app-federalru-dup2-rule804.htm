<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition of Unavailability.</cap-smallcap> &ldquo;Unavailability as a witness&rdquo; includes situations in which the declarant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement despite an order of the court to do so; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant's statement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant's attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or (4), the declarant's attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Hearsay Exceptions.</cap-smallcap> The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Former Testimony.</em> Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Statement Under Belief of Impending Death.</em> In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil action or proceeding, a statement made by a declarant while believing that the declarant's death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be impending death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Statement against interest.</em> A statement that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it was so contrary to the declarant's proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant's claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness, if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Statement of Personal or Family History.</em> (A) A statement concerning the declarant's own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or (B) a statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the other's family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">[(5) <em>Other Exceptions.] [Transferred to Rule 807]</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Forfeiture by Wrongdoing.</em> A statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">As to firsthand knowledge on the part of hearsay declarants, see the introductory portion of the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 803.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The definition of unavailability implements the division of hearsay exceptions into two categories by Rules 803 and 804(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">At common law the unavailability requirement was evolved in connection with particular hearsay exceptions rather than along general lines. For example, see the separate explication of unavailability in relation to former testimony, declarations against interest, and <!-- PDFPage:417 -->statements of pedigree, separately developed in McCormick &sect;&sect;234, 257, and 297. However, no reason is apparent for making distinctions as to what satisfies unavailability for the different exceptions. The treatment in the rule is therefore uniform although differences in the range of process for witnesses between civil and criminal cases will lead to a less exacting requirement under item (5). See Rule 45(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 17(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Five instances of unavailability are specified:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Substantial authority supports the position that exercise of a claim of privilege by the declarant satisfies the requirement of unavailability (usually in connection with former testimony). <em>Wyatt v. State</em>, 35 Ala.App. 147, 46 So.2d 837 (1950); <em>State v. Stewart</em>, 85 Kan. 404, 116 P. 489 (1911); Annot., 45 A.L.R.2d 1354; Uniform Rule 62(7)(a); California Evidence Code &sect;240(a)(1); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(g) (1). A ruling by the judge is required, which clearly implies that an actual claim of privilege must be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A witness is rendered unavailable if he simply refuses to testify concerning the subject matter of his statement despite judicial pressures to do so, a position supported by similar considerations of practicality. <em>Johnson v. People</em>, 152 Colo. 586, 384 P.2d 454 (1963); <em>People v. Pickett</em>, 339 Mich. 294, 63 N.W.2d 681, 45 A.L.R.2d 1341 (1954). <em>Contra, Pleau v. State</em>, 255 Wis. 362, 38 N.W.2d 496 (1949).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The position that a claimed lack of memory by the witness of the subject matter of his statement constitutes unavailability likewise finds support in the cases, though not without dissent. McCormick &sect;234, p. 494. If the claim is successful, the practical effect is to put the testimony beyond reach, as in the other instances. In this instance, however, it will be noted that the lack of memory must be established by the testimony of the witness himself, which clearly contemplates his production and subjection to cross-examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Death and infirmity find general recognition as ground. McCormick &sect;&sect;234, 257, 297; Uniform Rule 62(7)(c); California Evidence Code &sect;240(a)(3); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(g)(3); New Jersey Evidence Rule 62(6)(c). See also the provisions on use of depositions in Rule 32(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 15(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Absence from the hearing coupled with inability to compel attendance by process or other reasonable means also satisfies the requirement. McCormick &sect;234; Uniform Rule 62(7)(d) and (e); California Evidence Code &sect;240(a)(4) and (5); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(g)(4) and (5); New Jersey Rule 62(6)(b) and (d). See the discussion of procuring attendance of witnesses who are nonresidents or in custody in <em>Barber v. Page</em>, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the conditions otherwise constituting unavailability result from the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the statement, the requirement is not satisfied. The rule contains no requirement that an attempt be made to take the deposition of a declarant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Rule 803 <em>supra</em>, is based upon the assumption that a hearsay statement falling within one of its exceptions possesses qualities which justify the conclusion that whether the declarant is available or unavailable is not a relevant factor in determining admissibility. The instant rule proceeds upon a different theory: hearsay which admittedly is not equal in quality to testimony of the declarant on the stand may nevertheless be admitted if the declarant is unavailable and if his statement meets a specified standard. The rule expresses preferences: testimony given on the stand in person is preferred over hearsay, and hearsay, if of the specified quality, is preferred over complete loss of the evidence of the declarant. The exceptions evolved at common law with respect to declarations of unavailable declarants furnish the basis for the exceptions enumerated in the proposal. The term &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; is defined in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (1)</em>. Former testimony does not rely upon some set of circumstances to substitute for oath and cross-examination, since both oath and opportunity to cross-examine were present in fact. The only missing one of the ideal conditions for the giving of testimony is the presence of trier and opponent (&ldquo;demeanor evidence&rdquo;). This is lacking with all hearsay exceptions. Hence it may be argued that former testimony is the strongest hearsay and should be included under Rule 803, <em>supra</em>. However, opportunity to observe demeanor is what in a large measure confers depth and meaning upon oath and cross-examination. Thus in cases under Rule 803 demeanor lacks the significance which it possesses with respect to testimony. In any event, the tradition, founded in experience, uniformly favors production of the witness if he is available. The exception indicates continuation of the policy. This preference for the presence of the witness is apparent also in rules and statutes on the use of depositions, which deal with substantially the same problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the exception, the testimony may be offered (1) against the party <em>against</em> whom it was previously offered or (2) against the party <em>by</em> whom it was previously offered. In each instance the question resolves itself into whether fairness allows imposing, upon the party against whom now offered, the handling of the witness on the earlier occasion. (1) If the party against whom now offered is the one against whom the testimony was offered previously, no unfairness is apparent in requiring him to accept his own prior conduct of cross-examination or decision not to cross-examine. Only demeanor has been lost, and that is inherent in the situation. (2) If the party against whom now offered is the one <em>by</em> whom the testimony was offered previously, a satisfactory answer becomes somewhat more difficult. One possibility is to proceed somewhat along the line of an adoptive admission, i.e. by offering the testimony proponent in effect adopts it. However, this theory savors of discarded concepts of witnesses&rsquo; belonging to a party, of litigants&rsquo; ability to pick and choose witnesses, and of vouching for one's own witnesses. Cf. McCormick &sect;246, pp. 526&ndash;527; 4 Wigmore &sect;1075. A more direct and acceptable approach is simply to recognize direct and redirect examination of one's own witness as the equivalent of cross-examining an opponent's witness. Falknor, Former Testimony and the Uniform Rules: A Comment, 38 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 651, n. 1 (1963); McCormick &sect;231, p. 483. See also 5 Wigmore &sect;1389. Allowable techniques for dealing with hostile, doublecrossing, forgetful, and mentally deficient witnesses leave no substance to a claim that one could not adequately develop his own witness at the former hearing. An even less appealing argument is presented when failure to develop fully was the result of a deliberate choice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The common law did not limit the admissibility of former testimony to that given in an earlier trial of the same case, although it did require identity of issues as a means of insuring that the former handling of the witness was the equivalent of what would now be done if the opportunity were presented. Modern decisions reduce the requirement to &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; identity. McCormick &sect;233. Since identity of issues is significant only in that it bears on motive and interest in developing fully the testimony of the witness, expressing the matter in the latter terms is preferable. <em>Id</em>. Testimony given at a preliminary hearing was held in <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970), to satisfy confrontation requirements in this respect.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a further assurance of fairness in thrusting upon a party the prior handling of the witness, the common law also insisted upon identity of parties, deviating only to the extent of allowing substitution of successors in a narrowly construed privity. Mutuality as an aspect of identity is now generally discredited, and the requirement of identity of the offering party disappears except as it might affect motive to develop the testimony. Falknor, <em>supra</em>, at 652; McCormick &sect;232, pp. 487&ndash;488. The question remains whether strict identity, or privity, should continue as a requirement with respect to the party against whom offered. The rule de<!-- PDFPage:418 -->parts to the extent of allowing substitution of one with the right and opportunity to develop the testimony with similar motive and interest. This position is supported by modern decisions. McCormick &sect;232, pp. 489&ndash;490; 5 Wigmore &sect;1388.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of the same tenor will be found in Uniform Rule 63(3)(b); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1290&ndash;1292; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(c)(2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(3). Unlike the rule, the latter three provide either that former testimony is not admissible if the right of confrontation is denied or that it is not admissible if the accused was not a party to the prior hearing. The genesis of these limitations is a caveat in Uniform Rule 63(3) Comment that use of former testimony against an accused may violate his right of confrontation. <em>Mattox v. United States</em>, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895), held that the right was not violated by the Government's use, on a retrial of the same case, of testimony given at the first trial by two witnesses since deceased. The decision leaves open the questions (1) whether direct and redirect are equivalent to cross-examination for purposes of confrontation, (2) whether testimony given in a different proceeding is acceptable, and (3) whether the accused must himself have been a party to the earlier proceeding or whether a similarly situated person will serve the purpose. Professor Falknor concluded that, if a dying declaration untested by cross-examination is constitutionally admissible, former testimony tested by the cross-examination of one similarly situated does not offend against confrontation. Falknor, <em>supra</em>, at 659&ndash;660. The constitutional acceptability of dying declarations has often been conceded. <em>Mattox v. United States</em>, 156 U.S. 237, 243, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895); <em>Kirby v. United States</em>, 174 U.S. 47, 61, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899); <em>Pointer v. Texas</em>, 380 U.S. 400, 407, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (2)</em>. The exception is the familiar dying declaration of the common law, expanded somewhat beyond its traditionally narrow limits. While the original religious justification for the exception may have lost its conviction for some persons over the years, it can scarcely be doubted that powerful psychological pressures are present. See 5 Wigmore &sect;1443 and the classic statement of Chief Baron Eyre in <em>Rex v. Woodcock</em>, 1 Leach 500, 502, 168 Eng.Rep. 352, 353 (K.B. 1789).</p>
<p class="note-body">The common law required that the statement be that of the victim, offered in a prosecution for criminal homicide. Thus declarations by victims in prosecutions for other crimes, e.g. a declaration by a rape victim who dies in childbirth, and all declarations in civil cases were outside the scope of the exception. An occasional statute has removed these restrictions, as in Colo.R.S. &sect;52&ndash;1&ndash;20, or has expanded the area of offenses to include abortions, 5 Wigmore &sect;1432, p. 224, n. 4. Kansas by decision extended the exception to civil cases. <em>Thurston v. Fritz</em>, 91 Kan. 468, 138 P. 625 (1914). While the common law exception no doubt originated as a result of the exceptional need for the evidence in homicide cases, the theory of admissibility applies equally in civil cases and in prosecutions for crimes other than homicide. The same considerations suggest abandonment of the limitation to circumstances attending the event in question, yet when the statement deals with matters other than the supposed death, its influence is believed to be sufficiently attenuated to justify the limitation. Unavailability is not limited to death. See subdivision (a) of this rule. Any problem as to declarations phrased in terms of opinion is laid at rest by Rule 701, and continuation of a requirement of first-hand knowledge is assured by Rule 602.</p>
<p class="note-body">Comparable provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63 (5); California Evidence Code &sect;1242; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(e); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(5).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (3)</em>. The circumstantial guaranty of reliability for declarations against interest is the assumption that persons do not make statements which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied for good reason that they are true. <em>Hileman v. Northwest Engineering Co</em>., 346 F.2d 668 (6th Cir. 1965). If the statement is that of a party, offered by his opponent, it comes in as an admission, Rule 803(d)(2), and there is no occasion to inquire whether it is against interest, this not being a condition precedent to admissibility of admissions by opponents.</p>
<p class="note-body">The common law required that the interest declared against be pecuniary or proprietary but within this limitation demonstrated striking ingenuity in discovering an against-interest aspect. <em>Higham v. Ridgeway</em>, 10 East 109, 103 Eng.Rep. 717 (K.B. 1808); <em>Reg. v. Overseers of Birmingham</em>, 1 B. & S. 763, 121 Eng.Rep. 897 (Q.B. 1861); McCormick, &sect;256, p. 551, nn. 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception discards the common law limitation and expands to the full logical limit. One result is to remove doubt as to the admissibility of declarations tending to establish a tort liability against the declarant or to extinguish one which might be asserted by him, in accordance with the trend of the decisions in this country. McCormick &sect;254, pp. 548&ndash;549. Another is to allow statements tending to expose declarant to hatred, ridicule, or disgrace, the motivation here being considered to be as strong as when financial interests are at stake. McCormick &sect;255, p. 551. And finally, exposure to criminal liability satisfies the against-interest requirement. The refusal of the common law to concede the adequacy of a penal interest was no doubt indefensible in logic, see the dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Donnelly v. United States</em>, 228 U.S. 243, 33 S.Ct. 449, 57 L.Ed. 820 (1913), but one senses in the decisions a distrust of evidence of confessions by third persons offered to exculpate the accused arising from suspicions of fabrication either of the fact of the making of the confession or in its contents, enhanced in either instance by the required unavailability of the declarant. Nevertheless, an increasing amount of decisional law recognizes exposure to punishment for crime as a sufficient stake. <em>People v. Spriggs</em>, 60 Cal.2d 868, 36 Cal.Rptr. 841, 389 P.2d 377 (1964); <em>Sutter v. Easterly</em>, 354 Mo. 282, 189 S.W.2d 284 (1945); <em>Band's Refuse Removal, Inc. v. Fairlawn Borough</em>, 62 N.J.Super. 552, 163 A.2d 465 (1960); <em>Newberry v. Commonwealth</em>, 191 Va. 445, 61 S.E.2d 318 (1950); Annot., 162 A.L.R. 446. The requirement of corroboration is included in the rule in order to effect an accommodation between these competing considerations. When the statement is offered by the accused by way of exculpation, the resulting situation is not adapted to control by rulings as to the weight of the evidence and, hence the provision is cast in terms of a requirement preliminary to admissibility. Cf. Rule 406(a). The requirement of corroboration should be construed in such a manner as to effectuate its purpose of circumventing fabrication.</p>
<p class="note-body">Ordinarily the third-party confession is thought of in terms of exculpating the accused, but this is by no means always or necessarily the case: it may include statements implicating him, and under the general theory of declarations against interest they would be admissible as related statements. <em>Douglas v. Alabama</em>, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), and <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, 19 L.Ed.2d 70 (1968), both involved confessions by codefendants which implicated the accused. While the confession was not actually offered in evidence in <em>Douglas</em>, the procedure followed effectively put it before the jury, which the Court ruled to be error. Whether the confession might have been admissible as a declaration against penal interest was not considered or discussed. <em>Bruton</em> assumed the inadmissibility, as against the accused, of the implicating confession of his codefendant, and centered upon the question of the effectiveness of a limiting instruction. These decisions, however, by no means require that all statements implicating another person be excluded from the category of declarations against interest. Whether a statement is in fact against interest must be determined from the circumstances of each case. Thus a statement admitting guilt and implicating another person, made while in custody, may well be motivated by a desire to curry favor with the authorities and hence fail to qualify as against interest. See <!-- PDFPage:419 -->the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice White in <em>Bruton</em>. On the other hand, the same words spoken under different circumstances, <em>e.g</em>., to an acquaintance, would have no difficulty in qualifying. The rule does not purport to deal with questions of the right of confrontation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The balancing of self-serving against dissenting aspects of a declaration is discussed in McCormick &sect;256.</p>
<p class="note-body">For comparable provisions, see Uniform Rule 63(10): California Evidence Code &sect;1230; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(j); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(10).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (4)</em>. The general common law requirement that a declaration in this area must have been made <em>ante litem motam</em> has been dropped, as bearing more appropriately on weight than admissibility. See 5 Wigmore &sect;1483. Item (i)[(A)] specifically disclaims any need of firsthand knowledge respecting declarant's own personal history. In some instances it is self-evident (marriage) and in others impossible and traditionally not required (date of birth). Item (ii)[(B)] deals with declarations concerning the history of another person. As at common law, declarant is qualified if related by blood or marriage. 5 Wigmore &sect;1489. In addition, and contrary to the common law, declarant qualifies by virtue of intimate association with the family. <em>Id</em>., &sect;1487. The requirement sometimes encountered that when the subject of the statement is the relationship between two other persons the declarant must qualify as to both is omitted. Relationship is reciprocal. <em>Id</em>., &sect;1491.</p>
<p class="note-body">For comparable provisions, see Uniform Rule 63 (23), (24), (25); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1310, 1311; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(u), (v), (w); New Jersey Evidence Rules 63(23), 63(24), 63(25).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(a)(3) was approved in the form submitted by the Court. However, the Committee intends no change in existing federal law under which the court may choose to disbelieve the declarant's testimony as to his lack of memory. See <em>United States v. Insana</em>, 423 F.2d 1165, 1169&ndash;1170 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 841 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(a)(5) as submitted to the Congress provided, as one type of situation in which a declarant would be deemed &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;, that he be &ldquo;absent from the hearing and the proponent of his statement has been unable to procure his attendance by process or other reasonable means.&rdquo; The Committee amended the Rule to insert after the word &ldquo;attendance&rdquo; the parenthetical expression &ldquo;(or, in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or (4), his attendance or testimony)&rdquo;. The amendment is designed primarily to require that an attempt be made to depose a witness (as well as to seek his attendance) as a precondition to the witness being deemed unavailable. The Committee, however, recognized the propriety of an exception to this additional requirement when it is the declarant's former testimony that is sought to be admitted under subdivision (b)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(b)(1) as submitted by the Court allowed prior testimony of an unavailable witness to be admissible if the party against whom it is offered or a person &ldquo;with motive and interest similar&rdquo; to his had an opportunity to examine the witness. The Committee considered that it is generally unfair to impose upon the party against whom the hearsay evidence is being offered responsibility for the manner in which the witness was previously handled by another party. The sole exception to this, in the Committee's view, is when a party's predecessor in interest in a civil action or proceeding had an opportunity and similar motive to examine the witness. The Committee amended the Rule to reflect these policy determinations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(b)(3) as submitted by the Court (now Rule 804(b)(2) in the bill) proposed to expand the traditional scope of the dying declaration exception (i.e. a statement of the victim in a homicide case as to the cause or circumstances of his believed imminent death) to allow such statements in all criminal and civil cases. The Committee did not consider dying declarations as among the most reliable forms of hearsay. Consequently, it amended the provision to limit their admissibility in criminal cases to homicide prosecutions, where exceptional need for the evidence is present. This is existing law. At the same time, the Committee approved the expansion to civil actions and proceedings where the stakes do not involve possible imprisonment, although noting that this could lead to forum shopping in some instances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(b)(4) as submitted by the Court (now Rule 804(b)(3) in the bill) provided as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em"><em>Statement against interest.&mdash;</em>A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest or so far tended to subject him to civil or criminal liability or to render invalid a claim by him against another or to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace, that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true. A statement tending to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee determined to retain the traditional hearsay exception for statements against pecuniary or proprietary interest. However, it deemed the Court's additional references to statements tending to subject a declarant to civil liability or to render invalid a claim by him against another to be redundant as included within the scope of the reference to statements against pecuniary or proprietary interest. See <em>Gichner v. Antonio Triano Tile and Marble Co</em>., 410 F.2d 238 (D.C. Cir. 1968). Those additional references were accordingly deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Court's Rule also proposed to expand the hearsay limitation from its present federal limitation to include statements subjecting the declarant to criminal liability and statements tending to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace. The Committee eliminated the latter category from the subdivision as lacking sufficient guarantees of reliability. See <em>United States v. Dovico</em>, 380 F.2d 325, 327nn.2,4 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 944 (1967). As for statements against penal interest, the Committee shared the view of the Court that some such statements do possess adequate assurances of reliability and should be admissible. It believed, however, as did the Court, that statements of this type tending to exculpate the accused are more suspect and so should have their admissibility conditioned upon some further provision insuring trustworthiness. The proposal in the Court Rule to add a requirement of simple corroboration was, however, deemed ineffective to accomplish this purpose since the accused's own testimony might suffice while not necessarily increasing the reliability of the hearsay statement. The Committee settled upon the language &ldquo;unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement&rdquo; as affording a proper standard and degree of discretion. It was contemplated that the result in such cases as <em>Donnelly v. United States</em>, 228 U.S. 243 (1912), where the circumstances plainly indicated reliability, would be changed. The Committee also added to the Rule the final sentence from the 1971 Advisory Committee draft, designed to codify the doctrine of <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). The Committee does not intend to affect the existing exception to the <em>Bruton</em> principle where the codefendant takes the stand and is subject to cross-examination, but believed there was no need to make specific provision for this situation in the Rule, since in that even the declarant would not be &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of rule 804 as submitted by the Supreme Court defined the conditions under which a witness was considered to be unavailable. It was amended in the House.</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the amendment, according to the report of the House Committee on the Judiciary, is &ldquo;primarily to require that an attempt be made to depose a witness (as well as to seek his attendance) as a precondition to the witness being unavailable.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:420 --><p class="note-body">Under the House amendment, before a witness is declared unavailable, a party must try to depose a witness (declarant) with respect to dying declarations, declarations against interest, and declarations of pedigree. None of these situations would seem to warrant this needless, impractical and highly restrictive complication. A good case can be made for eliminating the unavailability requirement entirely for declarations against interest cases. [Uniform rule 63(10); Kan. Stat. Anno. 60&ndash;460(j); 2A N.J. Stats. Anno. 84&ndash;63(10).]</p>
<p class="note-body">In dying declaration cases, the declarant will usually, though not necessarily, be deceased at the time of trial. Pedigree statements which are admittedly and necessarily based largely on word of mouth are not greatly fortified by a deposition requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Depositions are expensive and time-consuming. In any event, deposition procedures are available to those who wish to resort to them. Moreover, the deposition procedures of the Civil Rules and Criminal Rules are only imperfectly adapted to implementing the amendment. No purpose is served unless the deposition, if taken, may be used in evidence. Under Civil Rule (a)(3) and Criminal Rule 15(e), a deposition, though taken, may not be admissible, and under Criminal Rule 15(a) substantial obstacles exist in the way of even taking a deposition.</p>
<p class="note-body">For these reasons, the committee deleted the House amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee understands that the rule as to unavailability, as explained by the Advisory Committee &ldquo;contains no requirement that an attempt be made to take the deposition of a declarant.&rdquo; In reflecting the committee's judgment, the statement is accurate insofar as it goes. Where, however, the proponent of the statement, with knowledge of the existence of the statement, fails to confront the declarant with the statement at the taking of the deposition, then the proponent should not, in fairness, be permitted to treat the declarant as &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; simply because the declarant was not amendable to process compelling his attendance at trial. The committee does not consider it necessary to amend the rule to this effect because such a situation abuses, not conforms to, the rule. Fairness would preclude a person from introducing a hearsay statement on a particular issue if the person taking the deposition was aware of the issue at the time of the deposition but failed to depose the unavailable witness on that issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former testimony.&mdash;Rule 804(b)(1) as submitted by the Court allowed prior testimony of an unavailable witness to be admissible if the party against whom it is offered or a person &ldquo;with motive and interest similar&rdquo; to his had an opportunity to examine the witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House amended the rule to apply only to a party's predecessor in interest. Although the committee recognizes considerable merit to the rule submitted by the Supreme Court, a position which has been advocated by many scholars and judges, we have concluded that the difference between the two versions is not great and we accept the House amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule defines those statements which are considered to be against interest and thus of sufficient trustworthiness to be admissible even though hearsay. With regard to the type of interest declared against, the version submitted by the Supreme Court included inter alia, statements tending to subject a declarant to civil liability or to invalidate a claim by him against another. The House struck these provisions as redundant. In view of the conflicting case law construing pecuniary or proprietary interests narrowly so as to exclude, e.g., tort cases, this deletion could be misconstrued.</p>
<p class="note-body">Three States which have recently codified their rules of evidence have followed the Supreme Court's version of this rule, i.e., that a statement is against interest if it tends to subject a declarant to civil liability. [Nev. Rev. Stats. &sect;51.345; N. Mex. Stats. (1973 supp.) &sect;20&ndash;4&ndash;804(4); West's Wis. Stats. Anno. (1973 supp.) &sect;908.045(4).]</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee believes that the reference to statements tending to subject a person to civil liability constitutes a desirable clarification of the scope of the rule. Therefore, we have reinstated the Supreme Court language on this matter.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Court rule also proposed to expand the hearsay limitation from its present federal limitation to include statements subjecting the declarant to statements tending to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace. The House eliminated the latter category from the subdivision as lacking sufficient guarantees of reliability. Although there is considerable support for the admissibility of such statements (all three of the State rules referred to supra, would admit such statements), we accept the deletion by the House.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House amended this exception to add a sentence making inadmissible a statement or confession offered against the accused in a criminal case, made by a codefendant or other person implicating both himself and the accused. The sentence was added to codify the constitutional principle announced in <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). <em>Bruton</em> held that the admission of the extrajudicial hearsay statement of one codefendant inculpating a second codefendant violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee decided to delete this provision because the basic approach of the rules is to avoid codifying, or attempting to codify, constitutional evidentiary principles, such as the fifth amendment's right against self-incrimination and, here, the sixth amendment's right of confrontation. Codification of a constitutional principle is unnecessary and, where the principle is under development, often unwise. Furthermore, the House provision does not appear to recognize the exceptions to the <em>Bruton</em> rule, e.g. where the codefendant takes the stand and is subject to cross examination; where the accused confessed, see <em>United States v. Mancusi</em>, 404 F.2d 296 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied 397 U.S. 942 (1907); where the accused was placed at the scene of the crime, see <em>United States v. Zelker</em>, 452 F.2d 1009 (2d Cir. 1971). For these reasons, the committee decided to delete this provision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)(5)</em>. See Note to Paragraph (24), Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277, set out as a note under rule 803 of these rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804 defines what hearsay statements are admissible in evidence if the declarant is unavailable as a witness. The Senate amendments make four changes in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) defines the term &ldquo;unavailability as a witness&rdquo;. The House bill provides in subsection (a)(5) that the party who desires to use the statement must be unable to procure the declarant's attendance by process or other reasonable means. In the case of dying declarations, statements against interest and statements of personal or family history, the House bill requires that the proponent must also be unable to procure the declarant's <em>testimony</em> (such as by deposition or interrogatories) by process or other reasonable means. The Senate amendment eliminates this latter provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the provision contained in the House bill.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment to subsection (b)(3) provides that a statement is against interest and not excluded by the hearsay rule when the declarant is unavailable as a witness, if the statement tends to subject a person to civil or criminal liability or renders invalid a claim by him against another. The House bill did not refer specifically to civil liability and to rendering invalid a claim against another. The Senate amendment also deletes from the House bill the provision that subsection (b)(3) does not apply to a statement or confession, made by a codefendant or another, which implicates the accused and the person who made the statement, when that statement or confession is offered against the accused in a criminal case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment. The Conferees intend to include within the purview of this <!-- PDFPage:421 -->rule, statements subjecting a person to civil liability and statements rendering claims invalid. The Conferees agree to delete the provision regarding statements by a codefendant, thereby reflecting the general approach in the Rules of Evidence to avoid attempting to codify constitutional evidentiary principles.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment adds a new subsection, (b)(6) [now (b)(5)], which makes admissible a hearsay statement not specifically covered by any of the five previous subsections, if the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill eliminated a similar, but broader, provision because of the conviction that such a provision injected too much uncertainty into the law of evidence regarding hearsay and impaired the ability of a litigant to prepare adequately for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that renumbers this subsection and provides that a party intending to request the court to use a statement under this provision must notify any adverse party of this intention as well as of the particulars of the statement, including the name and address of the declarant. This notice must be given sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide any adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare the contest the use of the statement.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(5).</em> The contents of Rule 803(24) and Rule 804(b)(5) have been combined and transferred to a new Rule 807. This was done to facilitate additions to Rules 803 and 804. No change in meaning is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(6).</em> Rule 804(b)(6) has been added to provide that a party forfeits the right to object on hearsay grounds to the admission of a declarant's prior statement when the party's deliberate wrongdoing or acquiescence therein procured the unavailability of the declarant as a witness. This recognizes the need for a prophylactic rule to deal with abhorrent behavior &ldquo;which strikes at the heart of the system of justice itself.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Mastrangelo</em>, 693 F.2d 269, 273 (2d Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied</em>, 467 U.S. 1204 (1984). The wrongdoing need not consist of a criminal act. The rule applies to all parties, including the government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Every circuit that has resolved the question has recognized the principle of forfeiture by misconduct, although the tests for determining whether there is a forfeiture have varied. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Aguiar</em>, 975 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Potamitis</em>, 739 F.2d 784, 789 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 469 U.S. 918 (1984); <em>Steele v. Taylor</em>, 684 F.2d 1193, 1199 (6th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied</em>, 460 U.S. 1053 (1983); <em>United States v. Balano</em>, 618 F.2d 624, 629 (10th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied</em>, 449 U.S. 840 (1980); <em>United States v. Carlson</em>, 547 F.2d 1346, 1358&ndash;59 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 431 U.S. 914 (1977). The foregoing cases apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>Contra United States v. Thevis</em>, 665 F.2d 616, 631 (5th Cir.) (clear and convincing standard), <cap-smallcap>cert. denied</cap-smallcap>, 459 U.S. 825 (1982). The usual Rule 104(a) preponderance of the evidence standard has been adopted in light of the behavior the new Rule 804(b)(6) seeks to discourage.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 804(b)(5)</em>. The words &ldquo;Transferred to Rule 807&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;Abrogated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 804(b)(6)</em>. The title of the rule was changed to &ldquo;Forfeiture by wrongdoing.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 24 was changed to &ldquo;that&rdquo; to indicate that the rule is potentially applicable against the government. Two sentences were added to the first paragraph of the committee note to clarify that the wrongdoing need not be criminal in nature, and to indicate the rule's potential applicability to the government. The word &ldquo;forfeiture&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;waiver&rdquo; in the note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2010 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3).</em> Rule 804(b)(3) has been amended to provide that the corroborating circumstances requirement applies to all declarations against penal interest offered in criminal cases. A number of courts have applied the corroborating circumstances requirement to declarations against penal interest offered by the prosecution, even though the text of the Rule did not so provide. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez</em>, 584 F.2d 694, 701 (5th Cir. 1978) (&ldquo;by transplanting the language governing exculpatory statements onto the analysis for admitting inculpatory hearsay, a unitary standard is derived which offers the most workable basis for applying Rule 804(b)(3)&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Shukri</em>, 207 F.3d 412 (7th Cir. 2000) (requiring corroborating circumstances for against-penal-interest statements offered by the government). A unitary approach to declarations against penal interest assures both the prosecution and the accused that the Rule will not be abused and that only reliable hearsay statements will be admitted under the exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">All other changes to the structure and wording of the Rule are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any other result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment does not address the use of the corroborating circumstances for declarations against penal interest offered in civil cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In assessing whether corroborating circumstances exist, some courts have focused on the credibility of the witness who relates the hearsay statement in court. But the credibility of the witness who relates the statement is not a proper factor for the court to consider in assessing corroborating circumstances. To base admission or exclusion of a hearsay statement on the witness's credibility would usurp the jury's role of determining the credibility of testifying witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> The rule, as submitted for public comment, was restyled in accordance with the style conventions of the Style Subcommittee of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure. As restyled, the proposed amendment addresses the style suggestions made in public comments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed Committee Note was amended to add a short discussion on applying the corroborating circumstances requirement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body"><b>1988</b>&mdash;Subd. (a)(5). Pub. L. 100&ndash;690 substituted &ldquo;subdivision&rdquo; for &ldquo;subdivisions&rdquo;.</p>
