<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Claim for Relief.</cap-smallcap> A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court's jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the alternative or different types of relief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Defenses; Admissions and Denials.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> In responding to a pleading, a party must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted against it; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by an opposing party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Denials&mdash;Responding to the Substance.</em> A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>General and Specific Denials.</em> A party that intends in good faith to deny all the allegations of a pleading&mdash;including the jurisdictional grounds&mdash;may do so by a general denial. A party that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either specifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all except those specifically admitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Denying Part of an Allegation.</em> A party that intends in good faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that is true and deny the rest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:119 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Lacking Knowledge or Information.</em> A party that lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation must so state, and the statement has the effect of a denial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Effect of Failing to Deny.</em> An allegation&mdash;other than one relating to the amount of damages&mdash;is admitted if a responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative Defenses.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; accord and satisfaction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; arbitration and award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; assumption of risk;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; contributory negligence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; duress;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; estoppel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; failure of consideration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; fraud;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; illegality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; injury by fellow servant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; laches;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; license;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; payment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; release;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; res judicata;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; statute of frauds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; statute of limitations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">&bull; waiver.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Mistaken Designation.</em> If a party mistakenly designates a defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading as though it were correctly designated, and may impose terms for doing so.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Pleading to Be Concise and Direct; Alternative Statements; Inconsistency.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> Each allegation must be simple, concise, and direct. No technical form is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Alternative Statements of a Claim or Defense.</em> A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Inconsistent Claims or Defenses.</em> A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Construing Pleadings.</cap-smallcap> Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. See [former] Equity Rules 25 (Bill of Complaint&mdash;Contents), and 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim). Compare 2 Ind.Stat.Ann. (Burns, 1933) &sect;&sect;2&ndash;1004, 2&ndash;1015; 2 Ohio Gen.Code Ann. (Page, 1926) &sect;&sect;11305, 11314; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933), &sect;&sect;104&ndash;7&ndash;2, 104&ndash;9&ndash;1.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 19(c) for the requirement of a statement in a claim for relief of the names of persons who ought to be parties and the reason for their omission.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 23(b) for particular requirements as to the complaint in a secondary action by shareholders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. 1. This rule supersedes the methods of pleading prescribed in U.S.C., Title 19, &sect;508 (Persons making seizures pleading general issue and providing special matter); U.S.C., Title 35, [former] &sect;&sect;40d (Providing under general issue, upon notice, that a statement in application for an extended patent is not true), 69 [now 282] (Pleading and proof in actions for infringement) and similar statutes.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This rule is, in part, [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), with the matter on denials largely from the Connecticut practice. See Conn.Practice Book (1934) &sect;&sect;107, 108, and 122; Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930) &sect;&sect;5508&ndash;5514. Compare the English practice, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 17&ndash;20.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c)</em>. This follows substantially English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r. 15 and N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;242, with &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; omitted in this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. The first sentence is similar to [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim). For the second sentence see [former] Equity Rule 31 (Reply&mdash;When Required&mdash;When Cause at Issue). This is similar to English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 19, r.r. 13, 18; and to the practice in the States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e)</em>. This rule is an elaboration upon [former] Equity Rule 30 (Answer&mdash;Contents&mdash;Counterclaim), plus a statement of the actual practice under some codes. Compare also [former] Equity Rule 18 (Pleadings&mdash;Technical Forms Abrogated). See Clark, Code Pleading (1928), pp. 171&ndash;4, 432&ndash;5; Hankin, <em>Alternative and Hypothetical Pleading</em> (1924), 33 Yale L.J. 365.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (f)</em>. A provision of like import is of frequent occurrence in the codes. Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;157(3); 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9266; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;275; 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7458.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change here is consistent with the broad purposes of unification.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 8 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former Rule 8(b) and 8(e) cross-references to Rule 11 are deleted as redundant. Rule 11 applies by its own terms. The force and application of Rule 11 are not diminished by the deletion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 8(b) required a pleader denying part of an averment to &ldquo;specify so much of it as is true and material and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* deny only the remainder.&rdquo; &ldquo;[A]nd material&rdquo; is deleted to avoid the implication that it is proper to deny something that the pleader believes to be true but not material.</p>
<p class="note-body">Deletion of former Rule 8(e)(2)'s &ldquo;whether based on legal, equitable, or maritime grounds&rdquo; reflects the parallel deletions in Rule 1 and elsewhere. Merger is now successfully accomplished.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. See Note to Rule 1, supra.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2010 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(1)</em>. &ldquo;[D]ischarge in bankruptcy&rdquo; is deleted from the list of affirmative defenses. Under 11 U.S.C. &sect;524(a)(1) and (2) a discharge voids a judgment to the extent that it determines a personal liability of the debtor with respect to a discharged debt. The discharge <!-- PDFPage:120 -->also operates as an injunction against commencement or continuation of an action to collect, recover, or offset a discharged debt. For these reasons it is confusing to describe discharge as an affirmative defense. But &sect;524(a) applies only to a claim that was actually discharged. Several categories of debt set out in 11 U.S.C. &sect;523(a) are excepted from discharge. The issue whether a claim was excepted from discharge may be determined either in the court that entered the discharge or&mdash;in most instances&mdash;in another court with jurisdiction over the creditor's claim.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. No changes were made in the rule text.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee Note was revised to delete statements that were over-simplified. New material was added to provide a reminder of the means to determine whether a debt was in fact discharged.</p>
