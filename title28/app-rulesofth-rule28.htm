<h3 class="section-head">Rule 28. Oral Argument</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. Oral argument should emphasize and clarify the written arguments in the briefs on the merits. Counsel should assume that all Justices have read the briefs before oral argument. Oral argument read from a prepared text is not favored.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. The petitioner or appellant shall open and may conclude the argument. A cross-writ of certiorari or cross-appeal will be argued with the initial writ of certiorari or appeal as one case in the time allowed for that one case, and the Court will advise the parties who shall open and close.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. Unless the Court directs otherwise, each side is allowed one-half hour for argument. Counsel is not required to use all the allotted time. Any request for additional time to argue shall be presented by motion under Rule 21 no more than 15 days after the petitioner's or appellant's brief on the merits is filed, and shall set out specifically and concisely why the case cannot be presented within the half-hour limitation. Additional time is rarely accorded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. Only one attorney will be heard for each side, except by leave of the Court on motion filed no more than 15 days after the respondent's or appellee's brief on the merits is filed. Any request for divided argument shall be presented by motion under Rule 21 and shall set out specifically and concisely why more than one attorney should be allowed to argue. Divided argument is not favored.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. Regardless of the number of counsel participating in oral argument, counsel making the opening argument shall present the case fairly and completely and not reserve points of substance for rebuttal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. Oral argument will not be allowed on behalf of any party for whom a brief has not been filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">7. By leave of the Court, and subject to paragraph 4 of this Rule, counsel for an <em>amicus curiae</em> whose brief has been filed as provided in Rule 37 may argue orally on the side of a party, with the consent of that party. In the absence of consent, counsel for an <em>amicus curiae</em> may seek leave of the Court to argue orally by a motion setting out specifically and concisely why oral argument would provide assistance to the Court not otherwise available. Such a motion will be <!-- PDFPage:392 -->granted only in the most extraordinary circumstances.</p>
