<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Filing and Fee.</strong> When the transfer of a case from another court to this court is permitted by law, including compliance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(d)(4)(B), the case shall be filed in this court upon the receipt by the clerk of a certified copy of the record made in the other court, including the order of that court granting the transfer. The clerk shall serve a notice of this filing on the parties as provided in RCFC 5. Where all required fees in the other court are shown to have been paid, no filing fee will be required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Complaint; Copies.</strong> Eight copies of the complaint filed in the other court, containing the necessary changes in the caption and duplicated in conformity with RCFC 5.3, shall be filed with the clerk within 28 days after the filing required in subdivision (a)(1). In lieu thereof and within the same time period, an original and 7 copies of an amended complaint may be filed in conformity with the rules of this court setting forth the claim or claims transferred. Service shall be made on the United States as provided in RCFC 4.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Procedure.</strong> After the filing and service as provided for in subdivision (a)(2), all further proceedings shall be in accordance with the rules prescribed for cases filed in this court in the first instance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Referral of Cases by the Comptroller General.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Service of Notice; Time for Response.</strong> Upon the filing of a case referred to the court by the Comptroller General, the clerk shall serve a notice, as provided in RCFC 5, on each person whose name and address are shown by the papers transmitted and who appears to be interested in the subject matter of the reference, which notice shall set forth the filing of the reference and state that the person notified appears to have an interest therein and that such person shall have 90 days after such service within which to appear and assert such person's claim by filing a complaint. At the same time, the clerk shall forward a copy of each such notice to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Procedure After Notice.</strong> After the service of notice upon the interested person or persons, all further proceedings for the disposition of the case shall be in accordance with the rules prescribed herein for other cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Failure of Party to Appear.</strong> If no interested plaintiff appears to file a complaint within the time specified in the notice served by the clerk, the case shall be submitted to the court upon the papers filed and upon such evidence, if any, as may be produced by the Attorney General.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 3.1 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 84. The renumbering of RCFC 84 is intended to reflect its more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules.</p>
