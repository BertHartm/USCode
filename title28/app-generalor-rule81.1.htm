<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Appearance. (1) <em>Entry of Appearance on Written Consent of Party</em></strong>. Subject to the provisions of this rule, an eligible law student may enter an appearance in this court on behalf of any party provided the party on whose behalf the student appears has consented thereto in writing and a &ldquo;supervising attorney,&rdquo; as defined in this rule, has also indicated approval of that appearance in writing. In each case, the written consent and approval shall be filed with the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Activities. (1) <em>Appearance on Briefs and Other Written Pleadings, Participation in Oral Argument and Other Activities</em></strong>. A law student who has entered an appearance in a case pursuant to paragraph (a) may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(A)</strong> Appear on the brief(s) and other written pleadings, provided the supervising attorney has read, approved, and co-signed the brief(s);</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> Participate in all proceedings ordered by a judge or special master provided the supervising attorney is present at such proceedings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> Engage in all other activities on behalf of the client in all ways that a licensed attorney may, subject to the general direction of the supervising attorney. However, a student may make no binding commitments on behalf of a client absent prior approval of both the client and the supervising attorney. In any matter in which testimony is taken, including depositions, the student must be accompanied by the supervising attorney. Documents or papers filed with the court must be read, approved, and co-signed by the supervising attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Limitations on Activities</em></strong>. The court retains the authority to establish exceptions to the activities in paragraph (1), and also to limit a student's participation in any individual case.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(7)</strong> Neither ask for nor receive any fee or compensation of any kind from the client on whose behalf service is rendered. However, this rule shall not prevent a lawyer, legal aid bureau, law school, or the Government from paying compensation to the eligible law student, nor shall it prevent any of them from making such charges for its services as may otherwise be proper, nor shall it prevent any clinical program <!-- PDFPage:394 -->from receiving otherwise proper fees and expenses under rule 81(e).</p>
