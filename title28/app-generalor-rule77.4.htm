<h3 class="section-head">Rule 77.4. Taxation of Costs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Filing Bill of Costs.</strong> A prevailing party may request the clerk to tax allowable costs by filing a Bill of Costs as set forth in Appendix I within 30 days after the date of the entry of judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Objections to Bill of Costs. (1)</strong> An adverse party may object to the Bill of Costs or any item claimed therein by filing objections within 14 days after the service of the Bill of Costs. Within 7 days after service of the objections, the prevailing party may file a reply. Unless a conference is scheduled by the clerk, the taxation of costs or any disallowance will be made by the clerk on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> A party may request the court to review the clerk's action by filing a motion within 5 days after action by the clerk. The court's review of the clerk's action will be made on the existing record unless otherwise ordered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Costs in Settlements.</strong> The clerk will not tax costs on any action terminated by settlement wherein the judgment is entered pursuant to Rule 68 or is dismissed pursuant to Rule 41(a). Settlement agreements must resolve any issue relating to costs. In the absence of special agreement, parties will bear their own costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) No Extensions.</strong> No extensions of time under this rule will be permitted and the failure of a prevailing party to timely file a Bill of Costs shall constitute a waiver of any claim for costs.</p>
