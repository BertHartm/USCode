If such action or proceeding is against debtors who are husband and wife, one debtor may not elect to exempt property listed in paragraph (1) and the other debtor elect to exempt property listed in paragraph (2). If the debtors cannot agree on the alternative to be elected, they shall be deemed to elect paragraph (1). Such property is either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) property that is specified in section 522(d) of title 11, as amended from time to time; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) any property that is exempt under Federal law, other than paragraph (1), or State or local law that is applicable on the date of the filing of the application for a remedy under this chapter at the place in which the debtor's domicile has been located for the 180 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of such application, or for a longer portion of such 180-day period than in any other place; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any interest in property in which the debtor had, immediately before the filing of such application, an interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant, or an interest in a community estate, to the extent that such interest is exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Effect on Assertion and Manner of Determination.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Statement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A court may order the debtor to file a statement with regard to any claimed exemption. A copy of such statement shall be served on counsel for the United States. Such statement shall be under oath and shall describe each item of property for which exemption is claimed, the value and the basis for such valuation, and the nature of the debtor's ownership interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States or the debtor, by application to the court in which an action or proceeding under this chapter is pending, may request a hearing on the applicability of any exemption claimed by the debtor.

The United States may not take possession of, dispose of, sell, or otherwise interfere with the debtor's normal use and enjoyment of an interest in property the United States knows or has reason to know is exempt.</p>
