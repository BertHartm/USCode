<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This appendix sets forth the procedures applicable to the court's procurement protest jurisdiction. In the main, these procedures reflect those that formerly appeared as General Order No. 38, issued on May 7, 1998. In addition, however, Appendix C now also incorporates&mdash;in paragraphs 10 through 14&mdash;those provisions of former RCFC 65(f) (titled &ldquo;Procedures&rdquo;) which enumerated requirements particular to applications for temporary restraining orders and/or motions for preliminary injunction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Papers and exhibits are often filed under seal in procurement protests. Procedures for unsealing are addressed at RCFC 77.3(d). The standards for granting access to protected information are addressed in decisions such as <em>U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States</em>, 730 F.2d 1465 (Fed. Cir. 1984) and <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States</em>, 929 F.2d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
