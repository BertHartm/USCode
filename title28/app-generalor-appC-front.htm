<p class="note-body">This appendix sets forth the procedures applicable to the court's procurement protest jurisdiction. In the <!-- PDFPage:471 -->main, these procedures reflect those that formerly appeared as General Order No. 38, issued on May 7, 1998. In addition, however, Appendix C now also incorporates&mdash;in paragraphs 10 through 14&mdash;those provisions of former RCFC 65(f) (titled &ldquo;Procedures&rdquo;) which enumerated requirements particular to applications for temporary restraining orders and/or motions for preliminary injunction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Papers and exhibits are often filed under seal in procurement protests. Procedures for unsealing are addressed at RCFC 77.3(d). The standards for granting access to protected information are addressed in decisions such as <em>U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States</em>, 730 F.2d 1465 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States</em>, 929 F.2d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs 16(a) and 20 of this appendix address the disposition of material containing protected information after a case has been concluded. Both paragraphs contemplate that a protective order entered in a case involving protected information will set out the obligations of the parties in this regard. Form 8 in the Appendix of Forms, the sample protective order suggested for use in procurement protest cases, has been modified to include a new paragraph 8 which concerns the court's retention and disposition of protected materials filed by the parties. The new paragraph provides that the original version of the administrative record and any other ancillary materials filed under seal in such a case will be retained by the court pursuant to RCFC 77.3(d). Copies of such materials filed with the court in addition to the original version may be returned by the court to the parties for appropriate disposition. In a particular case, the parties may propose to the court that other provisions be substituted for this portion of the model protective order.</p>
