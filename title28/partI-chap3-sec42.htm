<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;215 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;119, 36 Stat. 1131; Dec. 23, 1944, ch. 724, 58 Stat. 925).</p>
<p class="note-body">The authority of the Chief Justice in vacation to assign a circuit justice to more than one circuit was extended by omitting the phrase &ldquo;whenever by reason of death or resignation, no Justice is allotted to a circuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in section 215 of Title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that, for the purposes of said section, the &ldquo;District of Columbia shall be deemed to be a judicial circuit,&rdquo; was omitted, since the District of Columbia is made a judicial circuit by section 41 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last paragraph was added to make clear the intent of Congress that the powers of the Court to assign the justices among the several circuits should be completely flexible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
