<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Form and Contents.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Requirements&mdash;In General.</em> Every subpoena must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) state the court from which it issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) state the title of the action, the court in which it is pending, and its civil-action number;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) command each person to whom it is directed to do the following at a specified time and place: attend and testify; produce designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person's possession, custody, or control; or permit the inspection of premises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) set out the text of Rule 45(c) and (d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Command to Attend a Deposition&mdash;Notice of the Recording Method.</em> A subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition must state the method for recording the testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Combining or Separating a Command to Produce or to Permit Inspection; Specifying the Form for Electronically Stored Information.</em> A command to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or to permit the inspection of premises may be included in a subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or may be set out in a separate subpoena. A subpoena may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Command to Produce; Included Obligations.</em> A command in a subpoena to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things requires the responding party to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Issued from Which Court.</em> A subpoena must issue as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for attendance at a hearing or trial, from the court for the district where the hearing or trial is to be held;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for attendance at a deposition, from the court for the district where the deposition is to be taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for production or inspection, if separate from a subpoena commanding a person's attendance, from the court for the district where the production or inspection is to be made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Issued by Whom.</em> The clerk must issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party who requests it. That party must complete it before service. An attorney also may issue and sign a subpoena as an officer of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a court in which the attorney is authorized to practice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a court for a district where a deposition is to be taken or production is to be made, if the attorney is authorized to practice in the court where the action is pending.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Service.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>By Whom; Tendering Fees; Serving a Copy of Certain Subpoenas.</em> Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a subpoena. Serving a subpoena requires delivering a copy to the named person and, if the subpoena requires that person's attendance, tendering the fees for 1 day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees and mileage need not be tendered when the subpoena issues on behalf of the United States or any of its officers or agencies. If the subpoena commands the production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or the inspection of premises before trial, then before it is served, a notice must be served on each party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Service in the United States.</em> Subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii), a subpoena may be served at any place:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) within the district of the issuing court;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:225 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) outside that district but within 100 miles of the place specified for the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) within the state of the issuing court if a state statute or court rule allows service at that place of a subpoena issued by a state court of general jurisdiction sitting in the place specified for the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) that the court authorizes on motion and for good cause, if a federal statute so provides.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Service in a Foreign Country.</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783 governs issuing and serving a subpoena directed to a United States national or resident who is in a foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Proof of Service.</em> Proving service, when necessary, requires filing with the issuing court a statement showing the date and manner of service and the names of the persons served. The statement must be certified by the server.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions.</em> A party or attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena. The issuing court must enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction&mdash;which may include lost earnings and reasonable attorney's fees&mdash;on a party or attorney who fails to comply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Appearance Not Required.</em> A person commanded to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition, hearing, or trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Objections.</em> A person commanded to produce documents or tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises&mdash;or to producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party may move the issuing court for an order compelling production or inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer from significant expense resulting from compliance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>When Required.</em> On timely motion, the issuing court must quash or modify a subpoena that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) requires a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to travel more than 100 miles from where that person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person&mdash;except that, subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(B)(iii), the person may be commanded to attend a trial by traveling from any such place within the state where the trial is held;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) subjects a person to undue burden.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>When Permitted.</em> To protect a person subject to or affected by a subpoena, the issuing court may, on motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert's study that was not requested by a party; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Specifying Conditions as an Alternative.</em> In the circumstances described in Rule 45(c)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified conditions if the serving party:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Duties in Responding to a Subpoena.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information.</em> These procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Documents.</em> A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified.</em> If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form.</em> The person responding need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information.</em> The person responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel <!-- PDFPage:226 -->discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Claiming Privilege or Protection.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Information Withheld.</em> A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) expressly make the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Information Produced.</em> If information produced in response to a subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The person who produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Contempt.</cap-smallcap> The issuing court may hold in contempt a person who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena. A nonparty's failure to obey must be excused if the subpoena purports to require the nonparty to attend or produce at a place outside the limits of Rule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule applies to subpoenas <em>ad testificandum</em> and <em>duces tecum</em> issued by the district courts for attendance at a hearing or a trial, or to take depositions. It does not apply to the enforcement of subpoenas issued by administrative officers and commissions pursuant to statutory authority. The enforcement of such subpoenas by the district courts is regulated by appropriate statutes. Many of these statutes do not place any territorial limits on the validity of subpoenas so issued, but provide that they may be served anywhere within the United States. Among such statutes are the following:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 7, &sect;&sect;222 and 511n (Secretary of Agriculture)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 15, &sect;49 (Federal Trade Commission)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 15, &sect;&sect;77v(b), 78u(c), 79r(d) (Securities and Exchange Commission)</p>

<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 47, &sect;409(c) and (d) (Federal Communications Commission)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 49, &sect;12(2) and (3) [see 721(c) and 13301(c)] (Interstate Commerce Commission)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 49, &sect;173a [see 46104] (Secretary of Commerce)</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em>. These simplify the form of subpoena as provided in U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;655 (Witnesses; subpoena; form; attendance under); and broaden U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;636 (Production of books and writings) to include all actions, and to extend to any person. With the provision for relief from an oppressive or unreasonable subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>, compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;411.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c)</em>. This provides for the simple and convenient method of service permitted under many state codes; e.g., N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;220, 404, J.Ct.Act, &sect;191; 3 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;1218. Compare Equity Rule 15 (Process, by Whom Served).</p>
<p class="note-body">For statutes governing fees and mileage of witnesses see:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 28:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;600a [now 1871] (Per diem; mileage)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;600c [now 1821, 1825] (Amount per diem and mileage for witnesses; subsistence)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;600d [former] (Fees and mileage in certain states)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;601 [former] (Witnesses; fees; enumeration)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;602 [now 1824] (Fees and mileage of jurors and witnesses)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;603 [see Title 5, &sect;&sect;5515, 5537] (No officer of court to have witness fees)</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. The method provided in paragraph (1) for the authorization of the issuance of subpoenas has been employed in some districts. See <em>Henning v. Boyle</em>, 112 Fed. 397 (S.D.N.Y., 1901). The requirement of an order for the issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> is in accordance with U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;647 (Deposition under <em>dedimus potestatem;</em> subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>). The provisions of paragraph (2) are in accordance with common practice. See U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;648 (Deposition under <em>dedimus potestatem;</em> witnesses, when required to attend); N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;300; 1 N.J.Rev.Stat. (1937) 2:27&ndash;174.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e)</em>. The first paragraph continues the substance of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;654 (Witnesses; subpoenas; may run into another district). Compare U.S.C., Title 11, [former] &sect;69 (Referees in bankruptcy; contempts before) (production of books and writings) which is not affected by this rule. For examples of statutes which allow the court, upon proper application and cause shown, to authorize the clerk of the court to issue a subpoena for a witness who lives in another district and at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of the hearing or trial, see:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 15:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;23 (Suits by United States; subpoenas for witnesses) (under antitrust laws).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:227 --><p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 38:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph continues the present procedure applicable to certain witnesses who are in foreign countries. See U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;&sect;711 [now 1783] (Letters rogatory to take testimony of witness, addressed to court of foreign country; failure of witness to appear; subpoena) and 713 [now 1783] (Service of subpoena on witness in foreign country).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (f)</em>. Compare [former] Equity Rule 52 (Attendance of Witnesses Before Commissioner, Master, or Examiner).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The added words, &ldquo;or tangible things&rdquo; in subdivision (b) merely make the rule for the subpoena duces tecum at the trial conform to that of subdivision (d) for the subpoena at the taking of depositions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The insertion of the words &ldquo;or modify&rdquo; in clause (1) affords desirable flexibility.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The added last sentence of amended subdivision (d)(1) properly gives the subpoena for documents or tangible things the same scope as provided in Rule 26(b), thus promoting uniformity. The requirement in the last sentence of original Rule 45(d)(1)&mdash;to the effect that leave of court should be obtained for the issuance of such a subpoena&mdash;has been omitted. This requirement is unnecessary and oppressive on both counsel and court, and it has been criticized by district judges. There is no satisfactory reason for a differentiation between a subpoena for the production of documentary evidence by a witness at a trial (Rule 45(a)) and for the production of the same evidence at the taking of a deposition. Under this amendment, the person subpoenaed may obtain the protection afforded by any of the orders permitted under Rule 30(b) or Rule 45(b). See <em>Application of Zenith Radio Corp</em>. (E.D.Pa. 1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 30b.21, Case 1, 1 F.R.D. 627; <em>Fox v. House</em> (E.D.Okla. 1939) 29 F.Supp. 673; <em>United States of America for the Use of Tilo Roofing Co., Inc. v. J. Slotnik Co</em>. (D.Conn. 1944) 3 F.R.D. 408.</p>
<p class="note-body">The changes in subdivision (d)(2) give the court the same power in the case of residents of the district as is conferred in the case of non-residents, and permit the court to fix a place for attendance which may be more convenient and accessible for the parties than that specified in the rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">At present, when a subpoena duces tecum is issued to a deponent, he is required to produce the listed materials at the deposition, but is under no clear compulsion to permit their inspection and copying. This results in confusion and uncertainty before the time the deposition is taken, with no mechanism provided whereby the court can resolve the matter. Rule 45(d)(1), as revised, makes clear that the subpoena authorizes inspection and copying of the materials produced. The deponent is afforded full protection since he can object, thereby forcing the party serving the subpoena to obtain a court order if he wishes to inspect and copy. The procedure is thus analogous to that provided in Rule 34.</p>
<p class="note-body">The changed references to other rules conform to changes made in those rules. The deletion of words in the clause describing the proper scope of the subpoena conforms to a change made in the language of Rule 34. The reference to Rule 26(b) is unchanged but encompasses new matter in that subdivision. The changes make it clear that the scope of discovery through a subpoena is the same as that applicable to Rule 34 and the other discovery rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1980 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(1)</em>. The amendment defines the term &ldquo;proof of service&rdquo; as used in the first sentence of the present subdivision. For want of a definition, the district court clerks have been obliged to fashion their own, with results that vary from district to district. All that seems required is a simple certification on a copy of the notice to take a deposition that the notice has been served on every other party to the action. That is the proof of service required by Rule 25(d) of both the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Supreme Court Rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)(1)</em>. The amendment makes the reach of a subpoena of a district court at least as extensive as that of the state courts of general jurisdiction in the state in which the district court is held. Under the present rule the reach of a district court subpoena is often greater, since it extends throughout the district. No reason appears why it should be less, as it sometimes is because of the accident of district lines. Restrictions upon the reach of subpoenas are imposed to prevent undue inconvenience to witnesses. State statutes and rules of court are quite likely to reflect the varying degrees of difficulty and expense attendant upon local travel.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Present Rule 45(d)(2) has two sentences setting forth the territorial scope of deposition subpoenas. The first sentence is directed to depositions taken in the judicial district in which the deponent resides; the second sentence addresses situations in which the deponent is not a resident of the district in which the deposition is to take place. The Rule, as currently constituted, creates anomalous situations that often cause logistical problems in conducting litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of the present Rule states that a deponent may be required to attend only in the <em>county</em> wherein that person resides or is employed or transacts business in person, that is, where the person lives or works. Under this provision a deponent can be compelled, without court order, to travel from one end of that person's home county to the other, no matter how far that may be. The second sentence of the Rule is somewhat more flexible, stating that someone who does not reside in the district in which the deposition is to be taken can be required to attend in the county where the person is served with the subpoena, <em>or</em> within 40 miles from the place of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under today's conditions there is no sound reason for distinguishing between residents of the district or county in which a deposition is to be taken and nonresidents, and the Rule is amended to provide that any person may be subpoenaed to attend a deposition within a specified radius from that person's residence, place of business, or where the person was served. The 40-mile radius has been increased to 100 miles.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Purposes of Revision. The purposes of this revision are (1) to clarify and enlarge the protections afforded persons who are required to assist the court by giving information or evidence; (2) to facilitate access outside the deposition procedure provided by Rule 30 to documents and other information in the possession of persons who are not parties; (3) to facilitate service of subpoenas for depositions or productions of evidence at <!-- PDFPage:228 -->places distant from the district in which an action is proceeding; (4) to enable the court to compel a witness found within the state in which the court sits to attend trial; (5) to clarify the organization of the text of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision is amended in seven significant respects.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, Paragraph (a)(3) modifies the requirement that a subpoena be issued by the clerk of court. Provision is made for the issuance of subpoenas by attorneys as officers of the court. This revision perhaps culminates an evolution. Subpoenas were long issued by specific order of the court. As this became a burden to the court, general orders were made authorizing clerks to issue subpoenas on request. Since 1948, they have been issued in blank by the clerk of any federal court to any lawyer, the clerk serving as stationer to the bar. In allowing counsel to issue the subpoena, the rule is merely a recognition of present reality.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the subpoena is in a sense the command of the attorney who completes the form, defiance of a subpoena is nevertheless an act in defiance of a court order and exposes the defiant witness to contempt sanctions. In <em>ICC v. Brimson</em>, 154 U.S. 447 (1894), the Court upheld a statute directing federal courts to issue subpoenas to compel testimony before the ICC. In <em>CAB v. Hermann</em>, 353 U.S. 322 (1957), the Court approved as established practice the issuance of administrative subpoenas as a matter of absolute agency right. And in <em>NLRB v. Warren Co</em>., 350 U.S. 107 (1955), the Court held that the lower court had no discretion to withhold sanctions against a contemnor who violated such subpoenas. The 1948 revision of Rule 45 put the attorney in a position similar to that of the administrative agency, as a public officer entitled to use the court's contempt power to investigate facts in dispute. Two courts of appeals have touched on the issue and have described lawyer-issued subpoenas as mandates of the court. <em>Waste Conversion, Inc. v. Rollins Environmental Services (NJ), Inc</em>., 893 F.2d 605 (3d cir., 1990); <em>Fisher v. Marubent Cotton Corp</em>., 526 F.2d 1338, 1340 (8th cir., 1975). Cf. <em>Young v. United States ex rel Vuitton et Fils S.A</em>., 481 U.S. 787, 821 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring). This revision makes the rule explicit that the attorney acts as an officer of the court in issuing and signing subpoenas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Necessarily accompanying the evolution of this power of the lawyer as officer of the court is the development of increased responsibility and liability for the misuse of this power. The latter development is reflected in the provisions of subdivision (c) of this rule, and also in the requirement imposed by paragraph (3) of this subdivision that the attorney issuing a subpoena must sign it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, Paragraph (a)(3) authorizes attorneys in distant districts to serve as officers authorized to issue commands in the name of the court. Any attorney permitted to represent a client in a federal court, even one admitted pro hac vice, has the same authority as a clerk to issue a subpoena from any federal court for the district in which the subpoena is served and enforced. In authorizing attorneys to issue subpoenas from distant courts, the amended rule effectively authorizes service of a subpoena anywhere in the United States by an attorney representing any party. This change is intended to ease the administrative burdens of inter-district law practice. The former rule resulted in delay and expense caused by the need to secure forms from clerks&rsquo; offices some distance from the place at which the action proceeds. This change does not enlarge the burden on the witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to Paragraph (a)(2), a subpoena for a deposition must still issue from the court in which the deposition or production would be compelled. Accordingly, a motion to quash such a subpoena if it overbears the limits of the subpoena power must, as under the previous rule, be presented to the court for the district in which the deposition would occur. Likewise, the court in whose name the subpoena is issued is responsible for its enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, in order to relieve attorneys of the need to secure an appropriate seal to affix to a subpoena issued as an officer of a distant court, the requirement that a subpoena be under seal is abolished by the provisions of Paragraph (a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, Paragraph (a)(1) authorizes the issuance of a subpoena to compel a non-party to produce evidence independent of any deposition. This revision spares the necessity of a deposition of the custodian of evidentiary material required to be produced. A party seeking additional production from a person subject to such a subpoena may serve an additional subpoena requiring additional production at the same time and place.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fifth, Paragraph (a)(2) makes clear that the person subject to the subpoena is required to produce materials in that person's control whether or not the materials are located within the district or within the territory within which the subpoena can be served. The non-party witness is subject to the same scope of discovery under this rule as that person would be as a party to whom a request is addressed pursuant to Rule 34.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sixth, Paragraph (a)(1) requires that the subpoena include a statement of the rights and duties of witnesses by setting forth in full the text of the new subdivisions (c) and (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Seventh, the revised rule authorizes the issuance of a subpoena to compel the inspection of premises in the possession of a non-party. Rule 34 has authorized such inspections of premises in the possession of a party as discovery compelled under Rule 37, but prior practice required an independent proceeding to secure such relief ancillary to the federal proceeding when the premises were not in the possession of a party. Practice in some states has long authorized such use of a subpoena for this purpose without apparent adverse consequence.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Paragraph (b)(1) retains the text of the former subdivision (c) with minor changes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to the United States marshal and deputy marshal is deleted because of the infrequency of the use of these officers for this purpose. Inasmuch as these officers meet the age requirement, they may still be used if available.</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision requiring service of prior notice pursuant to Rule 5 of compulsory pretrial production or inspection has been added to paragraph (b)(1). The purpose of such notice is to afford other parties an opportunity to object to the production or inspection, or to serve a demand for additional documents or things. Such additional notice is not needed with respect to a deposition because of the requirement of notice imposed by Rule 30 or 31. But when production or inspection is sought independently of a deposition, other parties may need notice in order to monitor the discovery and in order to pursue access to any information that may or should be produced.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (b)(2) retains language formerly set forth in subdivision (e) and extends its application to subpoenas for depositions or production.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (b)(3) retains language formerly set forth in paragraph (d)(1) and extends its applications to subpoenas for trial or hearing or production.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This provision is new and states the rights of witnesses. It is not intended to diminish rights conferred by Rules 26&ndash;37 or any other authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (c)(1) gives specific application to the principle stated in Rule 26(g) and specifies liability for earnings lost by a non-party witness as a result of a misuse of the subpoena. No change in existing law is thereby effected. Abuse of a subpoena is an actionable tort, <em>Board of Ed. v. Farmingdale Classroom Teach. Ass'n</em>, 38 N.Y.2d 397, 380 N.Y.S.2d 635, 343 N.E.2d 278 (1975), and the duty of the attorney to the non-party is also embodied in Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.4. The liability of the attorney is correlative to the expanded power of the attorney to issue subpoenas. The liability may include the cost of fees to collect attorneys&rsquo; fees owed as a result of a breach of this duty.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (c)(2) retains language from the former subdivision (b) and paragraph (d)(1). The 10-day period for response to a subpoena is extended to 14 days to avoid the complex calculations associated with short <!-- PDFPage:229 -->time periods under Rule 6 and to allow a bit more time for such objections to be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">A non-party required to produce documents or materials is protected against significant expense resulting from involuntary assistance to the court. This provision applies, for example, to a non-party required to provide a list of class members. The court is not required to fix the costs in advance of production, although this will often be the most satisfactory accommodation to protect the party seeking discovery from excessive costs. In some instances, it may be preferable to leave uncertain costs to be determined after the materials have been produced, provided that the risk of uncertainty is fully disclosed to the discovering party. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems, Inc</em>., 666 F.2d 364 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (c)(3) explicitly authorizes the quashing of a subpoena as a means of protecting a witness from misuse of the subpoena power. It replaces and enlarges on the former subdivision (b) of this rule and tracks the provisions of Rule 26(c). While largely repetitious, this rule is addressed to the witness who may read it on the subpoena, where it is required to be printed by the revised paragraph (a)(1) of this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(3)(A) identifies those circumstances in which a subpoena must be quashed or modified. It restates the former provisions with respect to the limits of mandatory travel that are set forth in the former paragraphs (d)(2) and (e)(1), with one important change. Under the revised rule, a federal court can compel a witness to come from any place in the state to attend trial, whether or not the local state law so provides. This extension is subject to the qualification provided in the next paragraph, which authorizes the court to condition enforcement of a subpoena compelling a non-party witness to bear substantial expense to attend trial. The traveling non-party witness may be entitled to reasonable compensation for the time and effort entailed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(A)(iv) requires the court to protect all persons from undue burden imposed by the use of the subpoena power. Illustratively, it might be unduly burdensome to compel an adversary to attend trial as a witness if the adversary is known to have no personal knowledge of matters in dispute, especially so if the adversary would be required to incur substantial travel burdens.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(3)(B) identifies circumstances in which a subpoena should be quashed unless the party serving the subpoena shows a substantial need and the court can devise an appropriate accommodation to protect the interests of the witness. An additional circumstance in which such action is required is a request for costly production of documents; that situation is expressly governed by subparagraph (b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(B)(i) authorizes the court to quash, modify, or condition a subpoena to protect the person subject to or affected by the subpoena from unnecessary or unduly harmful disclosures of confidential information. It corresponds to Rule 26(c)(7).</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(B)(ii) provides appropriate protection for the intellectual property of the non-party witness; it does not apply to the expert retained by a party, whose information is subject to the provisions of Rule 26(b)(4). A growing problem has been the use of subpoenas to compel the giving of evidence and information by unretained experts. Experts are not exempt from the duty to give evidence, even if they cannot be compelled to prepare themselves to give effective testimony, <em>e.g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Otte</em>, 474 F.2d 529 (2d Cir. 1972), but compulsion to give evidence may threaten the intellectual property of experts denied the opportunity to bargain for the value of their services. See generally Maurer, <em>Compelling the Expert Witness: Fairness and Utility Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, 19 GA.L.REV. 71 (1984); Note, <em>Discovery and Testimony of Unretained Experts</em>, 1987 DUKE L.J. 140. Arguably the compulsion to testify can be regarded as a &ldquo;taking&rdquo; of intellectual property. The rule establishes the right of such persons to withhold their expertise, at least unless the party seeking it makes the kind of showing required for a conditional denial of a motion to quash as provided in the final sentence of subparagraph (c)(3)(B); that requirement is the same as that necessary to secure work product under Rule 26(b)(3) and gives assurance of reasonable compensation. The Rule thus approves the accommodation of competing interests exemplified in <em>United States v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems Inc</em>., 666 F.2d 364 (9th Cir. 1982). See also <em>Wright v. Jeep Corporation</em>, 547 F. Supp. 871 (E.D. Mich. 1982).</p>
<p class="note-body">As stated in <em>Kaufman v. Edelstein</em>, 539 F.2d 811, 822 (2d Cir. 1976), the district court's discretion in these matters should be informed by &ldquo;the degree to which the expert is being called because of his knowledge of facts relevant to the case rather than in order to give opinion testimony; the difference between testifying to a previously formed or expressed opinion and forming a new one; the possibility that, for other reasons, the witness is a unique expert; the extent to which the calling party is able to show the unlikelihood that any comparable witness will willingly testify; and the degree to which the witness is able to show that he has been oppressed by having continually to testify.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(B)(iii) protects non-party witnesses who may be burdened to perform the duty to travel in order to provide testimony at trial. The provision requires the court to condition a subpoena requiring travel of more than 100 miles on reasonable compensation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This provision is new. Paragraph (d)(1) extends to non-parties the duty imposed on parties by the last paragraph of Rule 34(b), which was added in 1980.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (d)(2) is new and corresponds to the new Rule 26(b)(5). Its purpose is to provide a party whose discovery is constrained by a claim of privilege or work product protection with information sufficient to evaluate such a claim and to resist if it seems unjustified. The person claiming a privilege or protection cannot decide the limits of that party's own entitlement.</p>
<p class="note-body">A party receiving a discovery request who asserts a privilege or protection but fails to disclose that claim is at risk of waiving the privilege or protection. A person claiming a privilege or protection who fails to provide adequate information about the privilege or protection claim to the party seeking the information is subject to an order to show cause why the person should not be held in contempt under subdivision (e). Motions for such orders and responses to motions are subject to the sanctions provisions of Rules 7 and 11.</p>
<p class="note-body">A person served a subpoena that is too broad may be faced with a burdensome task to provide full information regarding all that person's claims to privilege or work product protection. Such a person is entitled to protection that may be secured through an objection made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. This provision retains most of the language of the former subdivision (f).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Adequate cause&rdquo; for a failure to obey a subpoena remains undefined. In at least some circumstances, a non-party might be guilty of contempt for refusing to obey a subpoena even though the subpoena manifestly overreaches the appropriate limits of the subpoena power. <em>E.g., Walker v. City of Birmingham</em>, 388 U.S. 307 (1967). But, because the command of the subpoena is not in fact one uttered by a judicial officer, contempt should be very sparingly applied when the non-party witness has been overborne by a party or attorney. The language added to subdivision (f) is intended to assure that result where a non-party has been commanded, on the signature of an attorney, to travel greater distances than can be compelled pursuant to this rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment closes a small gap in regard to notifying witnesses of the manner for recording a deposition. A deposition subpoena must state the method for recording the testimony.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 30(b)(2) directs that the party noticing a deposition state in the notice the manner for recording the testimony, but the notice need not be served on the de<!-- PDFPage:230 -->ponent. The deponent learns of the recording method only if the deponent is a party or is informed by a party. Rule 30(b)(3) permits another party to designate an additional method of recording with prior notice to the deponent and the other parties. The deponent thus has notice of the recording method when an additional method is designated. This amendment completes the notice provisions to ensure that a nonparty deponent has notice of the recording method when the recording method is described only in the deposition notice.</p>
<p class="note-body">A subpoenaed witness does not have a right to refuse to proceed with a deposition due to objections to the manner of recording. But under rare circumstances, a nonparty witness might have a ground for seeking a protective order under Rule 26(c) with regard to the manner of recording or the use of the deposition if recorded in a certain manner. Should such a witness not learn of the manner of recording until the deposition begins, undesirable delay or complication might result. Advance notice of the recording method affords an opportunity to raise such protective issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes are made to conform Rule 45(a)(2) to current style conventions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. Only a small style change has been made in the proposal as published.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2006 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 45 is amended to conform the provisions for subpoenas to changes in other discovery rules, largely related to discovery of electronically stored information. Rule 34 is amended to provide in greater detail for the production of electronically stored information. Rule 45(a)(1)(C) is amended to recognize that electronically stored information, as defined in Rule 34(a), can also be sought by subpoena. Like Rule 34(b), Rule 45(a)(1) is amended to provide that the subpoena can designate a form or forms for production of electronic data. Rule 45(c)(2) is amended, like Rule 34(b), to authorize the person served with a subpoena to object to the requested form or forms. In addition, as under Rule 34(b), Rule 45(d)(1)(B) is amended to provide that if the subpoena does not specify the form or forms for electronically stored information, the person served with the subpoena must produce electronically stored information in a form or forms in which it is usually maintained or in a form or forms that are reasonably usable. Rule 45(d)(1)(C) is added to provide that the person producing electronically stored information should not have to produce the same information in more than one form unless so ordered by the court for good cause.</p>
<p class="note-body">As with discovery of electronically stored information from parties, complying with a subpoena for such information may impose burdens on the responding person. Rule 45(c) provides protection against undue impositions on nonparties. For example, Rule 45(c)(1) directs that a party serving a subpoena &ldquo;shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena,&rdquo; and Rule 45(c)(2)(B) permits the person served with the subpoena to object to it and directs that an order requiring compliance &ldquo;shall protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer from significant expense resulting from&rdquo; compliance. Rule 45(d)(1)(D) is added to provide that the responding person need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources the party identifies as not reasonably accessible, unless the court orders such discovery for good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C), on terms that protect a nonparty against significant expense. A parallel provision is added to Rule 26(b)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 45(a)(1)(B) is also amended, as is Rule 34(a), to provide that a subpoena is available to permit testing and sampling as well as inspection and copying. As in Rule 34, this change recognizes that on occasion the opportunity to perform testing or sampling may be important, both for documents and for electronically stored information. Because testing or sampling may present particular issues of burden or intrusion for the person served with the subpoena, however, the protective provisions of Rule 45(c) should be enforced with vigilance when such demands are made. Inspection or testing of certain types of electronically stored information or of a person's electronic information system may raise issues of confidentiality or privacy. The addition of sampling and testing to Rule 45(a) with regard to documents and electronically stored information is not meant to create a routine right of direct access to a person's electronic information system, although such access might be justified in some circumstances. Courts should guard against undue intrusiveness resulting from inspecting or testing such systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 45(d)(2) is amended, as is Rule 26(b)(5), to add a procedure for assertion of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation materials after production. The receiving party may submit the information to the court for resolution of the privilege claim, as under Rule 26(b)(5)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other minor amendments are made to conform the rule to the changes described above.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. The Committee recommends a modified version of the proposal as published. The changes were made to maintain the parallels between Rule 45 and the other rules that address discovery of electronically stored information. These changes are fully described in the introduction to Rule 45 and in the discussions of the other rules. [Omitted]</p>
<p class="note-body">The changes from the published proposed amendment are shown below. [Omitted]</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 45 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to discovery of &ldquo;books&rdquo; in former Rule 45(a)(1)(C) was deleted to achieve consistent expression throughout the discovery rules. Books remain a proper subject of discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 45(b)(1) required &ldquo;prior notice&rdquo; to each party of any commanded production of documents and things or inspection of premises. Courts have agreed that notice must be given &ldquo;prior&rdquo; to the return date, and have tended to converge on an interpretation that requires notice to the parties before the subpoena is served on the person commanded to produce or permit inspection. That interpretation is adopted in amended Rule 45(b)(1) to give clear notice of general present practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language of former Rule 45(d)(2) addressing the manner of asserting privilege is replaced by adopting the wording of Rule 26(b)(5). The same meaning is better expressed in the same words.</p>
