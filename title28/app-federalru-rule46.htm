<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Admission to the Bar.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Eligibility.</em> An attorney is eligible for admission to the bar of a court of appeals if that attorney is of good moral and professional character and is admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court of a state, another United States court of appeals, or a United States district court (including the district courts for Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Application.</em> An applicant must file an application for admission, on a form approved by the court that contains the applicant's personal statement showing eligibility for membership. The applicant must subscribe to the following oath or affirmation:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">&ldquo;I, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, do solemnly swear [or affirm] that I will conduct myself as an attorney and counselor of this court, uprightly and according to law; and that I will support the Constitution of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Admission Procedures.</em> On written or oral motion of a member of the court's bar, the court will act on the application. An applicant may be admitted by oral motion in open court. But, unless the court orders otherwise, an applicant need not appear before the court to be admitted. Upon admission, an applicant must pay the clerk the fee prescribed by local rule or court order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Suspension or Disbarment.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Standard.</em> A member of the court's bar is subject to suspension or disbarment by the court if the member:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has been suspended or disbarred from practice in any other court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the court's bar.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Procedure.</em> The member must be given an opportunity to show good cause, within the <!-- PDFPage:77 -->time prescribed by the court, why the member should not be suspended or disbarred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Order.</em> The court must enter an appropriate order after the member responds and a hearing is held, if requested, or after the time prescribed for a response expires, if no response is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Discipline.</cap-smallcap> A court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with any court rule. First, however, the court must afford the attorney reasonable notice, an opportunity to show cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The basic requirement of membership in the bar of the Supreme Court, or of the highest court of a state, or in another court of appeals or a district court is found, with minor variations, in the rules of ten circuits. The only other requirement in those circuits is that the applicant be of good moral and professional character. In the District of Columbia Circuit applicants other than members of the District of Columbia District bar or the Supreme Court bar must claim membership in the bar of the highest court of a state, territory or possession for three years prior to application for admission (D.C. Cir. Rule 7). Members of the District of Columbia District bar and the Supreme Court bar again excepted, applicants for admission to the District of Columbia Circuit bar must meet precisely defined prelaw and law school study requirements (D.C. Cir. Rule 7&frac12;).</p>
<p class="note-body">A few circuits now require that application for admission be made by oral motion by a sponsor member in open court. The proposed rule permits both the application and the motion by the sponsor member to be in writing, and permits action on the motion without the appearance of the applicant or the sponsor, unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The provision respecting suspension or disbarment is uniform. Third Circuit Rule 8(3) is typical.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. At present only Fourth Circuit Rule 36 contains an equivalent provision. The purpose of this provision is to make explicit the power of a court of appeals to impose sanctions less serious than suspension or disbarment for the breach of rules. It also affords some measure of control over attorneys who are not members of the bar of the court. Several circuits permit a non-member attorney to file briefs and motions, membership being required only at the time of oral argument. And several circuits permit argument pro hac vice by non-member attorneys.</p>
