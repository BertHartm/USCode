<p class="note-body">Appendix D provides the procedures applicable to congressional reference cases. Revisions effective May 1, 2002 include the deletion from former &nbsp;3 of authority for the filing of a &ldquo;preliminary complaint&rdquo; (a change <!-- PDFPage:464 -->that reflects the corresponding deletion of such authority from the court's basic rules) and the deletion, as unnecessary, of former &nbsp;6, titled &ldquo;Captions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Revisions effective September 15, 2003, reorganize &nbsp;8 (former &nbsp;9) into five subparagraphs. Subparagraph (c) clarifies the review panel's responsibility in the absence of exceptions to a hearing officer's report and identifies the procedures required where modification of such a report is being considered by the review panel. Subparagraph (d) sets out standards for review applicable whether or not exceptions have been taken, including language formerly appearing in &nbsp;7. The restriction on the role of the chief judge in the appeal and review process has been relocated to the end of &nbsp;9.</p>
