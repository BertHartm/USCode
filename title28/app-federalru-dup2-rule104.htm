<h3 class="section-head">Rule 104. Preliminary Questions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Questions of admissibility generally.&mdash;Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (b). In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Relevancy conditioned on fact.&mdash;When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Hearing of jury.&mdash;Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury. Hearings on other preliminary matters shall be so conducted when the interests of justice require, or when an accused is a witness and so requests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Testimony by accused.&mdash;The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Weight and credibility.&mdash;This rule does not limit the right of a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of the Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The applicability of a particular rule of evidence often depends upon the existence of a condi<!-- PDFPage:306 -->tion. Is the alleged expert a qualified physician? Is a witness whose former testimony is offered unavailable? Was a stranger present during a conversation between attorney and client? In each instance the admissibility of evidence will turn upon the answer to the question of the existence of the condition. Accepted practice, incorporated in the rule, places on the judge the responsibility for these determinations. McCormick &sect;53; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 45&ndash;50 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">To the extent that these inquiries are factual, the judge acts as a trier of fact. Often, however, rulings on evidence call for an evaluation in terms of a legally set standard. Thus when a hearsay statement is offered as a declaration against interest, a decision must be made whether it possesses the required against-interest characteristics. These decisions, too, are made by the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of these considerations, this subdivision refers to preliminary requirements generally by the broad term &ldquo;questions,&rdquo; without attempt at specification.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision is of general application. It must, however, be read as subject to the special provisions for &ldquo;conditional relevancy&rdquo; in subdivision (b) and those for confessions in subdivision (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the question is factual in nature, the judge will of necessity receive evidence pro and con on the issue. The rule provides that the rules of evidence in general do not apply to this process. McCormick &sect;53, p. 123, n. 8, points out that the authorities are &ldquo;scattered and inconclusive,&rdquo; and observes:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Should the exclusionary law of evidence, &lsquo;the child of the jury system&rsquo; in Thayer's phrase, be applied to this hearing before the judge? Sound sense backs the view that it should not, and that the judge should be empowered to hear any relevant evidence, such as affidavits or other reliable hearsay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">This view is reinforced by practical necessity in certain situations. An item, offered and objected to, may itself be considered in ruling on admissibility, though not yet admitted in evidence. Thus the content of an asserted declaration against interest must be considered in ruling whether it is against interest. Again, common practice calls for considering the testimony of a witness, particularly a child, in determining competency. Another example is the requirement of Rule 602 dealing with personal knowledge. In the case of hearsay, it is enough, if the declarant &ldquo;so far as appears [has] had an opportunity to observe the fact declared.&rdquo; McCormick, &sect;10, p. 19.</p>
<p class="note-body">If concern is felt over the use of affidavits by the judge in preliminary hearings on admissibility, attention is directed to the many important judicial determinations made on the basis of affidavits. Rule 47 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;An application to the court for an order shall be by motion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It may be supported by affidavit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The Rules of Civil Procedure are more detailed. Rule 43(e), dealing with motions generally, provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;When a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or depositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Rule 4(g) provides for proof of service by affidavit. Rule 56 provides in detail for the entry of summary judgment based on affidavits. Affidavits may supply the foundation for temporary restraining orders under Rule 65(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The study made for the California Law Revision Commission recommended an amendment to Uniform Rule 2 as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In the determination of the issue aforesaid [preliminary determination], exclusionary rules shall not apply, subject, however, to Rule 45 and any valid claim of privilege.&rdquo; Tentative Recommendation and a Study Relating to the Uniform Rules of Evidence (Article VIII, Hearsay), Cal. Law Revision Comm'n, Rep., Rec. & Studies, 470 (1962). The proposal was not adopted in the California Evidence Code. The Uniform Rules are likewise silent on the subject. However, New Jersey Evidence Rule 8(1), dealing with preliminary inquiry by the judge, provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In his determination the rules of evidence shall not apply except for Rule 4 [exclusion on grounds of confusion, etc.] or a valid claim of privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. In some situations, the relevancy of an item of evidence, in the large sense, depends upon the existence of a particular preliminary fact. Thus when a spoken statement is relied upon to prove notice to X, it is without probative value unless X heard it. Or if a letter purporting to be from Y is relied upon to establish an admission by him, it has no probative value unless Y wrote or authorized it. Relevance in this sense has been labelled &ldquo;conditional relevancy.&rdquo; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 45&ndash;46 (1962). Problems arising in connection with it are to be distinguished from problems of logical relevancy, e.g. evidence in a murder case that accused on the day before purchased a weapon of the kind used in the killing, treated in Rule 401.</p>
<p class="note-body">If preliminary questions of conditional relevancy were determined solely by the judge, as provided in subdivision (a), the functioning of the jury as a trier of fact would be greatly restricted and in some cases virtually destroyed. These are appropriate questions for juries. Accepted treatment, as provided in the rule, is consistent with that given fact questions generally. The judge makes a preliminary determination whether the foundation evidence is sufficient to support a finding of fulfillment of the condition. If so, the item is admitted. If after all the evidence on the issue is in, pro and con, the jury could reasonably conclude that fulfillment of the condition is not established, the issue is for them. If the evidence is not such as to allow a finding, the judge withdraws the matter from their consideration. Morgan, <em>supra</em>; California Evidence Code &sect;403; New Jersey Rule 8(2). See also Uniform Rules 19 and 67.</p>
<p class="note-body">The order of proof here, as generally, is subject to the control of the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Preliminary hearings on the admissibility of confessions must be conducted outside the hearing of the jury. See <em>Jackson v. Denno</em>, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). Otherwise, detailed treatment of when preliminary matters should be heard outside the hearing of the jury is not feasible. The procedure is time consuming. Not infrequently the same evidence which is relevant to the issue of establishment of fulfillment of a condition precedent to admissibility is also relevant to weight or credibility, and time is saved by taking foundation proof in the presence of the jury. Much evidence on preliminary questions, though not relevant to jury issues, may be heard by the jury with no adverse effect. A great deal must be left to the discretion of the judge who will act as the interests of justice require.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The limitation upon cross-examination is designed to encourage participation by the accused in the determination of preliminary matters. He may testify concerning them without exposing himself to cross-examination generally. The provision is necessary because of the breadth of cross-examination under Rule 611(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not address itself to questions of the subsequent use of testimony given by an accused at a hearing on a preliminary matter. See <em>Walder v. United States</em>, 347 U.S. 62 (1954): <em>Simmons v. United States</em>, 390 U.S. 377 (1968): <em>Harris v. New York</em>, 401 U.S. 222 (1971)</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. For similar provisions see Uniform Rule 8; California Evidence Code &sect;406; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;408; New Jersey Evidence Rule 8(1).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 104(c) as submitted to the Congress provided that hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall be conducted outside the presence of the jury and hearings on all other preliminary matters should be so conducted when the interests of justice require. The Committee amended the Rule to provide that where an accused is a witness as to a preliminary matter, he has the right, upon his request, to be heard outside the <!-- PDFPage:307 -->jury's presence. Although recognizing that in some cases duplication of evidence would occur and that the procedure could be subject to abuse, the Committee believed that a proper regard for the right of an accused not to testify generally in the case dictates that he be given an option to testify out of the presence of the jury on preliminary matters.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee construes the second sentence of subdivision (c) as applying to civil actions and proceedings as well as to criminal cases, and on this assumption has left the sentence unamended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under rule 104(c) the hearing on a preliminary matter may at times be conducted in front of the jury. Should an accused testify in such a hearing, waiving his privilege against self-incrimination as to the preliminary issue, rule 104(d) provides that he will not generally be subject to cross-examination as to any other issue. This rule is not, however, intended to immunize the accused from cross-examination where, in testifying about a preliminary issue, he injects other issues into the hearing. If he could not be cross-examined about any issues gratuitously raised by him beyond the scope of the preliminary matters, injustice result. Accordingly, in order to prevent any such unjust result, the committee intends the rule to be construed to provide that the accused may subject himself to cross-examination as to issues raised by his own testimony upon a preliminary matter before a jury.</p>
