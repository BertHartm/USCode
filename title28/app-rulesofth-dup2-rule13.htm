<h3 class="section-head">Rule 13. Counterclaim and Cross-Claim</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if (1) the claim involves the imported merchandise that is the subject matter of the civil action, or (2) the claim is to recover upon a bond or customs duties relating to such merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim. A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Counterclaim Against the United States. These rules shall not be construed to enlarge beyond the limits now fixed by law the right to assert counterclaims or to claim credits against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading. A claim which either matured or was acquired by the pleader after serving a pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Omitted Counterclaim. When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Cross-Claim Against Co-Party. A pleading may state as a cross-claim any claim by one party against a co-party, if (1) the claim involves the imported merchandise that is the subject matter of the civil action, or (2) the claim is to recover upon a bond or customs duties relating to such merchandise. Such cross-claim may include a claim that the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Joinder of Additional Parties. Persons other than those made parties to the original action may be made parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim in accordance with the provisions of Rules 19 and 20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Separate Trials&mdash;Separate Judgments. If the court orders separate trials as provided in Rule 42(b), judgment on a counterclaim or cross-claim may be rendered in accordance with the terms of Rule 54(b) when the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party have been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Demand for a Complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the pendency of the civil action on a Reserve or Suspension Calendar, in a civil action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(a) or (b), for good cause shown, a defendant who wishes to proceed expeditiously in the action may file a motion demanding that the plaintiff file a complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The motion shall include, among other information, (A) a statement of the reasons for wanting to proceed at this time, (B) a proposed timetable for requiring the plaintiff to file a complaint if different from the time provided for in this rule and the reasons for a different time, and, in a suspended action, other scheduling information that the defendant believes necessary to enable the court to formulate an order removing a suspended action from a Suspension Calendar, and (C) a description of any counterclaim known to the defendant at the time the motion is filed that the defendant intends to assert in its answer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an order granting a motion for a demand for a complaint is entered, plaintiff shall file its complaint within 30 days after the date of service of the order if plaintiff wishes to continue the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an order granting a motion for a demand for a complaint is entered and plaintiff does not voluntarily dismiss the action or fails to file a complaint, the clerk shall enter an order of dismissal without further direction from the court.</p>
