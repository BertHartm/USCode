<p class="note-body">The revised section omits a reference to the Chief Justice contained in said section 22, since in exercising the powers under subsection (b), he acts as a circuit justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (d) of said section 17, making the section applicable to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is omitted since such court is included in this revision because the District of Columbia is made a separate circuit. (See section 41 of this title.)</p>

<p class="note-body">The words in said section 17 &ldquo;for such time as the business of such district court may require,&rdquo; were omitted as inconsistent with the language of said section 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which employed the words &ldquo;the public interest requires&rdquo; and &ldquo;from time to time and until he shall otherwise direct.&rdquo; The revised section and sections 294 and 296 of this title make clear the power to make designation and assignment without any limitation of time, to revoke such designation and assignment and to make, from time to time, new designations and assignments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;chief judge&rdquo; of the circuit was substituted for &ldquo;senior circuit judge.&rdquo; (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">References in said sections 17 and 22 to retired judges were omitted as covered by section 294 of this title.</p>
