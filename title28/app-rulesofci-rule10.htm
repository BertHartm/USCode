<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Caption; Names of Parties.</cap-smallcap> Every pleading must have a caption with the court's name, a title, a file number, and a Rule 7(a) designation. The title of the complaint must name all the parties; the title of other pleadings, after naming the first party on each side, may refer generally to other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Paragraphs; Separate Statements.</cap-smallcap> A party must state its claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances. A later pleading may refer by number to a paragraph in an earlier pleading. If doing so would promote clarity, each claim founded on a separate transaction or occurrence&mdash;and each defense other than a denial&mdash;must be stated in a separate count or defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Adoption by Reference; Exhibits.</cap-smallcap> A statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference elsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.</p>

<p class="note-body">The first sentence is derived in part from the opening statement of [former] Equity Rule 25 (Bill of Complaint&mdash;Contents). The remainder of the rule is an expansion in conformity with usual state provisions. For numbered paragraphs and separate statements, see Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930) &sect;5513; Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;157 (2); N.Y.R.C.P. (1937) Rule 90. For incorporation by reference, see N.Y.R.C.P. (1937) Rule 90. For written instruments as exhibits, see Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;160.</p>
