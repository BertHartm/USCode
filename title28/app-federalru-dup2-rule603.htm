<p class="note-body">The rule is designed to afford the flexibility required in dealing with religious adults, atheists, conscientious objectors, mental defectives, and children. Affirmation is simply a solemn undertaking to tell the truth; no special verbal formula is required. As is true generally, affirmation is recognized by federal law. &ldquo;Oath&rdquo; includes affirmation, 1 U.S.C. &sect;1; judges and clerks may administer oaths and affirmations, 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;459, 953; and affirmations are acceptable in lieu of oaths under Rule 43(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Perjury by a witness is a crime, 18 U.S.C. &sect;1621.</p>
