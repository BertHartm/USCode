<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Setting a case for trial is the responsibility of the judge to whom the case is assigned, and may be made (1) without request of the parties or (2) upon request of a party and notice to the other parties or (3) in such other manner as the court deems expedient. All trials shall be scheduled by the judge by order filed with the clerk. Precedence shall be given to actions entitled thereto by any statute of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The text of RCFC 40 parallels, but is not identical to, FRCP 40. Like its federal rules counterpart, however, the purpose of the rule is to identify the responsibility of the judge in scheduling a matter for trial. The changes made to the text of the rule are minor and intended to clarify the rule's essential purpose, i.e., that it is the judge's responsibility to determine the date and place of trial in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;173, 798(a), and 2503(c).</p>
