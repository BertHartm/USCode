<p class="note-body">The purpose of this section is to remove all doubt as to whether the mere beginning of a new term at one place ends a prior term begun at another place. As revised, it conforms to a uniform course of judicial decisions. See <em>U.S. v. Perlstein</em>, 39 F.Supp. 965, 968 (D.C.N.J. 1941), and cases cited.</p>
