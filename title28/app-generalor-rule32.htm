<h3 class="section-head">Rule 32. Use of Depositions in Court Proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Use of Depositions.</strong> At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions, in addition to Appendix G &nbsp;12b, governing the use of depositions as substantive evidence:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership, or association, or governmental agency which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds: <strong>(A)</strong> that the witness is dead; or <strong>(B)</strong> that the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing and the judge after timely request has refused to authorize a subpoena to the witness or to set a trial in closer proximity to the place of residence of the witness, or is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or <strong>(C)</strong> that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, ill<!-- PDFPage:375 -->ness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or <strong>(D)</strong> that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or <strong>(E)</strong> upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4)</strong> If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Substitution of parties pursuant to Rule 25 does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken; and, when an action has been brought in any court of the United States or of any State and another action involving the same subject matter is afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken therefor. A deposition previously taken may also be used as permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Objections to Admissibility.</strong> Subject to the provisions of Rules 28(b) and 32(d)(3), objection may be made at the trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Effect of Taking or Using Depositions.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Errors and Irregularities in Depositions. (1) <em>As to Notice.</em></strong> All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>As to Disqualification of Officer.</em></strong> Objection to taking a deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>As to Taking of Deposition. </em></strong><strong>(A)</strong> Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> Objections to the form of written questions submitted under Rule 31 are waived unless served in writing upon the party propounding them within the time allowed for serving the succeeding cross or other questions and within 5 days after service of the last questions authorized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4) <em>As to Completion and Return of Deposition.</em></strong> Errors and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, transmitted, delivered or mailed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under Rules 30 and 31 are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.</p>
