<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Before Action.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Petition.</strong> A person who desires to perpetuate testimony regarding any matter that may be cognizable in the court may file a verified petition. The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and shall show: 1, that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action cognizable in the court but is presently unable to bring it or cause it to be brought, 2, the subject matter of the expected action and the petitioner's interest therein, 3, the facts which the petitioner desires to establish by the proposed testimony and the reasons for desiring to perpetuate it, 4, [Not used.], and 5, the names and addresses of the persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the petitioner expects to elicit from each, and shall ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to take the depositions of the persons to be examined named in the petition, for the purpose of perpetuating their testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Notice and Service.</strong> The petition shall be served upon the United States in the same manner as a complaint. See RCFC 4. The petitioner may thereafter, by motion served upon counsel for the United States (see RCFC 5), request a hearing or the court may, <em>sua sponte</em>, by order, set a hearing on the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Order and Examination.</strong> If the court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, it shall make an order designating or describing the persons whose depositions may be taken and specifying the subject matter of the examination and whether the depositions shall be taken upon oral examination or written interrogatories. The depositions may then be taken in accordance with these rules; and the court may make orders of the character provided for by RCFC 34 and 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Use of Deposition.</strong> If a deposition to perpetuate testimony is taken under these rules, it may be used in any action involving the same subject matter subsequently brought in this court, in accordance with the provisions of RCFC 32(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pending Appeal.</strong> If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of the court or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the court may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in this court. In such case the party who desires to perpetuate the testimony may make a motion for leave to take the depositions, upon the same notice and service thereof as if the action was pending in this court. The motion shall show (1) the names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the party expects to elicit from each; (2) the reasons for perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by RCFC 34 and 35, and thereupon the depositions may be taken and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in these rules for depositions taken in actions pending in this court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Perpetuation by Action.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
