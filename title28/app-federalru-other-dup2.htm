<h3 class="section-head">Rule 13. Review of a Decision of the Tax Court</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>How Obtained; Time for Filing Notice of Appeal</em>.&mdash;Review of a decision of the United States Tax Court must be obtained by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the Tax Court within 90 days after entry of the Tax Court's decision. At the time of filing the appellant must furnish the clerk with sufficient copies of the notice of appeal to enable the clerk to comply promptly with the requirements of Rule 3(d). If a timely notice of appeal is filed by one party, any other party may take an appeal by filing a notice of appeal within 120 days after entry of the Tax Court's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The running of the time for appeal is terminated as to all parties by a timely motion to vacate or revise a decision made pursuant to the Rules of Practice of the Tax Court. The full time for appeal commences to run and is to be computed from the entry of an order disposing of such motion, or from the entry of decision, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Notice of appeal&mdash;How filed</em>.&mdash;The notice of appeal may be filed by deposit in the office of the clerk of the Tax Court in the District of Columbia or by mail addressed to the clerk. If a notice is delivered to the clerk by mail and is received after expiration of the last day allowed for filing, the postmark date shall be deemed to be the date of delivery, subject to the provisions of &sect;7502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <em>Content of the notice of appeal; service of the notice; effect of filing and service of the notice</em>.&mdash;The content of the notice of appeal, the manner of its service, and the effect of the filing of the notice and of its service shall be as prescribed by Rule 3. Form 2 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of the notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <em>The record on appeal; transmission of the record; filing of the record</em>.&mdash;The provisions of Rules 10, 11 and 12 respecting the record and the time and manner of its transmission and filing and the docketing of the appeal in the court of appeals in cases on appeal from the district courts shall govern in cases on appeal from the Tax Court. Each reference in those rules and in Rule 3 to the district court and to the clerk of the district court shall be read as a reference to the Tax Court and to the clerk of the Tax Court respectively. If appeals are taken from a decision of the Tax Court to more than one court of appeals, the original record shall be transmitted to the court of appeals named in the first notice of appeal filed. Provision for the record in any other appeal shall be made upon appropriate application by the appellant to the court of appeals to which such other appeal is taken.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a</em>). This subdivision effects two changes in practice respecting review of Tax Court decisions: (1) Section 7483 of the Internal Revenue Code, 68A Stat. 891, 26 U.S.C. &sect;7483, provides that review of a Tax Court decision may be obtained by filing a petition for re<!-- PDFPage:21 -->view. The subdivision provides for review by the filing of the simple and familiar notice of appeal used to obtain review of district court judgments; (2) Section 7483, <em>supra</em>, requires that a petition for review be filed within 3 months after a decision is rendered, and provides that if a petition is so filed by one party, any other party may file a petition for review within 4 months after the decision is rendered. In the interest of fixing the time for review with precision, the proposed rule substitutes &ldquo;90 days&rdquo; and &ldquo;120 days&rdquo; for the statutory &ldquo;3 months&rdquo; and &ldquo;4 months&rdquo;, respectively. The power of the Court to regulate these details of practice is clear. Title 28 U.S.C. &sect;2072, as amended by the Act of November 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 1323 (1 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 1546 (1966)), authorizes the Court to regulate &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. practice and procedure in proceedings for the review by the courts of appeals of decisions of the Tax Court of the United States.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph states the settled teaching of the case law. See <em>Robert Louis Stevenson Apartments, Inc. v. C.I.R</em>., 337 F.2d 681, 10 A.L.R.3d 112 (8th Cir., 1964); <em>Denholm & McKay Co. v. C.I.R</em>., 132 F.2d 243 (1st Cir., 1942); <em>Helvering v. Continental Oil Co</em>., 63 App.D.C. 5, 68 F.2d 750 (1934); <em>Burnet v. Lexington Ice & Coal Co</em>., 62 F.2d 906 (4th Cir., 1933); <em>Griffiths v. C.I.R</em>., 50 F.2d 782 (7th Cir., 1931).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b</em>). The subdivision incorporates the statutory provision (Title 26, U.S.C. &sect;7502) that timely mailing is to be treated as timely filing. The statute contains special provisions respecting other than ordinary mailing. If the notice of appeal is sent by registered mail, registration is deemed prima facie evidence that the notice was delivered to the clerk of the Tax Court, and the date of registration is deemed the postmark date. If the notice of appeal is sent by certified mail, the effect of certification with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date depends upon regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. The effect of a postmark made other than by the United States Post Office likewise depends upon regulations of the Secretary. Current regulations are found in 26 CFR &sect;301.7502&ndash;1.</p>
