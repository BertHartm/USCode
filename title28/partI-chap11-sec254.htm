<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;296 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, 187(a), as added Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843, &sect;1, 54 Stat. 1101).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section contains a part of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Other provisions of such section are incorporated in sections 251, 252, 253, 456, 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;when in the opinion of such division or judge the ends of justice so require,&rdquo; which followed the phrase &ldquo;grant a rehearing or retrial,&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;chief judge&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;presiding judge.&rdquo; (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;petitions for remission of additional duties&rdquo; was added to the first paragraph at the suggestion of the court to conform to existing practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reappraisement appeals are heard by a single judge and reviewed by a division. (See sections 2631 and 2636 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the presiding judge shall designate one of the three judges of a division to preside over such division was omitted as in conflict with section 253 of this title (also taken from section 296 of title 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed.), which provides that judges shall preside according to the seniority of their commissions. The latter provision is in accord with present practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in arrangement and phraseology.</p>
