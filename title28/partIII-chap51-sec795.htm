<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;244 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;139, 36 Stat. 1136).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the bailiff should serve 4 years unless sooner removed by the court for cause, was changed by omitting the 4-year tenure and removal &ldquo;for cause&rdquo; requirement. As revised this section conforms with sections relating to the similar court officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Term &ldquo;chief messenger&rdquo; in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was changed to &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; as the court has but one messenger.</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision of section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing for appointment of a clerk and assistant is incorporated in section 791 of this title, and a provision thereof, relating to powers and duties of the clerk, his deputies and assistants, is incorporated in section 956 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph was added to conform with sections 713, 755, and 834 of this title.</p>
