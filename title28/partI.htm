<p class="note-body">Form of section was simplified.</p>
<p class="note-body">The District of Columbia was added as a separate circuit. This is in accord with the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which held the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to be a circuit court of appeals within the Transfer Act of Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 305, 42 Stat. 837, incorporated in the Judicial Code as &sect;238(a), but repealed by act Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, &sect;13, 43 Stat. 942.

<!-- PDFPage:11 --><p class="note-body">In recognizing the District of Columbia as a separate circuit, the Supreme Court recently used this language: &ldquo;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the eleven circuits forming the single federal judicature *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo;. <em>Comm'r. v. Bedford's Estate</em>, 65 S.Ct. 1157, at page 1160, 325 U.S. 283, 89 L.Ed. 611.</p>
<p class="note-body">See section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing, &ldquo;For the purposes of sections 17&ndash;23 of this title, the District of Columbia shall be deemed to be a judicial circuit *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo;, and act Dec. 23, 1944, ch. 724, 58 Stat. 925, which amended section 215 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., incorporated in section 42 of this title.

See also Rule 81(d) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the following cases the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized the status of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia as a permanent establishment within the federal judicial system: <em>O'Donoghue v. United States</em>, 1933, 53 S.Ct. 740, 289 U.S. 516, 77 L.Ed. 1356; <em>Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner</em>, 1927, 47 S.Ct. 557, 274 U.S. 145, 71 L.Ed. 972; <em>Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry v.

<p class="note-body">The last paragraph was added to make clear the intent of Congress that the powers of the Court to assign the justices among the several circuits should be completely flexible.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision in section 212 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for a three-judge court of appeals was permissive and did not limit the power of the court to sit in banc.

<p class="note-body">This section includes the members of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and designates them as &ldquo;judges&rdquo; rather than as &ldquo;justices&rdquo;, thus harmonizing it with the provisions of section 41 of this title, which specifically designates the District of Columbia as a judicial circuit of the United States. In doing so it consolidates sections 11&ndash;201, 11&ndash;202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., which provided for one &ldquo;chief justice&rdquo; and five associate &ldquo;justices.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Act February 9, 1893, established a court of appeals for the District of Columbia to consist of one chief justice and two associate justices whose jurisdiction was almost entirely to review the judgments of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, the name of which was changed in 1936 to the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia. Circuit courts were established by the first Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, &sect;4, and R.S. &sect;608, enacted June 22, 1874. R.S. &sect;605 provided that the words &ldquo;circuit justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;justice of a circuit&rdquo; should designate the justice of the Supreme Court of the United States allotted to any circuit; that &ldquo;judge&rdquo; when applied to any circuit included such justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Judiciary Appropriation Act, 1945, Act June 26, 1944, ch. 277, &sect;202, 58 Stat. 358, provided that as used in that Act, &ldquo;the term &lsquo;circuit court of appeals&rsquo; includes the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; the term &lsquo;senior circuit judge&rsquo; includes the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term &lsquo;circuit judge&rsquo; includes associate justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term &lsquo;judge&rsquo; includes justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions in section 11&ndash;202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and section 213 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of salaries in monthly installments were omitted, since time of payment is a matter of administrative convenience (20 Comp. Gen. 834).</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception in subsection (c) extends to circuit judges in the District of Columbia the effect of the recent decision in <em>U.S. ex rel. Laughlin v. Eicher</em>, D.C. 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See Reviser's Note under section 134 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in section 213 of the title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that &ldquo;it shall be the duty of each circuit judge in each circuit to sit as one of the judges of the circuit court of appeals in that circuit from time to time according to law,&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary since the duty to serve is implied by the creation and composition of the court in section 43 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Last sentence, providing that nothing in section 213 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., should prevent a circuit judge from holding district court as provided by law, was omitted as unnecessary. (See section 291 of this title authorizing assignments to district courts.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based in part on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;212 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;117, 36 Stat. 1131).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (a)&ndash;(c) authorize the establishment of divisions of the court and provide for the assignment of circuit judges for hearings and rehearings in banc.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that, notwithstanding the three-judge provision of section 212 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., a court of appeals might lawfully consist of a greater number of judges, and that the five active circuit judges of the third circuit might sit in banc for the determination of an appeal. (See <em>Textile Mills Securities Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</em>, 1941, 62 S.Ct. 272, 314 U.S. 326, 86 L.Ed. 249.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court in upholding the unanimous view of the five judges as to their right to sit in banc, notwithstanding the contrary opinion in <em>Langs Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</em>, 1938, 97 F.2d 867, said in the Textile Mills case: &ldquo;There are numerous functions of the court, as a &lsquo;court of record, with appellate jurisdiction&rsquo;, other than hearing and deciding appeals. Under the Judicial Code these embrace: prescribing the form of writs and other process and the form and style of its seal (28 U.S.C., &sect;219); the making of rules and regulations (28 U.S.C., &sect;219); the appointment of a clerk (28 U.S.C., &sect;221) and the approval of the appointment and removal of deputy clerks (28 U.S.C., &sect;222); and the fixing of the &lsquo;times&rsquo; when court shall be held (28 U.S.C., &sect;223). Furthermore, those various sections of the Judicial Code provide that each of these functions shall be performed by the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">This section preserves the interpretation established by the Textile Mills case but provides in subsection (c) that cases shall be heard by a court of not more than three judges unless the court has provided for hearing in banc. This provision continues the tradition of a three-judge appellate court and makes the decision of a division, the decision of the court, unless rehearing in banc is ordered. It makes judges available for other assignments, and permits a rotation of judges in such manner as to give to each a maximum of time for the preparation of opinions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Whether divisions should sit simultaneously at the same or different places in the circuit is a matter for each court to determine.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;1 and section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, &sect;34, 31 Stat. 84; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;1, 36 Stat. 1087; Jan. 7, 1913; ch. 6, 37 Stat. 648; July 30, 1914, ch. 216, 38 Stat. 580; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, &sect;41, 39 Stat. 965; Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, &sect;1, 41 Stat. 1412; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, &sect;1, 42 Stat. 837; Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, &sect;2, 52 Stat. 118).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates the last paragraph of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with portions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the number of judges in the various districts are incorporated in section 133 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of section 863, see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception in subsection (b) &ldquo;except in the District of Columbia&rdquo; conforms with the recent decision in <em>U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher</em>, 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See reviser's note under section 44 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The clause in said last paragraph of section 1 of title 28 providing that any district judge, who violates the residence requirement, shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, was omitted. This penalty provision was attached to the residence requirement at the time of compilation of the Revised Statutes of 1878, although it is apparent that Congress only intended that the penalty should be invoked upon the unauthorized practice of law. See <em>U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher</em>, supra, in which an outline of the history of said section 1 of title 28 is given.</p>

<p class="note-body">The &ldquo;Board of General Appraisers&rdquo; was designated &ldquo;United States Customs Court&rdquo; by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, &sect;1, 44 Stat. 669. General provisions concerning such court were incorporated in section 1518 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, until amended by act October 10, 1940, ch. 843, &sect;1, 54 Stat. 1101, adding a new section to the Judicial Code of 1911, when they were transferred to section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. They are retained in title 28 by this revision.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this connection former Congressman Walter Chandler said, &ldquo;Among the major subjects needing study and revision are special courts, such as the Customs Court, which should be fitted into the judicial system.&rdquo; (See U.S. Law Weekly, Nov. 7, 1939.)</p>
<!-- field-end:historicalandrevision-note -->

<h4 class="note-head">History of Court</h4>
<p class="note-body">The United States Customs Court [now Court of International Trade] as &ldquo;constituted on June 17, 1930&rdquo;, consisted of nine members as provided by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, &sect;518, 42 Stat. 972, which established the Board of General Appraisers, designated the &ldquo;United States Customs Court&rdquo; by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, &sect;1, 44 Stat. 669.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions similar to these were contained in act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, &sect;518, 42 Stat. 972. That section was superseded by section 518 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and was repealed by section 651 (a)(1) of said 1930 act.</p>
<p class="note-body">The sentence in the former first paragraph as to sitting in a case previously participated in, is from act Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, &sect;28, 36 Stat. 98, which combined and amended Customs Administrative Act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, &sect;12, 26 Stat. 136, and section 31, as added by act May 27, 1908, ch. 205, 35 Stat. 406. Section 12 of the act of 1890 was expressly saved from repeal by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, &sect;643, 42 Stat. 989, and prior acts, but its provisions, other than the sentence above mentioned, were omitted from the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions for the review of decisions of Boards of General Appraisers by the Circuit Courts, made by sec<!-- PDFPage:92 -->tion 15 of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, were superseded by provisions for such review by the Court of Customs Appeals created by section 29 added to that act by the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6. The provisions of said new section 29 were incorporated in and superseded by chapter 8 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, incorporated into the Code as former chapter 8 of Title 28, Judicial Code and Judiciary.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;2608 provided for the appointment of four appraisers of merchandise, to be employed in visiting ports of entry under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and to assist in the appraisement of merchandise as might be deemed necessary by the Secretary to protect and insure uniformity in the collection of the revenue from customs. It was repealed by act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, &sect;29, 26 Stat. 141.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;2609 provided for the appointment of merchant appraisers. R.S. &sect;2610 made every merchant refusing to serve as such appraiser liable to a penalty. Both sections were superseded by the provisions relating to appraisers and appraisements of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, 26 Stat. 131, and subsequent acts, and were repealed by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, &sect;642, 42 Stat. 989.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;2945, which contained a provision similar to that of R.S. &sect;2610, was repealed, without mention of section 2610, by said Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, &sect;29, 26 Stat. 141, and was again repealed by section 642 of act Sept. 21, 1922.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;2725, which prescribed the compensation of merchant appraisers, and section 2726, which prescribed the salary of the general appraiser at New York, were superseded by the provisions relating to general appraisers and appraisers made by the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, &sect;&sect;12, 13, 26 Stat. 136, as amended by the Payne-Aldrich Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, &sect;28.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;2727 fixed the salary of the four general appraisers at the sum of $2,500 a year each, and their actual traveling expenses. It was repealed by act Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, 19 Stat. 246.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;17, 21 and 216 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;13, 17, 120, 36 Stat. 1089, 1132; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, &sect;3, 42 Stat. 839; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, &sect;4, 50 Stat. 753; Dec. 29, 1942, ch. 835, &sect;1, 56 Stat. 1094).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates and simplifies all provisions of sections 17, 21 and 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation and assignment of district judges.</p>
<p class="note-body">Term &ldquo;chief judge&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;senior circuit judge.&rdquo; (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 17 and 21 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were inconsistent insofar as the words &ldquo;or in his absence, the circuit judges thereof,&rdquo; appearing in said section 17 were not in section 21, and the words &ldquo;senior circuit judge then present in the circuit,&rdquo; appearing in section 21 were not in section 17. The revised section omits all such words and leaves designation of assignment to the chief judge of the circuit. If the chief judge is unable to perform his duties they devolve, under section 45 of this title, upon the circuit judge next in seniority of commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of said section 17, that designation of a district judge to another circuit should be from an adjacent circuit if practicable, was omitted as an unnecessary restriction on the discretion of the Chief Justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 19 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is omitted as unnecessary. It authorized the Chief Justice of the United States to designate and assign any district judge to a district upon receiving a certificate from the clerk of the district that all circuit judges and the circuit justice were absent from the circuit, or were unable to appoint a substitute judge for the district,or where the district judge actually designated was disabled or neglected to hold court.</p>
<p class="note-body">For omission of reference in said section 17 to senior Associate Justice, see reviser's note under section 291 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference in said section 17 to retired judges were omitted as covered by section 294 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of said section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 291, 295, and 296 of this title. Other provisions of said section 216 of such title are incorporated in sections 45 and 47 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;either in a district court or court of appeals&rdquo; were inserted in subsection (c) as suggested by Hon. Learned Hand, Senior Circuit Judge of the Second Circuit. The revised section permits a district judge to be assigned directly to the circuit court of appeals of another circuit. Under existing law it has been assumed that he must be assigned to serve as a district judge on the other circuit and then designated to serve on the circuit court of appeals by that court in which his services are required.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many changes were made in phraseology.</p>

He shall preside at such conference which shall be known as the Judicial Conference of the United States. Special sessions of the Conference may be called by the Chief Justice at such times and places as he may designate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shall be chosen by the circuit and district judges of the circuit and shall serve as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States for a term of not less than 3 successive years nor more than 5 successive years, as established by majority vote of all circuit and district judges of the circuit. A district judge serving as a member of the Judicial Conference may be either a judge in regular active service or a judge retired from regular active service under section 371(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the chief judge of any circuit, the chief judge of the Court of International Trade, or the district judge chosen by the judges of the circuit is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may summon any other circuit or district judge from such circuit or any other judge of the Court of International Trade, as the case may be. Every judge summoned shall attend and, unless excused by the Chief Justice, shall remain throughout the sessions of the conference and advise as to the needs of his circuit or court and as to any matters in respect of which the administration of justice in the courts of the United States may be improved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Conference shall make a comprehensive survey of the condition of business in the courts of the United States and prepare plans for assignment of judges to or from circuits or districts where necessary. It shall also submit suggestions and recommendations to the various courts to promote uniformity of management procedures and the expeditious conduct of court business. The Conference is authorized to exercise the authority provided in chapter 16 of this title as the Conference, or through a standing committee. If the Conference elects to establish a standing committee, it shall be appointed by the Chief Justice and all petitions for review shall be reviewed by that committee. The Conference or the standing committee may hold hearings, take sworn testimony, issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, and make necessary and appropriate orders in the exercise of its authority. Subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum shall be issued by the clerk of the Supreme Court or by the clerk of any court of appeals, at the direction of the Chief Justice or his designee and under the seal of the court, and shall be served in the manner provided in rule 45(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or any agency thereof. The Conference may also prescribe and modify rules for the exercise of the authority provided in chapter 16 of this title. All judicial officers and employees of the United States shall promptly carry into effect all orders of the Judicial Conference or the standing committee established pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Conference shall also carry on a continuous study of the operation and effect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States pursuant to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the Conference may deem desirable to promote simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, the just determination of litigation, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay shall be recommended by the Conference from time to time to the Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modification or rejection, in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Judicial Conference shall review rules prescribed under section 2071 of this title by the courts, other than the Supreme Court and the district courts, for consistency with Federal law. The Judicial Conference may modify or abrogate any such rule so reviewed found inconsistent in the course of such a review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall, upon request of the Chief Justice, report to such Conference on matters relating to the business of the several courts of the United States, with particular reference to cases to which the United States is a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Chief Justice shall submit to Congress an annual report of the proceedings of the Judicial Conference and its recommendations for legislation.</p>

In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;judicial security&rdquo; includes the security of buildings housing the judiciary, the personal security of judicial officers, the assessment of threats made to judicial officers, and the protection of all other judicial personnel. <!-- PDFPage:103 -->The United States Marshals Service retains final authority regarding security requirements for the judicial branch of the Federal Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a successor to a justice or judge who retires under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In order to continue receiving the salary of the office under subsection (b), a justice must be certified in each calendar year by the Chief Justice, and a judge must be certified by the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits, as having met the requirements set forth in at least one of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The justice or judge must have carried in the preceding calendar year a caseload involving courtroom participation which is equal to or greater than the amount of work involving courtroom participation which an average judge in active service would perform in three months. In the instance of a justice or judge who has sat on both district courts and courts of appeals, the caseload of appellate work and trial work shall be determined separately and the results of those determinations added together for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The justice or judge performed in the preceding calendar year substantial judicial duties not involving courtroom participation under subparagraph (A), including settlement efforts, motion decisions, writing opinions in cases that have not been orally argued, and administrative duties for the court to which the justice or judge is assigned. Any certification under this subparagraph shall include a statement describing in detail the nature and amount of work and certifying that the work done is equal to or greater than the work described in this subparagraph which an average judge in active service would perform in three months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed work described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in an amount which, when calculated in accordance with such subparagraphs, in the aggregate equals at least 3 months work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed substantial administrative duties directly related to the operation of the courts, or has performed substantial duties for a Federal or State governmental entity. A certification under this subparagraph shall specify that the work done is equal to the full-time work of an employee of the judicial branch. In any year in which a justice or judge performs work described under this subparagraph for less than the full year, one-half of such work may be aggregated with work described under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph for the purpose of the justice or judge satisfying the requirements of such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The justice or judge was unable in the preceding calendar year to perform judicial or administrative work to the extent required by any of subparagraphs (A) through (D) because of a temporary or permanent disability. A certification under this subparagraph shall be made to a justice who certifies in writing his or her disability to the Chief Justice, and to a judge who certifies in writing his or her disability to the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits. A justice or judge who is certified under this subparagraph as having a permanent disability shall be deemed to have met the requirements of this subsection for each calendar year thereafter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Determinations of work performed under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) shall be made pursuant to rules promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States. In promulgating such criteria, the Judicial Conference shall take into account existing standards promulgated by the Conference for allocation of space and staff for senior judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If in any year a justice or judge who retires under subsection (b) does not receive a certification under this subsection (except as provided in paragraph (1)(E)), he or she may thereafter receive a certification for that year by satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in a subsequent year and attributing a sufficient <!-- PDFPage:114 -->part of the work performed in such subsequent year to the earlier year so that the work so attributed, when added to the work performed during such earlier year, satisfies the requirements for certification for that year. However, a justice or judge may not receive credit for the same work for purposes of certification for more than 1 year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of any justice or judge who retires under subsection (b) during a calendar year, there shall be included in the determination under this subsection of work performed during that calendar year all work performed by that justice or judge (as described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1)) during that calendar year before such retirement.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;375 and 375a (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;260, 36 Stat. 1161; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, &sect;6, 40 Stat. 1157; Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 419, 45 Stat. 1422; Mar. 1, 1937, ch. 21, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 50 Stat. 24; Feb. 11, 1938, ch. 25, &sect;1, 52 Stat. 28; May 11, 1944, ch. 192, &sect;1, 58 Stat. 218).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates provisions of sections 375 and 375a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to resignation and retirement. Remaining provisions of said section 375 now appear in sections 136, 294, and 756 of this title, and remaining provisions of said section 375a now appear in section 294 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;may resign, or may retain his office but retire from regular active service&rdquo; were used to clarify the difference between resignation and retirement. Resignation results in loss of the judge's office, while retirement does not. (<em>Booth v. U.S</em>., 1933, 54 S. Ct. 379, 291 U.S. 339, 78 L. Ed. 836; <em>U.S. v. Moore</em>, 1939, 101 F. 2d 56, certiorari denied 59 S. Ct. 788, 306 U.S. 664, 83 L. Ed. 1060.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Terms &ldquo;judge of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;justice of the United States&rdquo; are defined in section 451 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section continues the provision respecting the salary of a resigned judge but changes such provision for retired judges and makes them eligible to receive any increases provided by Congress for the office from which they retired. This change is in harmony with the clear line of distinction drawn by Congress between retirement and resignation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any justice or judge of the United States appointed to hold office during good behavior who becomes permanently disabled from performing his duties may retire from regular active service, and the President shall, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint a successor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Any justice or judge of the United States desiring to retire under this section shall certify to the President his disability in writing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an associate justice of the Supreme Court, a chief judge of a circuit or the chief judge of the Court of International Trade, desires to retire under this section, he shall furnish to the President a certificate of disability signed by the Chief Justice of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A circuit or district judge, desiring to retire under this section, shall furnish to the President a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge of his circuit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A judge of the Court of International Trade desiring to retire under this section, shall furnish to the President a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge of his court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Each justice or judge retiring under this section after serving ten years continuously or otherwise shall, during the remainder of his lifetime, receive the salary of the office. A justice or judge retiring under this section who has served less than ten years in all shall, during the remainder of his lifetime, receive one-half the salary of the office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever any judge of the United States appointed to hold office during good behavior who is eligible to retire under this section does not do so and a certificate of his disability signed by a majority of the members of the Judicial Council of his circuit in the case of a circuit or district judge, or by the Chief Justice of the United States in the case of the Chief Judge of the Court of International Trade, or by the chief judge of his court in the case of a judge of the Court of International Trade, is presented to the President and the President finds that such judge is unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent mental or physical disability and that the appointment of an additional judge is necessary for the efficient dispatch of business, the President may make such appointment by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Whenever any such additional judge is appointed, the vacancy subsequently caused by the death, resignation, or retirement of the disabled judge shall not be filled. Any judge whose disability causes the appointment of an additional judge shall, for purpose of precedence, service as chief judge, or temporary performance of the duties of that office, be treated as junior in commission to the other judges of the circuit, district, or court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;375b, 375c, and 375d (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 433, &sect;&sect;1&ndash;3, 53 Stat. 1204, 1205).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates sections 375b, 375c, and 375d of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 375e of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. providing that term &ldquo;senior circuit judge&rdquo; includes the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and the term &ldquo;judicial circuit&rdquo; includes the District of Columbia, was omitted from this revision as unnecessary. Such district is included as a judicial circuit by section 41 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;justice or judge of the United States&rdquo; were used to describe members of all courts who hold office during good behavior. (See reviser's note under section 371 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Term &ldquo;chief judge&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;Chief Justice&rdquo; of the Court of Claims, &ldquo;presiding judge&rdquo; of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and &ldquo;senior circuit judge.&rdquo; (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">For clarity and convenience the requirement that certificates of disability be submitted &ldquo;to the President,&rdquo; was made explicit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section requires a judge of the Customs Court to furnish a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge of his court, instead of by the chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as in said section 375c of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. This change insures signing of the certificate of disability by the chief judge possessing knowledge of the facts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.</p>

Subsection (b) of this section clarifies the intent of section 372 of title 28, U.S.C., and conforms with the language of section 371 of such title.</p>

With the agreement of the judge or magistrate judge involved, a certification under this subsection may be renewed for successive 5-year periods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a certification may be made, in the case of a bankruptcy judge or a United States magistrate,<sup><a href="#375_1_target" name="375_1">1</a></sup> by the judicial council of the circuit in which the official duty station of the judge or magistrate at the time of retirement was located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;bankruptcy judge&rdquo; means a bankruptcy judge appointed under chapter 6 of this title or serving as a bankruptcy judge on March 31, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A judge or magistrate judge recalled under this section may exercise all of the powers and duties of the office of judge or magistrate judge held at the time of retirement, including the ability to serve in any other judicial district to <!-- PDFPage:120 -->the extent applicable, but may not engage in the practice of law or engage in any other business, occupation, or employment inconsistent with the expeditious, proper, and impartial performance of duties as a judicial officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) During the 5-year period in which a certification under subsection (a) is in effect, the judge or magistrate judge involved shall receive, in addition to the annuity provided under the provisions of section 377 of this title or under the applicable provisions of title 5, an amount equal to the difference between that annuity and the current salary of the office to which the judge or magistrate judge is recalled. The annuity of a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who completes that 5-year period of service, whose certification is not renewed, and who retired under section 377 of this title shall be equal to the salary in effect, at the end of that 5-year period, for the office from which he or she retired.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A certification under subsection (a) may be terminated in accordance with chapter 16 of this title, and such a certification shall be terminated upon the death of the recalled judge or magistrate judge involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Except as provided in subsection (c), a judge or magistrate judge recalled under this section who retired under the applicable provisions of title 5 shall be considered to be a reemployed annuitant under chapter 83 or chapter 84, as the case may be, of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the case of the survivor or survivors of a judicial official to whom paragraph (1)(B) applies, there shall be deducted from the annuities otherwise payable under this section an amount equal to the amount of salary deductions that would have been made if such deductions had been made for 18 months prior to the judicial official's death.</p>

The Director may order or direct at any time such medical or other examinations as he deems necessary to determine the facts relative to the nature and degree of disability of any child who is an annuitant, or an applicant for an annuity, under this section, and may suspend or deny any such annuity for failure to submit to any such examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall determine whether the killing of a judicial official was an assassination, subject to review only by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The head of any Federal agency that investigates the killing of a judicial official shall provide information to the Director that would assist the Director in making such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) In any case in which a payment under this section is to be made to a minor, or to a person mentally incompetent or under other legal disability, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, such payment may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary of such claimant by the laws of the State of residence of such claimant, or to any other person who is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or of the claimant's estate, and need not be made directly to such claimant. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may, at his or her discretion, determine whether such payment is made directly to such claimant or to such guardian, fiduciary, or other person legally vested with the care of such claimant or the claimant's estate. Where no guardian or other fiduciary of such minor or such person under legal disability has been appointed under the laws of the State of residence of such claimant, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall determine the person who is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or of the claimant's estate.</p>

The judicial official shall also notify any spouse or former spouse of the application for revocation in accordance with such requirements as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall by regulation prescribe.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge shall be paid to that individual.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notification of a spouse or former spouse under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall by regulation prescribe.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Director shall prescribe regulations under which this paragraph shall be applied in any case in which the Director receives two or more orders or decrees described in subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="note-body">Requirements for printing, binding, and issuing Supreme Court decisions &ldquo;within eight months after said <!-- PDFPage:139 -->decisions have been rendered by the Supreme Court&rdquo; and provision for distribution &ldquo;within said period&rdquo; were omitted. The phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable after rendition&rdquo; was made the time for publishing such decisions as more flexible and practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;the United States Court for China&rdquo; were omitted inasmuch as that court is no longer functioning. The Secretary of State by an arrangement with China has relinquished the extraterritorial jurisdiction previously exercised by the United States in China. The 1944 Legislative and Judiciary Appropriation Act approved June 28, 1943, made no appropriation for the United States Court for China. Appropriations for other courts were made in title II of chapter 173 (57 Stat. 241). The last appropriation for the United States Court for China was in the act of July 2, 1942 (ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 502).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;to the Secretary of War for the use of the proper courts and officers of the Philippine Islands, seven copies&rdquo; were omitted in view of the independence of the Philippines, effective July 4, 1946.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;justice or judge of the United States&rdquo; obviated repetition of names of courts. (See definitive section 451 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Last sentence, fourth paragraph, of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that books should remain the property of the United States and should be preserved and turned over to successors in office, was omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A reference to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by &ldquo;each United States attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision authorizing distribution of volumes under this section to each place where a court of appeals is held was added for purposes of uniformity. See similar provision in section 413 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in lieu of the Attorney General insofar as distribution of volumes to the judiciary is concerned. This change is consistent with the duties of the former under section 601 et seq. of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to the custody, use and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The limitation of 10 copies to the library of the Supreme Court and 6 copies to the marshal of the Supreme Court for use of the justices, was omitted and the provision for distribution in such number &ldquo;specified by the Chief Justice of the United States&rdquo; was substituted therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Acts July 1, 1922, ch. 267, &sect;5, 42 Stat. 818; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, &sect;3, 44 Stat. 678 which is omitted, but not repealed, as unnecessary in this revision.</p>

<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., limiting the price to be paid for volumes of the Federal Reporter and other similar reports were omitted after consultation with the Administrative Office of United States Courts as more properly covered by current appropriation acts.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;financial interest&rdquo; means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a &ldquo;financial interest&rdquo; in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any justice, judge, magistrate judge, or bankruptcy judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her, that he or she individually or as a fiduciary, or his or her spouse or minor child residing in his or her household, has a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the justice, judge, magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, spouse or minor child, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provisions in section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that where court is held &ldquo;at more than one place&rdquo; and the place of keeping the records &ldquo;is not specially provided by law, they shall be kept at either of the places&rdquo; designated by the court, was changed to permit the judicial councils of the circuits to make the determination without requiring special enactment of Congress. See section 332 of this title as to purpose and duties of the judicial councils.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of section 523a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing destruction of records by the Attorney General was rewritten in the second paragraph to give such authority, respecting court records, to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Such Director, under section 604 of this title, now exercises administrative authority over clerks and commissioners.</p>
<p class="note-body">A similar provision with respect to records of United States attorneys and marshals was omitted as superseded by sections 366 and 380 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents, which prescribe the exclusive method for disposition of such papers.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision of section 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., giving to &ldquo;all courts of the United States&rdquo; power to impose and administer all necessary oaths is the only part of such section in this title.

<!-- field-end:amendment-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 102 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;650 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The problems of cost and delay in civil litigation in any United States district court must be addressed in the context of the full range of demands made on the district court's resources by both civil and criminal matters.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The courts, the litigants, the litigants&rsquo; attorneys, and the Congress and the executive branch, share responsibility for cost and delay in civil litigation and its impact on access to the courts, adjudication of cases on the merits, and the ability of the civil justice system to provide proper and timely judicial relief for aggrieved parties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The solutions to problems of cost and delay must include significant contributions by the courts, the litigants, the litigants&rsquo; attorneys, and by the Congress and the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In identifying, developing, and implementing solutions to problems of cost and delay in civil litigation, it is necessary to achieve a method of consultation so that individual judicial officers, litigants, and litigants&rsquo; attorneys who have developed techniques for litigation management and cost and delay reduction can effectively and promptly communicate those techniques to all participants in the civil justice system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Evidence suggests that an effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction program should incorporate several interrelated principles, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the differential treatment of cases that provides for individualized and specific management according to their needs, complexity, duration, and probable litigation careers;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) early involvement of a judicial officer in planning the progress of a case, controlling the discovery process, and scheduling hearings, trials, and other litigation events;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) regular communication between a judicial officer and attorneys during the pretrial process; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) utilization of alternative dispute resolution programs in appropriate cases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Because the increasing volume and complexity of civil and criminal cases imposes increasingly heavy workload burdens on judicial officers, clerks of court, and other court personnel, it is necessary to create an effective administrative structure to ensure ongoing consultation and communication regarding effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction principles and techniques.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In formulating the provisions of its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan, each United States district court, in consultation with an advisory group appointed under section 478 of this title, shall consider and may include the following principles and guidelines of litigation management and cost and delay reduction:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) systematic, differential treatment of civil cases that tailors the level of individualized and case specific management to such criteria as case complexity, the amount of time reasonably needed to prepare the case for trial, and the judicial and other resources required and available for the preparation and disposition of the case;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) early and ongoing control of the pretrial process through involvement of a judicial officer in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assessing and planning the progress of a case;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) setting early, firm trial dates, such that the trial is scheduled to occur within eighteen months after the filing of the complaint, unless a judicial officer certifies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the demands of the case and its complexity make such a trial date incompatible with serving the ends of justice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the trial cannot reasonably be held within such time because of the complexity of the case or the number or complexity of pending criminal cases;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) controlling the extent of discovery and the time for completion of discovery, and ensuring compliance with appropriate requested discovery in a timely fashion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) setting, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for all cases that the court or an individual judicial officer determines are complex and any other appropriate cases, careful and deliberate monitoring through a discovery-case management conference or a series of such conferences at which the presiding judicial officer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) explores the parties&rsquo; receptivity to, and the propriety of, settlement or proceeding with the litigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) identifies or formulates the principal issues in contention and, in appropriate cases, provides for the staged resolution or bifurcation of issues for trial consistent with Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) prepares a discovery schedule and plan consistent with any presumptive time limits that a district court may set for the completion of discovery and with any procedures a district court may develop to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) identify and limit the volume of discovery available to avoid unnecessary or unduly burdensome or expensive discovery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) phase discovery into two or more stages; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) sets, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) encouragement of cost-effective discovery through voluntary exchange of information among litigants and their attorneys and through the use of cooperative discovery devices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) conservation of judicial resources by prohibiting the consideration of discovery motions unless accompanied by a certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the motion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) authorization to refer appropriate cases to alternative dispute resolution programs that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have been designated for use in a district court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the court may make available, including mediation, minitrial, and summary jury trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In formulating the provisions of its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan, each United States district court, in consultation with an advisory group appointed under section 478 of this title, shall consider and may include the following litigation management and cost and delay reduction techniques:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a requirement that counsel for each party to a case jointly present a discovery-case management plan for the case at the initial pretrial conference, or explain the reasons for their failure to do so;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a requirement that each party be represented at each pretrial conference by an attorney who has the authority to bind that party regarding all matters previously identified by the court for discussion at the conference and all reasonably related matters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a requirement that all requests for extensions of deadlines for completion of discovery or for postponement of the trial be signed by the attorney and the party making the request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a neutral evaluation program for the presentation of the legal and factual basis of a case to a neutral court representative selected by the court at a nonbinding conference conducted early in the litigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a requirement that, upon notice by the court, representatives of the parties with authority to bind them in settlement discussions be present or available by telephone during any settlement conference; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such other features as the district court considers appropriate after considering the recommendations of the advisory group referred to in section 472(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Nothing in a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan relating to the settlement authority provisions of this section shall alter or conflict with the authority of the Attorney General to conduct litigation on behalf of the United States, or any delegation of the Attorney General.</p>
