<p class="statutory-body">(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, copyrights and trade-marks. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent, plant variety protection and copyright cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action asserting a claim of unfair competition when joined with a substantial and related claim under the copyright, patent, plant variety protection or trade-mark laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subsections (a) and (b) apply to exclusive rights in mask works under chapter 9 of title 17, and to exclusive rights in designs under chapter 13 of title 17, to the same extent as such subsections apply to copyrights.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;41(7) and 371(5) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;24, par. 7, 256, par. 5, 36 Stat. 1092, 1160).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 41(7) with section 371 (5) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;of any civil action&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;all suits at law or in equity&rdquo; and &ldquo;cases&rdquo; to conform section to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Word &ldquo;patents&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;patent-right&rdquo; in said section 371 (Fifth) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions respecting suits cognizable in district courts, including those of territories and possessions. (See section 34 of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Copyrights.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is added and is intended to avoid &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo; litigation to enforce common-law and statutory copyright, patent, and trade-mark rights by specifically permitting such enforcement in a single civil action in the district court. While this is the rule under Federal decisions, this section would enact it as statutory authority. The problem is discussed at length in <em>Hurn v. Oursler</em> (1933, 53 S.Ct. 586, 289 U.S. 238, 77 L.Ed. 1148) and in <em>Musher Foundation v. Alba Trading Co</em>. (C.C.A. 1942, 127 F.2d 9) (majority and dissenting opinions).</p>
