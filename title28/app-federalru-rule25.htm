<h3 class="section-head">Rule 25. Filing and Service</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Filing.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <strong>Filing with the Clerk.</strong> A paper required or permitted to be filed in a court of appeals must be filed with the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <strong>Filing: Method and Timeliness.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <strong>In general.</strong> Filing may be accomplished by mail addressed to the clerk, but filing is not timely unless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <strong>A brief or appendix.</strong> A brief or appendix is timely filed, however, if on or before the last day for filing, it is:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) mailed to the clerk by First-Class Mail, or other class of mail that is at least as expeditious, postage prepaid; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for delivery to the clerk within 3 calendar days.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <strong>Inmate filing.</strong> A paper filed by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if deposited in the institution's internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <strong>Electronic filing.</strong> A court of appeals may by local rule permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <strong>Filing a Motion with a Judge.</strong> If a motion requests relief that may be granted by a single judge, the judge may permit the motion to be filed with the judge; the judge must note the filing date on the motion and give it to the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <strong>Clerk's Refusal of Documents.</strong> The clerk must not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or by any local rule or practice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Service of All Papers Required.</strong> Unless a rule requires service by the clerk, a party must, at or before the time of filing a paper, serve a copy on the other parties to the appeal or review. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the party's counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Manner of Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Service may be any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) personal, including delivery to a responsible person at the office of counsel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by mail;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 calendar days; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) by electronic means, if the party being served consents in writing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If authorized by local rule, a party may use the court's transmission equipment to make electronic service under Rule 25(c)(1)(D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) When reasonable considering such factors as the immediacy of the relief sought, distance, and cost, service on a party must be by a manner at least as expeditious as the manner used to file the paper with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the carrier. Service by electronic means is complete on transmission, unless the party making service is notified that the paper was not received by the party served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Proof of Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A paper presented for filing must contain either of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) proof of service consisting of a statement by the person who made service certifying:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the date and manner of service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the names of the persons served; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) their mail or electronic addresses, facsimile numbers, or the addresses of the places of delivery, as appropriate for the manner of service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) When a brief or appendix is filed by mailing or dispatch in accordance with Rule 25(a)(2)(B), the proof of service must also state the date and manner by which the document was mailed or dispatched to the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Proof of service may appear on or be affixed to the papers filed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Number of Copies.</strong> When these rules require the filing or furnishing of a number of copies, a <!-- PDFPage:36 -->court may require a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule that filing is not timely unless the papers filed are received within the time allowed is the familiar one. <em>Ward v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co</em>., 265 F.2d 75 (5th Cir., 1959), rev'd on other grounds 362 U.S. 396, 80 S.Ct. 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 820 (1960); <em>Kahler-Ellis Co. v. Ohio Turnpike Commission</em>, 225 F.2d 922 (6th Cir., 1955). An exception is made in the case of briefs and appendices in order to afford the parties the maximum time for their preparation. By the terms of the exception, air mail delivery must be used whenever it is the most expeditious manner of delivery.</p>
<p class="note-body">A majority of the circuits now require service of all papers filed with the clerk. The usual provision in present rules is for service on &ldquo;adverse&rdquo; parties. In view of the extreme simplicity of service by mail, there seems to be no reason why a party who files a paper should not be required to serve all parties to the proceeding in the court of appeals, whether or not they may be deemed adverse. The common requirement of proof of service is retained, but the rule permits it to be made by simple certification, which may be endorsed on the copy which is filed.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rules 25(a) and (b) are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment permits, but does not require, courts of appeals to adopt local rules that allow filing of papers by electronic means. However, courts of appeals cannot adopt such local rules until the Judicial Conference of the United States authorizes filing by facsimile or other electronic means.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment accompanies new subdivision (c) of Rule 4 and extends the holding in <em>Houston v. Lack</em>, 487 U.S. 266 (1988), to all papers filed in the courts of appeals by persons confined in institutions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Several circuits have local rules that authorize the office of the clerk to refuse to accept for filing papers that are not in the form required by these rules or by local rules. This is not a suitable role for the office of the clerk and the practice exposes litigants to the hazards of time bars; for these reasons, such rules are proscribed by this rule. This provision is similar to Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(e) and Fed.R.Bankr.P. 5005.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee wishes to make it clear that the provision prohibiting a clerk from refusing a document does not mean that a clerk's office may no longer screen documents to determine whether they comply with the rules. A court may delegate to the clerk authority to inform a party about any noncompliance with the rules and, if the party is willing to correct the document, to determine a date by which the corrected document must be resubmitted. If a party refuses to take the steps recommended by the clerk or if in the clerk's judgment the party fails to correct the noncompliance, the clerk must refer the matter to the court for a ruling.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Two changes have been made in this subdivision. Subdivision (d) provides that a paper presented for filing must contain proof of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (d) has been deleted as unnecessary. That sentence stated that a clerk could permit papers to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service but must require that it be filed promptly thereafter. In light of the change made in subdivision (a) which states that a clerk may not refuse to accept for filing a document because it is not in the proper form, there is no further need for a provision stating that a clerk may accept a paper lacking a proof of service. The clerk must accept such a paper. That portion of the deleted sentence stating that the clerk must require that proof of service be filed promptly after the filing of the document if the proof is not filed concurrently with the document is also unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second amendment requires that the certificate of service must state the addresses to which the papers were mailed or at which they were delivered. The Federal Circuit has a similar local rule, Fed.Cir.R. 25.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Subdivision (e) is a new subdivision. It makes it clear that whenever these rules require a party to file or furnish a number of copies a court may require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.</p>
<p class="note-body">A party must consult local rules to determine whether the court requires a different number than that specified in these national rules. The Committee believes it would be helpful if each circuit either: 1) included a chart at the beginning of its local rules showing the number of copies of each document required to be filed with the court along with citation to the controlling rule; or 2) made available such a chart to each party upon commencement of an appeal; or both. If a party fails to file the required number of copies, the failure does not create a jurisdictional defect. Rule 3(a) states: &ldquo;Failure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the court of appeals deems appropriate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment deletes the language requiring a party to use &ldquo;the most expeditious form of delivery by mail, except special delivery&rdquo; in order to file a brief using the mailbox rule. That language was adopted before the Postal Service offered Express Mail and other expedited delivery services. The amendment makes it clear that it is sufficient to use First-Class Mail. Other equally or more expeditious classes of mail service, such as Express Mail, also may be used. In addition, the amendment permits the use of commercial carriers. The use of private, overnight courier services has become commonplace in law practice. Expedited services offered by commercial carriers often provide faster delivery than First-Class Mail; therefore, there should be no objection to the use of commercial carriers as long as they are reliable. In order to make use of the mailbox rule when using a commercial carrier, the amendment requires that the filer employ a carrier who undertakes to deliver the document in no more than three calendar days. The three-calendar-day period coordinates with the three-day extension provided by Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment permits service by commercial carrier if the carrier is to deliver the paper <!-- PDFPage:37 -->to the party being served within three days of the carrier's receipt of the paper. The amendment also expresses a desire that when reasonable, service on a party be accomplished by a manner as expeditious as the manner used to file the paper with the court. When a brief or motion is filed with the court by hand delivering the paper to the clerk's office, or by overnight courier, the copies should be served on the other parties by an equally expeditious manner&mdash;meaning either by personal service, if distance permits, or by overnight courier, if mail delivery to the party is not ordinarily accomplished overnight. The reasonableness standard is included so that if a paper is hand delivered to the clerk's office for filing but the other parties must be served in a different city, state, or region, personal service on them ordinarily will not be expected. If use of an equally expeditious manner of service is not reasonable, use of the next most expeditious manner may be. For example, if the paper is filed by hand delivery to the clerk's office but the other parties reside in distant cities, service on them need not be personal but in most instances should be by overnight courier. Even that may not be required, however, if the number of parties that must be served would make the use of overnight service too costly. A factor that bears upon the reasonableness of serving parties expeditiously is the immediacy of the relief requested.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The amendment adds a requirement that when a brief or appendix is filed by mail or commercial carrier, the certificate of service state the date and manner by which the document was mailed or dispatched to the clerk. Including that information in the certificate of service avoids the necessity for a separate certificate concerning the date and manner of filing.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; a substantive amendment is made, however, in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (a).</strong> The substantive amendment in this subdivision is in subparagraph (a)(2)(C) and is a companion to an amendment in Rule 4(c). Currently Rule 25(a)(2)(C) provides that if an inmate confined in an institution files a document by depositing it in the institution's internal mail system, the document is timely filed if deposited on or before the last day for filing. Some institutions have special internal mail systems for handling legal mail; such systems often record the date of deposit of mail by an inmate, the date of delivery of mail to an inmate, etc. The Advisory Committee amends the rule to require an inmate to use the system designed for legal mail, if there is one, in order to receive the benefit of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 25(a)(2)(D) presently authorizes the courts of appeals to permit papers to be <em>filed</em> by electronic means. Rule 25 has been amended in several respects to permit papers also to be <em>served</em> electronically. In addition, Rule 25(c) has been reorganized and subdivided to make it easier to understand.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(1)(D).</em> New subdivision (c)(1)(D) has been added to permit service to be made electronically, such as by e-mail or fax. No party may be served electronically, either by the clerk or by another party, unless the party has consented in writing to such service.</p>
<p class="note-body">A court of appeals may not, by local rule, forbid the use of electronic service on a party that has consented to its use. At the same time, courts have considerable discretion to use local rules to regulate electronic service. Difficult and presently unforeseeable questions are likely to arise as electronic service becomes more common. Courts have the flexibility to use their local rules to address those questions. For example, courts may use local rules to set forth specific procedures that a party must follow before the party will be deemed to have given written consent to electronic service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Parties also have the flexibility to define the terms of their consent; a party's consent to electronic service does not have to be &ldquo;all-or-nothing.&rdquo; For example, a party may consent to service by facsimile transmission, but not by electronic mail; or a party may consent to electronic service only if &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; copies of all transmissions are mailed within 24 hours; or a party may consent to electronic service of only documents that were created with Corel WordPerfect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(2).</em> The courts of appeals are authorized under Rule 25(a)(2)(D) to permit papers to be filed electronically. Technological advances may someday make it possible for a court to forward an electronically filed paper to all parties automatically or semi-automatically. When such court-facilitated service becomes possible, courts may decide to permit parties to use the courts&rsquo; transmission facilities to serve electronically filed papers on other parties who have consented to such service. Court personnel would use the court's computer system to forward the papers, but the papers would be considered served by the filing parties, just as papers that are carried from one address to another by the United States Postal Service are considered served by the sending parties. New subdivision (c)(2) has been added so that the courts of appeals may use local rules to authorize such use of their transmission facilities, as well as to address the many questions that court-facilitated electronic service is likely to raise.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(4).</em> The second sentence of new subdivision (c)(4) has been added to provide that electronic service is complete upon transmission. Transmission occurs when the sender performs the last act that he or she must perform to transmit a paper electronically; typically, it occurs when the sender hits the &ldquo;send&rdquo; or &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; button on an electronic mail program. There is one exception to the rule that electronic service is complete upon transmission: If the sender is notified&mdash;by the sender's e-mail program or otherwise&mdash;that the paper was not received, service is not complete, and the sender must take additional steps to effect service. A paper has been &ldquo;received&rdquo; by the party on which it has been served as long as the party has the ability to retrieve it. A party cannot defeat service by choosing not to access electronic mail on its server.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment. A paragraph was added to the Committee Note to clarify that consent to electronic service is not an &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; matter.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(1)(B)(iii).</em> Subdivision (d)(1)(B)(iii) has been amended to require that, when a paper is served electronically, the proof of service of that paper must include the electronic address or facsimile number to which the paper was transmitted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> The text of the proposed amendment was changed to refer to &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; addresses (instead of to &ldquo;e-mail&rdquo; addresses), to include &ldquo;facsimile numbers,&rdquo; and to add the concluding phrase &ldquo;as appropriate for the manner of service.&rdquo; Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.</p>
