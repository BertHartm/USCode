<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Consolidation</cap-smallcap>. When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Separate Trials</cap-smallcap>. The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate the right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is based upon U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;734 (Orders to save costs; consolidation of causes of like nature) but insofar as the statute differs from this rule, it is modified.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:212 --><p class="note-body">For comparable statutes dealing with consolidation see Ark.Dig.Stat. (Crawford & Moses, 1921) &sect;1081; Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;1048; N.M.Stat.Ann. (Courtright, 1929) &sect;105&ndash;828; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;96, 96a, and 97; American Judicature Society, Bulletin XIV (1919) Art.26.</p>
<p class="note-body">For severance or separate trials see Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;1048; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;96; American Judicature Society, Bulletin XIV (1919) Art. 3, &sect;2 and Art. 10, &sect;10. See also the third sentence of Equity Rule 29 (Defenses&mdash;How Presented) providing for discretionary separate hearing and disposition before trial of pleas in bar or abatement, and see also Rule 12(d) of these rules for preliminary hearings of defenses and objections.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the entry of separate judgments, see Rule 54(b) (Judgment at Various Stages).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In certain suits in admiralty separation for trial of the issues of liability and damages (or of the extent of liability other than damages, such as salvage and general average) has been conducive to expedition and economy, especially because of the statutory right to interlocutory appeal in admiralty cases (which is of course preserved by these Rules). While separation of issues for trial is not to be routinely ordered, it is important that it be encouraged where experience has demonstrated its worth. Cf. Weinstein, <em>Routine Bifurcation of Negligence Trials</em>, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 831 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">In cases (including some cases within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction) in which the parties have a constitutional or statutory right of trial by jury, separation of issues may give rise to problems. See <em>e.g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. Wiener</em>, 286 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1961). Accordingly, the proposed change in Rule 42 reiterates the mandate of Rule 38 respecting preservation of the right to jury trial.</p>
