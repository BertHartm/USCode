<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday,<sup><a href="#Rule_6_1_target" name="Rule_6_1">1</a></sup> or when the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court, a day <!-- PDFPage:505 -->on which weather or other conditions have made the office of the clerk inaccessible, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Extension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of the court, an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court may upon motion, for good cause shown, order the period extended; but it may not extend the time for taking any action under Rules 50(b) and (c)(2), 52(b), 59(b), (d) and (e), and 60(b), except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The motion for extension of time must set forth the specific number of additional days requested, the date to which the extension is to run, the extent to which the time for the performance of the particular act has been previously extended, and the reason or reasons upon which the motion is based. The motion shall be filed prior to the expiration of the period allowed for the performance of the act to which the motion relates (including any previous extension of time); except, when for good cause shown, the delay in filing was the result of excusable neglect or circumstances beyond the control of the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No disposition shall be made until the court acts upon the motion for extension of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Additional Time After Service by Mail. Whenever a party has the right or obligation to do some act or take some proceeding within a prescribed or allowed period after the service of a pleading, motion, or other paper upon the party, and the service is made by mail, 5 days shall be added to the prescribed or allowed period.</p>
