<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Powers; Procedure</cap-smallcap>. When specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by local rule or order of the district court and when all parties consent thereto, a magistrate judge may exercise the authority provided by Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;636(c) and may conduct any or all proceedings, including a jury or nonjury trial, in a civil case. A record of the proceedings shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Consent</cap-smallcap>. When a magistrate judge has been designated to exercise civil trial jurisdiction, the clerk shall give written notice to the parties of their opportunity to consent to the exercise by a magistrate judge of civil jurisdiction over the case, as authorized by Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;636(c). If, within the period specified by local rule, the parties agree to a magistrate judge's exercise of such authority, they shall execute and file a joint form of consent or separate forms of consent setting forth such election.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A district judge, magistrate judge, or other court official may again advise the parties of the availability of the magistrate judge, but, in so doing, shall also advise the parties that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences. A district judge or magistrate judge shall not be informed of a party's response to the clerk's notification, unless all parties have consented to the referral of the matter to a magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The district judge, for good cause shown on the judge's own initiative, or under extraordinary circumstances shown by a party, may vacate a reference of a civil matter to a magistrate judge under this subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appeal</cap-smallcap>. In accordance with Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(3), appeal from a judgment entered upon direction of a magistrate judge in proceedings under this rule will lie to the court of appeals as it would from a judgment of the district court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision implements the broad authority of the 1979 amendments to the Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c), which permit a magistrate to sit in lieu of a district judge and exercise civil jurisdiction over a case, when the parties consent. See McCabe, <em>The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979</em>, 16 Harv. J. Legis. 343, 364&ndash;79 (1979). In order to exercise this jurisdiction, a magistrate must be specially designated under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(1) by the district court or courts he serves. The only exception to a magistrate's exercise of civil jurisdiction, which includes the power to conduct jury and nonjury trials and decide dispositive motions, is the contempt power. A hearing on contempt is to be conducted by the district judge upon certification of the facts and an order to show cause by the magistrate. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;639(e). In view of 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(1) and this rule, it is unnecessary to amend Rule 58 to provide that the decision of a magistrate is a &ldquo;decision by the court&rdquo; for the purposes of that rule and a &ldquo;final decision of the district court&rdquo; for purposes of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1291 governing appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This subdivision implements the blind consent provision of 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(2) and is designed to ensure that neither the judge nor the magistrate attempts to induce a party to consent to reference of a civil matter under this rule to a magistrate. See House Rep. No. 96&ndash;444, 96th Cong. 1st Sess. 8 (1979).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule opts for a uniform approach in implementing the consent provision by directing the clerk to notify the parties of their opportunity to elect to proceed before a magistrate and by requiring the execution and filing of a consent form or forms setting forth the election. However, flexibility at the local level is preserved in that local rules will determine how notice shall be communicated to the parties, and local rules will specify the time period within which an election must be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last paragraph of subdivision (b) reiterates the provision in 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(6) for vacating a reference to the magistrate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(3), the normal route of appeal from the judgment of a magistrate&mdash;the only route that will be available unless the parties otherwise agree in advance&mdash;is an appeal by the aggrieved party &ldquo;directly to the appropriate United States court of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court.&rdquo; The quoted statutory language indicates Congress&rsquo; intent that the same procedures and standards of appealability that govern appeals from district court judgments govern appeals from magistrates&rsquo; judgments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(4) offers parties who consent to the exercise of civil jurisdiction by a magistrate an alternative appeal route to that provided in subdivision (c) of this rule. This optional appellate route was provided by Congress in recognition of the fact that not all civil cases warrant the same appellate treatment. In cases where the amount in controversy is not great and there are no difficult questions of law to be resolved, the parties may desire to avoid the expense and delay of appeal to the court of appeals by electing an appeal to the district judge. See McCabe, <em>The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979</em>, 16 Harv. J. Legis. 343, 388 (1979). This subdivision provides that the parties may elect the optional appeal route at the time of reference to a magistrate. To this end, the notice by the clerk under subdivision (b) of this rule shall explain the appeal option and the corollary restriction on review by the court of appeals. This approach will avoid later claims of lack of consent to the avenue of appeal. The choice of the alternative appeal route to the judge of the district court should be made by the parties in their forms of consent. Special appellate rules to govern appeals from a magistrate to a district judge appear in new Rules 74 through 76.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This revision is made to conform the rule to changes made by the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990. The Act requires that, when being reminded of the availability of a magistrate judge, the parties be advised that withholding of consent will have no &ldquo;adverse substantive consequences.&rdquo; They may, however, be advised if the withholding of consent will have the adverse procedural consequence of a potential delay in trial.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996 repealed the former provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(4) and (5) that enabled parties that had agreed to trial before a magistrate judge to agree also that appeal should be taken to the district court. Rule 73 is amended to conform to this change. Rules 74, 75, and 76 are abrogated for the same reason. The portions of Form 33 and Form 34 that referred to appeals to the district court also are deleted.</p>
