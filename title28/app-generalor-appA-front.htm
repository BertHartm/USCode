<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Appendix A represents the court's standard pretrial order. The case management procedures contained in Appendix A reflect those procedures that are considered, in the collective experience of the court and the members of its bar, to be most beneficial in securing the prompt and expeditious resolution of claims and disputes. Some important changes have been introduced. Chief among these are procedures calling for a preliminary scheduling conference to be set following the filing of the Joint Preliminary Status Report, and a post-discovery conference following the completion of discovery. The expectation reflected in these conference procedures is that early and ongoing involvement of the court during the pretrial development of a case can contribute both to a prompt identification of the issues and to a narrowing of the scope of the dispute.</p>
<p class="note-body">The promulgation of Appendix A as a synthesis of the views of the bench and the bar is intended to encourage standardization in pretrial practice procedures. Appendix A recognizes, however, that the pretrial procedures to be followed in any particular case ultimately depend upon the needs of that case. Hence, Appendix A permits modification of its procedures, either at a judge's initiative or at the parties&rsquo; suggestion, when such modification will promote the efficient administration of justice.</p>
