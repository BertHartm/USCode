<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Separate Document.</cap-smallcap> Every judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document, but a separate document is not required for an order disposing of a motion:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for judgment under Rule 50(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 52(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for attorney's fees under Rule 54;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for a new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment, under Rule 59; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) for relief under Rule 60.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Entering Judgment.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Without the Court's Direction.</em> Subject to Rule 54(b) and unless the court orders otherwise, the clerk must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment when:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the jury returns a general verdict;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the court awards only costs or a sum certain; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the court denies all relief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Court's Approval Required.</em> Subject to Rule 54(b), the court must promptly approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the jury returns a special verdict or a general verdict with answers to written questions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the court grants other relief not described in this subdivision (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Time of Entry.</cap-smallcap> For purposes of these rules, judgment is entered at the following times:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if a separate document is not required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a separate document is required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a) and the earlier of these events occurs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is set out in a separate document; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 150 days have run from the entry in the civil docket.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Request for Entry.</cap-smallcap> A party may request that judgment be set out in a separate document as required by Rule 58(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Cost or Fee Awards.</cap-smallcap> Ordinarily, the entry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. But if a timely motion for attorney's <!-- PDFPage:263 -->fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) as a timely motion under Rule 59.</p>

<p class="note-body">See Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;270.31 (judgment entered forthwith on verdict of jury unless otherwise ordered), &sect;270.65 (where trial is by the court, entered by direction of the court), &sect;270.63 (entered by clerk on judgment on admitted claim for money). Compare 1 Idaho Code Ann. (1932) &sect;7&ndash;1101, and 4 Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. (1935) &sect;9403, which provides that judgment in jury cases be entered by clerk within 24 hours after verdict unless court otherwise directs. Conn. Practice Book (1934) &sect;200, provides that all judgments shall be entered within one week after rendition. In some States such as Washington, 2 Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;431, in jury cases the judgment is entered two days after the return of verdict to give time for making motion for new trial; &sect;435 (<em>ibid</em>.), provides that all judgments shall be entered by the clerk, subject to the court's direction.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The reference to Rule 54(b) is made necessary by the amendment of that rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two changes have been made in Rule 58 in order to clarify the practice. The substitution of the more inclusive phrase &ldquo;all relief be denied&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;there be no recovery&rdquo;, makes it clear that the clerk shall enter the judgment forthwith in the situations specified without awaiting the filing of a formal judgment approved by the court. The phrase &ldquo;all relief be denied&rdquo; covers cases such as the denial of a bankrupt's discharge and similar situations where the relief sought is refused but there is literally no denial of a &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The addition of the last sentence in the rule emphasizes that judgments are to be entered promptly by the clerk without waiting for the taxing of costs. Certain district court rules, for example, Civil Rule 22 of the Southern District of New York&mdash;until its annulment Oct. 1, 1945, for conflict with this rule&mdash;and the like rule of the Eastern District of New York, are expressly in conflict with this provision, although the federal law is of long standing and well settled. <em>Fowler v. Hamill</em> (1891) 139 U.S. 549; <em>Craig v. The Hartford</em> (C.C.Cal. 1856) Fed.Case No. 3,333; <em>Tuttle v. Claflin</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1895) 60 Fed. 7, cert. den. (1897) 166 U.S. 721; <em>Prescott & A. C. Ry. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1897) 84 Fed. 213; <em>Stallo v. Wagner</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1917) 245 Fed. 636, 639&ndash;40; <em>Brown v. Parker</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1899) 97 Fed. 446; <em>Allis-Chalmers v. United States</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1908) 162 Fed. 679. And this applies even though state law is to the contrary. <em>United States v. Nordbye</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1935) 75 F.(2d) 744, 746, cert. den. (1935) 296 U.S. 572. Inasmuch as it has been held that failure of the clerk thus enter judgment is a &ldquo;misprision&rdquo; &ldquo;not to be excused&rdquo; <em>(The Washington</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1926) 16 F.(2d) 206), such a district court rule may have serious consequences for a district court clerk. Rules of this sort also provide for delay in entry of the judgment contrary to Rule 58. See <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bedford's Estate</em> (1945) 325 U.S. 283.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the present rule a distinction has sometimes been made between judgments on general jury verdicts, on the one hand, and, on the other, judgments upon decisions of the court that a party shall recover only money or costs or that all relief shall be denied. In the first situation, it is clear that the clerk should enter the judgment without awaiting a direction by the court unless the court otherwise orders. In the second situation it was intended that the clerk should similarly enter the judgment forthwith upon the court's decision; but because of the separate listing in the rule, and the use of the phrase &ldquo;upon receipt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the direction,&rdquo; the rule has sometimes been interpreted as requiring the clerk to await a separate direction of the court. All these judgments are usually uncomplicated, and should be handled in the same way. The amended rule accordingly deals with them as a single group in clause (1) (substituting the expression &ldquo;only a sum certain&rdquo; for the present expression &ldquo;only money&rdquo;), and requires the clerk to prepare, sign, and enter them forthwith, without awaiting court direction, unless the court makes a contrary order. (The clerk's duty is ministerial and may be performed by a deputy clerk in the name of the clerk. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;956; <em>cf. Gilbertson v. United States</em>, 168 Fed. 672 (7th Cir. 1909).) The more complicated judgments described in clause (2) must be approved by the court before they are entered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58 is designed to encourage all reasonable speed in formulating and entering the judgment when the case has been decided. Participation by the attorneys through the submission of forms of judgment involves needless expenditure of time and effort and promotes delay, except in special cases where counsel's assistance can be of real value. See <em>Matteson v. United States</em>, 240 F.2d 517, 518&ndash;19 (2d Cir. 1956). Accordingly, the amended rule provides that attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment unless directed to do so by the court. This applies to the judgments mentioned in clause (2) as well as clause (1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Hitherto some difficulty has arisen, chiefly where the court has written an opinion or memorandum containing some apparently directive or dispositive words, e.g., &ldquo;the plaintiff's motion [for summary judgment] is granted,&rdquo; see <em>United States v. F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co</em>., 356 U.S. 227, 229, 78 S.Ct. 674, 2 L.Ed.2d 721 (1958). Clerks on occasion have viewed these opinions or memoranda as being in themselves a sufficient basis for entering judgment in the civil docket as provided by Rule 79(a). However, where the opinion or memorandum has not contained all the elements of a judgment, or where the judge has later signed a formal judgment, it has become a matter of doubt whether the purported entry of judgment was effective, starting the time running for postverdict motions and for the purpose of appeal. See <em>id.;</em> and <em>compare Blanchard v. Commonwealth Oil Co</em>., 294 F.2d 834 (5th Cir. 1961); <em>United States v. Higginson</em>, 238 F.2d 439 (1st Cir. 1956); <em>Danzig v. Virgin Isle Hotel, Inc</em>., 278 F.2d 580 (3d Cir. 1960); <em>Sears v. Austin</em>, 282 F.2d 340 (9th Cir. 1960), with <em>Matteson v. United States, supra; Erstling v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co</em>., 255 F.2d 93 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Barta v. Oglala Sioux Tribe</em>, 259 F.2d 553 (8th Cir. 1958), <em>cert. denied</em>, 358 U.S. 932, 79 S.Ct. 320, 3 L.Ed.2d 304 (1959); <em>Beacon Fed. S. & L. Assn. v. Federal Home L. Bank Bd</em>., 266 F.2d 246 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 823, 80 S.Ct. 70, 4 L.Ed.2d 67 (1959); <em>Ram v. Paramount Film D. Corp</em>., 278 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule eliminates these uncertainties by requiring that there be a judgment set out on a separate document&mdash;distinct from any opinion or memorandum&mdash;which provides the basis for the entry of judgment. That judgments shall be on separate documents is also indicated in Rule 79(b); and see General Rule 10 of the U.S. District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York; <em>Ram v. Paramount Film D. Corp., supra</em>, at 194.</p>
<p class="note-body">See the amendment of Rule 79(a) and the new specimen forms of judgment, Forms 31 and 32.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also Rule 55(b)(1) and (2) covering the subject of judgments by default.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ordinarily the pendency or post-judgment filing of a claim for attorney's fees will not affect the time for ap<!-- PDFPage:264 -->peal from the underlying judgment. <em>See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co</em>., 486 U.S. 196 (1988). Particularly if the claim for fees involves substantial issues or is likely to be affected by the appellate decision, the district court may prefer to defer consideration of the claim for fees until after the appeal is resolved. However, in many cases it may be more efficient to decide fee questions before an appeal is taken so that appeals relating to the fee award can be heard at the same time as appeals relating to the merits of the case. This revision permits, but does not require, the court to delay the finality of the judgment for appellate purposes under revised Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) until the fee dispute is decided. To accomplish this result requires entry of an order by the district court before the time a notice of appeal becomes effective for appellate purposes. If the order is entered, the motion for attorney's fees is treated in the same manner as a timely motion under Rule 59.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58 has provided that a judgment is effective only when set forth on a separate document and entered as provided in Rule 79(a). This simple separate document requirement has been ignored in many cases. The result of failure to enter judgment on a separate document is that the time for making motions under Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, and some motions under Rule 60, never begins to run. The time to appeal under Appellate Rule 4(a) also does not begin to run. There have been few visible problems with respect to Rule 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, or 60 motions, but there have been many and horridly confused problems under Appellate Rule 4(a). These amendments are designed to work in conjunction with Appellate Rule 4(a) to ensure that appeal time does not linger on indefinitely, and to maintain the integration of the time periods set for Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, and 60 with Appellate Rule 4(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58(a) preserves the core of the present separate document requirement, both for the initial judgment and for any amended judgment. No attempt is made to sort through the confusion that some courts have found in addressing the elements of a separate document. It is easy to prepare a separate document that recites the terms of the judgment without offering additional explanation or citation of authority. Forms 31 and 32 provide examples.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58 is amended, however, to address a problem that arises under Appellate Rule 4(a). Some courts treat such orders as those that deny a motion for new trial as a &ldquo;judgment,&rdquo; so that appeal time does not start to run until the order is entered on a separate document. Without attempting to address the question whether such orders are appealable, and thus judgments as defined by Rule 54(a), the amendment provides that entry on a separate document is not required for an order disposing of the motions listed in Appellate Rule 4(a). The enumeration of motions drawn from the Appellate Rule 4(a) list is generalized by omitting details that are important for appeal time purposes but that would unnecessarily complicate the separate document requirement. As one example, it is not required that any of the enumerated motions be timely. Many of the enumerated motions are frequently made before judgment is entered. The exemption of the order disposing of the motion does not excuse the obligation to set forth the judgment itself on a separate document. And if disposition of the motion results in an amended judgment, the amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58(b) discards the attempt to define the time when a judgment becomes &ldquo;effective.&rdquo; Taken in conjunction with the Rule 54(a) definition of a judgment to include &ldquo;any order from which an appeal lies,&rdquo; the former Rule 58 definition of effectiveness could cause strange difficulties in implementing pretrial orders that are appealable under interlocutory appeal provisions or under expansive theories of finality. Rule 58(b) replaces the definition of effectiveness with a new provision that defines the time when judgment is entered. If judgment is promptly set forth on a separate document, as should be done when required by Rule 58(a)(1), the new provision will not change the effect of Rule 58. But in the cases in which court and clerk fail to comply with this simple requirement, the motion time periods set by Rules 50, 52, 54, 59, and 60 begin to run after expiration of 150 days from entry of the judgment in the civil docket as required by Rule 79(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">A companion amendment of Appellate Rule 4(a)(7) integrates these changes with the time to appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new all-purpose definition of the entry of judgment must be applied with common sense to other questions that may turn on the time when judgment is entered. If the 150-day provision in Rule 58(b)(2)(B)&mdash;designed to integrate the time for post-judgment motions with appeal time&mdash;serves no purpose, or would defeat the purpose of another rule, it should be disregarded. In theory, for example, the separate document requirement continues to apply to an interlocutory order that is appealable as a final decision under collateral-order doctrine. Appealability under collateral-order doctrine should not be complicated by failure to enter the order as a judgment on a separate document&mdash;there is little reason to force trial judges to speculate about the potential appealability of every order, and there is no means to ensure that the trial judge will always reach the same conclusion as the court of appeals. Appeal time should start to run when the collateral order is entered without regard to creation of a separate document and without awaiting expiration of the 150 days provided by Rule 58(b)(2). Drastic surgery on Rules 54(a) and 58 would be required to address this and related issues, however, and it is better to leave this conundrum to the pragmatic disregard that seems its present fate. The present amendments do not seem to make matters worse, apart from one false appearance. If a pretrial order is set forth on a separate document that meets the requirements of Rule 58(b), the time to move for reconsideration seems to begin to run, perhaps years before final judgment. And even if there is no separate document, the time to move for reconsideration seems to begin 150 days after entry in the civil docket. This apparent problem is resolved by Rule 54(b), which expressly permits revision of all orders not made final under Rule 54(b) &ldquo;at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 58(d) replaces the provision that attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment except on direction of the court. This provision was added to Rule 58 to avoid the delays that were frequently encountered by the former practice of directing the attorneys for the prevailing party to prepare a form of judgment, and also to avoid the occasionally inept drafting that resulted from attorney-prepared judgments. See <em>11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 2d, &sect;2786</em>. The express direction in Rule 58(a)(2) for prompt action by the clerk, and by the court if court action is required, addresses this concern. The new provision allowing any party to move for entry of judgment on a separate document will protect all needs for prompt commencement of the periods for motions, appeals, and execution or other enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> Minor style changes were made. The definition of the time of entering judgment in Rule 58(b) was extended to reach all Civil Rules, not only the Rules described in the published version&mdash;Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, 60, and 62. And the time of entry was extended from 60 days to 150 days after entry in the civil docket without a required separate document.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 58 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
