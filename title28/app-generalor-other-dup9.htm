<h3 class="section-head">Rule 77. Court and Clerk</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Court Always Open.</strong> The court shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing any pleading or other proper paper, of issuing and returning process, and of making and directing all interlocutory motions, orders, and rules.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:432 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Trials and Hearings; Proceedings in Chambers.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Proceedings Generally.</strong> All trials upon the merits shall be conducted in open court and so far as convenient in a regular courtroom. All other acts or proceedings may be done or conducted by a judge in chambers, without the attendance of the clerk or other court officials or at any other place designated by order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Trials or Hearings in Foreign Countries.</strong> Upon motion of a party or upon the judge's own initiative, and upon a determination by the judge to whom the case is assigned that the interests of economy, efficiency, and justice will be served, the chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims may issue an order authorizing a judge of the court to conduct proceedings, including evidentiary hearings and trials, in a foreign country whose laws do not prohibit such proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Clerk's Office and Orders by Clerk.</strong> The clerk's office with the clerk or a deputy in attendance shall be open during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and the following holidays: New Year's Day, Inauguration Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and any other day designated as a holiday by the President or the Congress of the United States. All motions and applications in the clerk's office for issuing process, process to enforce and execute judgments, for entering defaults or judgments by default, and for other proceedings which do not require allowance or order of the court are grantable of course by the clerk; but the clerk's action may be suspended or altered or rescinded by the court upon cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Notice of Orders or Judgments.</strong> Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice of the entry in the manner provided for in RCFC 5 upon each party who is not in default for failure to appear and shall make a note in the docket of the service. Any party may in addition serve a notice of such entry in the manner provided in RCFC 5 for the service of papers. Lack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in Rule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">In order to more closely parallel the structure and content of FRCP 77, RCFC 77 has been modified as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivisions (a) (referring to the court's &ldquo;Name&rdquo;), (b) (referring to the court's &ldquo;Seal&rdquo;), (d) (captioned &ldquo;Citations&rdquo;) and (e) (identifying the court's judicial power as being exercisable by a single judge, except in congressional reference cases), have been deleted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) (formerly subdivision (h) of this rule) is changed in two respects. First, in order better to reflect its content, the subdivision is retitled to read &ldquo;Trials and Hearings; Proceedings in Chambers&rdquo; (in lieu of &ldquo;Trials and Hearings; Orders in Chambers&rdquo;). Second, the subdivision has been divided into paragraphs (1) and (2). Paragraph (1), captioned &ldquo;Proceedings Generally,&rdquo; retains the rule's earlier language; paragraph (2), captioned &ldquo;Trials or Hearings in Foreign Countries,&rdquo; is new. Paragraph (2) was added to recognize the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. &sect;798(b) to conduct trials or hearings in foreign countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (f) (titled &ldquo;Assignment of Cases&rdquo;) was renumbered as RCFC 40.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (g) (titled &ldquo;Signing of Orders for Absent Judges&rdquo;) was renumbered as RCFC 77.2(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivisions (<em>l</em>) & (k) (titled, respectively, &ldquo;Scheduling Courtrooms&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fee Schedule&rdquo;), were renumbered as RCFC 77.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, former subdivision (m) was deleted in order to recognize the right of certain court employees to participate in pro bono legal work under the guidelines prescribed for that purpose by the Codes of Conduct for Judicial Employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Withdrawal for Trial.</strong> The reporter engaged to transcribe the evidence may temporarily withdraw all papers and exhibits for use during any trial session. All exhibits admitted into evidence or designated to accompany the transcript shall remain in the reporter's custody until the transcript of the court session is filed with the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Withdrawal of Papers and Exhibits.</strong> No papers or exhibits filed with the court shall be temporarily or permanently withdrawn from the office or custody of the clerk except by order of the court. No such order will be entered except in extraordinary circumstances. In the event of such withdrawal, a record of the filing and the order of withdrawal shall be preserved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Disposition of Physical Exhibits.</strong> All physical exhibits, including models, diagrams, depositions, transcripts, briefs, tables, and charts shall be removed from the clerk's custody by the party by whom they were produced or offered within sixty (60) days after the entry of final judgment by this court, or, in the event of an appeal, within ninety (90) days after the receipt and filing of a mandate or other process or certificate showing the disposition of the case by the appellate court; otherwise, such exhibits shall be deemed abandoned and shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Sealed Materials.</strong> Unless otherwise specified by order, no earlier than five years after the entry of final judgment by this court, or, in the event of appeal, within five years after the receipt and filing of a mandate or other process or certificate showing disposition of the case by the appellate court, the clerk may notify the parties that materials maintained under seal shall be unsealed, absent timely notice of objection by either party.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule has no FRCP counterpart. The rule has been amended in several respects:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, former subdivision (a) was deleted, thereby eliminating the practice of permitting temporary withdrawal of exhibits and papers by the parties. The need to accommodate the copying of extensive parts of a record should be addressed directly through arrangements made by the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a), formerly subdivision (b), was amended to clarify that the reporter is to retain custody of the transcript and exhibits until they are filed with the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (b), formerly subdivision (c), clarifies that no withdrawal of papers or exhibits from the clerk's office may occur in the absence of a court order, and then only in extraordinary circumstances. The fact of withdrawal shall be preserved in the court's docketing entries.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (c), formerly subdivision (d), was rewritten to clarify the practice with respect to the disposition of physical exhibits and to make clear the parties&rsquo; obligation to retrieve such exhibits, to avoid their loss through routine disposal. The reference to <em>in camera</em> materials was omitted, because such materials are not filed with the Office of the Clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (d) establishes a procedure for handling materials filed under seal, requiring the parties affirmatively to indicate a desire to maintain filings in closed cases under seal.</p>

The pages shall be numbered consecutively, with a minimum of 25 lines per page. It is not necessary for the witnesses to sign the transcripts of their testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Exhibits.</strong> All exhibits offered by either of the parties shall bear the caption and number of the case, the exhibit numbers, in figures, whether for plaintiff or defendant unless the court provides for the offering parties to otherwise designate their exhibits, and the number of sheets in each exhibit. All exhibits admitted in evidence or designated to accompany the transcript shall accompany and be filed with the transcript of the testimony, but shall not be affixed thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Certificate of Reporter.</strong> The reporter shall append to the transcript of the testimony a certificate similar to Appendix of Forms (Forms 3A and 3B). The certificate shall be signed by the reporter.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 80.1 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule's principal text formerly appeared in these rules as Appendix A. The incorporation of former Appendix A into the main body of the rules reflects a more logical placement of its subject matter in the organizational structure of the court's rules. Additionally, as part of this rule's relocation, Forms A and B of former Appendix A (pertaining to reporter certifications) were assigned to the new Appendix of Forms. They appear there as Forms 3A and 3B.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes introduced in this rule include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) of the rule formerly appeared in these rules as paragraph (b)(1) of RCFC 39. The changes introduced in new subdivision (a) were deemed necessary in order to eliminate uncertainty as to the court's authority to furnish a reporter for trials scheduled outside of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subdivision (i) of the rule formerly appeared as paragraph (b)(3) of RCFC 39. Additionally, subdivision (i) reflects the change in the court's name.</p>
