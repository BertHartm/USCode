<h3 class="section-head">Rule 29. Brief of an Amicus Curiae</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>When Permitted.</cap-smallcap> The United States or its officer or agency, or a State, Territory, Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia may file an amicus-curiae brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have consented to its filing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Motion for Leave to File.</cap-smallcap> The motion must be accompanied by the proposed brief and state:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the movant's interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reason why an amicus brief is desirable and why the matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of the case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contents and Form.</cap-smallcap> An amicus brief must comply with Rule 32. In addition to the requirements of Rule 32, the cover must identify the party or parties supported and indicate whether the brief supports affirmance or reversal. If an amicus curiae is a corporation, the brief must include a disclosure statement like that required of parties by Rule 26.1. An amicus brief need not comply with Rule 28, but must include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a table of contents, with page references;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a table of authorities&mdash;cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes and other authorities&mdash;with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a concise statement of the identity of the amicus curiae, its interest in the case, and the source of its authority to file;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and which need not include a statement of the applicable standard of review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 32(a)(7).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Length.</cap-smallcap> Except by the court's permission, an amicus brief may be no more than one-half the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief. If the court grants a party permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect the length of an amicus brief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Time for Filing.</cap-smallcap> An amicus curiae must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed. An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the appellant's or petitioner's principal brief is filed. A court may grant leave for later filing, specifying the time within which an opposing party may answer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reply Brief.</cap-smallcap> Except by the court's permission, an amicus curiae may not file a reply brief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Oral Argument.</cap-smallcap> An amicus curiae may participate in oral argument only with the court's permission.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">Only five circuits presently regulate the filing of the brief of an amicus curiae. See D.C. Cir. Rule 18(j); 1st Cir. Rule 23(10); 6th Cir. Rule 17(4); 9th Cir. Rule 18(9); 10th Cir. Rule 20. This rule follows the practice of a majority of circuits in requiring leave of court to file an amicus brief except under the circumstances stated therein. Compare Supreme Court Rule 42.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> The major change in this subpart is that when a brief is filed with the consent of all parties, it is no longer necessary to obtain the parties&rsquo; written consent and to file the consents with the brief. It is sufficient to obtain the parties&rsquo; oral consent and to state in the brief that all parties have consented. It is sometimes difficult to obtain all the written consents by the filing deadline and it is not unusual for counsel to represent that parties have consented; for example, in a motion for extension of time to file a brief it is not unusual for the movant to state that the <!-- PDFPage:49 -->other parties have been consulted and they do not object to the extension. If a party's consent has been misrepresented, the party will be able to take action before the court considers the amicus brief.</p>
<p class="note-body">The District of Columbia is added to the list of entities allowed to file an amicus brief without consent of all parties. The other changes in this material are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> The provision in the former rule, granting permission to conditionally file the brief with the motion, is changed to one requiring that the brief accompany the motion. Sup. Ct. R. 37.4 requires that the proposed brief be presented with the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former rule only required the motion to identify the applicant's interest and to generally state the reasons why an amicus brief is desirable. The amended rule additionally requires that the motion state the relevance of the matters asserted to the disposition of the case. As Sup. Ct. R. 37.1 states:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">An <em>amicus curiae</em> brief which brings relevant matter to the attention of the Court that has not already been brought to its attention by the parties is of considerable help to the Court. An <em>amicus curiae</em> brief which does not serve this purpose simply burdens the staff and facilities of the Court and its filing is not favored.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Because the relevance of the matters asserted by an amicus is ordinarily the most compelling reason for granting leave to file, the Committee believes that it is helpful to explicitly require such a showing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> The provisions in this subdivision are entirely new. Previously there was confusion as to whether an amicus brief must include all of the items listed in Rule 28. Out of caution practitioners in some circuits included all those items. Ordinarily that is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the cover identify the party supported and indicate whether the amicus supports affirmance or reversal is an administrative aid.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (c)(3) requires an amicus to state the source of its authority to file. The amicus simply must identify which of the provisions in Rule 29(a) provides the basis for the amicus to file its brief.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d).</em> This new provision imposes a shorter page limit for an amicus brief than for a party's brief. This is appropriate for two reasons. First, an amicus may omit certain items that must be included in a party's brief. Second, an amicus brief is supplemental. It need not address all issues or all facets of a case. It should treat only matter not adequately addressed by a party.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e).</em> The time limit for filing is changed. An amicus brief must be filed no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed. Occasionally, an amicus supports neither party; in such instances, the amendment provides that the amicus brief must be filed no later than 7 days after the appellant's or petitioner's principal brief is filed. Note that in both instances the 7-day period runs from when a brief is filed. The passive voice&mdash;&ldquo;is filed&rdquo;&mdash;is used deliberately. A party or amicus can send its brief to a court for filing and, under Rule 25, the brief is timely if mailed within the filing period. Although the brief is timely if mailed within the filing period, it is not &ldquo;filed&rdquo; until the court receives it and file stamps it. &ldquo;Filing&rdquo; is done by the court, not by the party. It may be necessary for an amicus to contact the court to ascertain the filing date.</p>
<p class="note-body">The 7-day stagger was adopted because it is long enough to permit an amicus to review the completed brief of the party being supported and avoid repetitious argument. A 7-day period also is short enough that no adjustment need be made in the opposing party's briefing schedule. The opposing party will have sufficient time to review arguments made by the amicus and address them in the party's responsive pleading. The timetable for filing the parties&rsquo; briefs is unaffected by this change.</p>
<p class="note-body">A court may grant permission to file an amicus brief in a context in which the party does not file a &ldquo;principal brief&rdquo;; for example, an amicus may be permitted to file in support of a party's petition for rehearing. In such instances the court will establish the filing time for the amicus.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former rule's statement that a court may, for cause shown, grant leave for later filing is unnecessary. Rule 26(b) grants general authority to enlarge the time prescribed in these rules for good cause shown. This new rule, however, states that when a court grants permission for later filing, the court must specify the period within which an opposing party may answer the arguments of the amicus.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f).</em> This subdivision generally prohibits the filing a a reply brief by an amicus curiae. Sup. Ct. R. 37 and local rules of the D.C., Ninth, and Federal Circuits state that an amicus may not file a reply brief. The role of an amicus should not require the use of a reply brief.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g).</em> The language of this subdivision stating that an amicus will be granted permission to participate in oral argument &ldquo;only for extraordinary reasons&rdquo; has been deleted. The change is made to reflect more accurately the current practice in which it is not unusual for a court to permit an amicus to argue when a party is willing to share its argument time with the amicus. The Committee does not intend, however, to suggest that in other instances an amicus will be permitted to argue absent extraordinary circumstances.</p>
