<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">First Defense</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">The complaint fails to state a claim against defendant upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Second Defense</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">If defendant is indebted to plaintiffs for the goods mentioned in the complaint, he is indebted to them jointly with G. H.&nbsp;&nbsp; G. H. is alive; is a citizen of the State of New York and a resident of this district, is subject to the jurisdiction of this court, as to both service of process and venue; can be made a party without depriving this court of jurisdiction of the present parties, and has not been made a party.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Third Defense</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">Defendant admits the allegation contained in paragraphs 1 and 4 of the complaint; alleges that he is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations contained in paragraph 2 of the complaint; and denies each and every other allegation contained in the complaint.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Fourth Defense</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">The right of action set forth in the complaint did not accrue within six years next before the commencement of this action.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Counterclaim</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(Here set forth any claim as a counterclaim in the manner in which a claim is pleaded in a complaint. No statement of the grounds on which the court's jurisdiction depends need be made unless the counterclaim requires independent grounds of jurisdiction.)</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Cross-Claim Against Defendant M. N.</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(Here set forth the claim constituting a cross-claim against defendant M. N. in the manner in which a claim is pleaded in a complaint. The statement of grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends need not be made unless the cross-claim requires independent grounds of jurisdiction.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The above form contains examples of certain defenses provided for in Rule 12(b). The first defense challenges <!-- PDFPage:278 -->the legal sufficiency of the complaint. It is a substitute for a general demurrer or a motion to dismiss.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second defense embodies the old plea in abatement; the decision thereon, however, may well provide under Rules 19 and 21 for the citing in of the party rather than an abatement of the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third defense is an answer on the merits.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fourth defense is one of the affirmative defenses provided for in Rule 8(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">The answer also includes a counterclaim and a cross-claim.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The explanatory note incorporates revisions made by the Advisory Committee at the same time amendments to certain rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were made. See also rule 12(b), as amended.</p>
