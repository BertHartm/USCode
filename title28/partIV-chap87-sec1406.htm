<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) provides statutory sanction for transfer instead of dismissal, where venue is improperly laid.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is declaratory of existing law. (See <em>Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson</em>, 1924, 44 S.Ct. 391, 264 U.S. 375, 68 L.Ed. 748.) It makes clear the intent of Congress that venue provisions are not jurisdictional but may be waived.</p>
