<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is in accordance with common practice. In most of the states listed in the <em>Note</em> to Rule 26(a), provisions similar to this rule will be found in the statutes which in their respective statutory compilations follow those cited in the <em>Note</em> to Rule 26(a).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Confusion is created by the use of the same terminology to describe both the taking of a deposition upon &ldquo;written interrogatories&rdquo; pursuant to this rule and the serving of &ldquo;written interrogatories&rdquo; upon parties pursuant to Rule 33. The distinction between these two modes of discovery will be more readily and clearly grasped through substitution of the word &ldquo;questions&rdquo; for &ldquo;interrogatories&rdquo; throughout this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. A new paragraph is inserted at the beginning of this subdivision to conform to the rearrangement of provisions in Rules 26(a), 30(a), and 30(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised subdivision permits designation of the deponent by general description or by class or group. This conforms to the practice for depositions on oral examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new procedure provided in Rule 30(b)(6) for taking the deposition of a corporation or other organization through persons designated by the organization is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p class="note-body">The service of all questions, including cross, redirect, and recross, is to be made on all parties. This will inform the parties and enable them to participate fully in the procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">The time allowed for service of cross, redirect, and recross questions has been extended. Experience with the existing time limits shows them to be unrealistically short. No special restriction is placed on the time for serving the notice of taking the deposition and the first set of questions. Since no party is required to serve cross questions less than 30 days after the notice and questions are served, the defendant has sufficient time to obtain counsel. The court may for cause shown enlarge or shorten the time.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Since new Rule 26(c) provides for protective orders with respect to all discovery, and expressly provides that the court may order that one discovery device be used in place of another, subdivision (d) is eliminated as unnecessary.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The first paragraph of subdivision (a) is divided into two subparagraphs, with provisions comparable to those made in the revision of Rule 30. Changes are made in the former third paragraph, numbered in the revision as paragraph (4), to reduce the total time for developing cross-examination, redirect, and recross questions from 50 days to 28 days.</p>
