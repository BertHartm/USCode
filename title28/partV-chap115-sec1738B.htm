<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 103&ndash;383 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) there is a large and growing number of child support cases annually involving disputes between parents who reside in different States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the laws by which the courts of different jurisdictions determine their authority to establish child support orders are not uniform;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) those laws, along with the limits imposed by the Federal system on the authority of each State to take certain actions outside its own boundaries&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) encourage noncustodial parents to relocate outside the States where their children and the custodial parents reside to avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of such States, resulting in an increase in the amount of interstate travel and communication required to establish and collect on child support orders and a burden on custodial parents that is expensive, time consuming, and disruptive of occupations and commercial activity;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:373 --><p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) contribute to the pressing problem of relatively low levels of child support payments in interstate cases and to inequities in child support payments levels that are based solely on the noncustodial parent's choice of residence;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) encourage a disregard of court orders resulting in massive arrearages nationwide;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) allow noncustodial parents to avoid the payment of regularly scheduled child support payments for extensive periods of time, resulting in substantial hardship for the children for whom support is due and for their custodians; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) lead to the excessive relitigation of cases and to the establishment of conflicting orders by the courts of various jurisdictions, resulting in confusion, waste of judicial resources, disrespect for the courts, and a diminution of public confidence in the rule of law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) among the results of the conditions described in this subsection are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the failure of the courts of the States to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the other States;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the deprivation of rights of liberty and property without due process of law;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) burdens on commerce among the States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) harm to the welfare of children and their parents and other custodians.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In view of the findings made in subsection (a), it is necessary to establish national standards under which the courts of the various States shall determine their jurisdiction to issue a child support order and the effect to be given by each State to child support orders issued by the courts of other States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [enacting this section and provisions set out as a note under section 1 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to facilitate the enforcement of child support orders among the States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to discourage continuing interstate controversies over child support in the interest of greater financial stability and secure family relationships for the child; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict among State courts in the establishment of child support orders.&rdquo;</p>
