<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Filing the Notice of Appeal.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4. At the time of filing, the appellant must furnish the clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with Rule 3(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An appellant's failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the court of appeals to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An appeal from a judgment by a magistrate judge in a civil case is taken in the same way as an appeal from any other district court judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) An appeal by permission under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b) or an appeal in a bankruptcy case may be taken only in the manner prescribed by Rules 5 and 6, respectively.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Joint or Consolidated Appeals.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a district-court judgment or order, and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) When the parties have filed separate timely notices of appeal, the appeals may be joined or consolidated by the court of appeals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contents of the Notice of Appeal.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The notice of appeal must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice, but an attorney representing more than one party may describe those parties with such terms as &ldquo;all plaintiffs,&rdquo; &ldquo;the defendants,&rdquo; &ldquo;the plaintiffs A, B, et al.,&rdquo; or &ldquo;all defendants except X&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer's spouse and minor children (if they are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In a class action, whether or not the class has been certified, the notice of appeal is sufficient if it names one person qualified to bring the appeal as representative of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of a notice of appeal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Serving the Notice of Appeal.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The district clerk must serve notice of the filing of a notice of appeal by mailing a copy to each party's counsel of record&mdash;excluding the appellant's&mdash;or, if a party is proceeding pro se, to the party's last known address. When a defendant in a criminal case appeals, the clerk must also serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the defendant, either by personal service or by mail addressed to the defendant. The clerk must promptly send a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries&mdash;and any later docket entries&mdash;to the clerk of the court of appeals named in the notice. The district clerk must note, on each copy, the date when the notice of appeal was filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in the manner provided by Rule 4(c), the district clerk must also note the date when the clerk docketed the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The district clerk's failure to serve notice does not affect the validity of the appeal. The clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties to whom the clerk mails copies, with the date of mailing. Service is sufficient despite the death of a party or the party's counsel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Payment of Fees.</cap-smallcap> Upon filing a notice of appeal, the appellant must pay the district clerk all required fees. The district clerk receives the appellate docket fee on behalf of the court of appeals.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>General Note</em>. Rule 3 and Rule 4 combine to require that a notice of appeal be filed with the clerk of the district court within the time prescribed for taking an appeal. Because the timely filing of a notice of appeal is &ldquo;mandatory and jurisdictional,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Robinson</em>, 361 U.S. 220, 224, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960), compliance with the provisions of those rules is of the utmost importance. But the proposed rules merely restate, in modified form, provisions now found in the civil and criminal rules (FRCP 5(e), 73; FRCrP 37), and decisions under the present rules which dispense with literal compliance in cases in which it cannot fairly be exacted should control interpretation of these rules. Il<!-- PDFPage:6 -->lustrative decisions are: <em>Fallen v. United States</em>, 378 U.S. 139, 84 S.Ct. 1689, 12 L.Ed.2d 760 (1964) (notice of appeal by a prisoner, in the form of a letter delivered, well within the time fixed for appeal, to prison authorities for mailing to the clerk of the district court held timely filed notwithstanding that it was received by the clerk after expiration of the time for appeal; the appellant &ldquo;did all he could&rdquo; to effect timely filing); <em>Richey v. Wilkins</em>, 335 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1964) (notice filed in the court of appeals by a prisoner without assistance of counsel held sufficient); <em>Halfen v. United States</em>, 324 F.2d 52 (10th Cir. 1963) (notice mailed to district judge in time to have been received by him in normal course held sufficient); <em>Riffle v. United States</em>, 299 F.2d 802 (5th Cir. 1962) (letter of prisoner to judge of court of appeals held sufficient). Earlier cases evidencing &ldquo;a liberal view of papers filed by indigent and incarcerated defendants&rdquo; are listed in <em>Coppedge v. United States</em>, 369 U.S. 438, 442, n. 5, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The substance of this subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a) and FRCrP 37(a)(1). The proposed rule follows those rules in requiring nothing other than the filing of a notice of appeal in the district court for the perfection of the appeal. The petition for allowance (except for appeals governed by Rules 5 and 6), citations, assignments of error, summons and severance&mdash;all specifically abolished by earlier modern rules&mdash;are assumed to be sufficiently obsolete as no longer to require pointed abolition.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The first sentence is derived from FRCP 74. The second sentence is added to encourage consolidation of appeals whenever feasible.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This subdivision is identical with corresponding provisions in FRCP 73(b) and FRCrP 37(a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(b) and FRCrP 37(a)(1). The duty of the clerk to forward a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries to the court of appeals in a criminal case extended to habeas corpus and 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 proceedings.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The proposed amendment would add the last sentence. Because of the fact that the timely filing of the notice of appeal has been characterized as jurisdictional (See, e.g., <em>Brainerd v. Beal</em> (C.A. 7th, 1974) 498 F.2d 901, in which the filing of a notice of appeal one day late was fatal), it is important that the right to appeal not be lost by mistakes of mere form. In a number of decided cases it has been held that so long as the function of notice is met by the filing of a paper indicating an intention to appeal, the substance of the rule has been complied with. See, e.g., <em>Cobb v. Lewis</em> (C.A. 5th, 1974) 488 F.2d 41; <em>Holley v. Capps</em> (C.A. 5th, 1972) 468 F.2d 1366. The proposed amendment would give recognition to this practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">When a notice of appeal is filed, the clerk should ascertain whether any judgment designated therein has been entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) of the F.R.C.P. See Note to Rule 4(a)(6), infra.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The proposed amendment would extend to civil cases the present provision applicable to criminal cases, habeas corpus cases, and proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255, requiring the clerk of the district court to transmit to the clerk of the court of appeals a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries, which should include reference to compliance with the requirements for payment of fees. See Note to (e), infra.</p>
<p class="note-body">This requirement is the initial step in proposed changes in the rules to place in the court of appeals an increased practical control over the early steps in the appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Proposed new Rule 3(e) represents the second step in shifting to the court of appeals the control of the early stages of an appeal. See Note to Rule 3(d) above. Under the present rules the payment of the fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 1917 is not covered. Under the statute, however, this fee is paid to the clerk of the district court at the time the notice of appeal is filed. Under present Rule 12, the &ldquo;docket fee&rdquo; fixed by the Judicial Conference of the United States under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1913 must be paid to the clerk of the court of appeals within the time fixed for transmission of the record, &ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the clerk shall thereupon enter the appeal upon the docket.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the proposed new Rule 3(e) both fees would be paid to the clerk of the district court at the time the notice of appeal is filed, the clerk of the district court receiving the docket fee on behalf of the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of the provision in Rule 3(a) that &ldquo;[f]ailure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the court of appeals deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal,&rdquo; the case law indicates that the failure to prepay the statutory filing fee does not constitute a jurisdictional defect. See <em>Parissi v. Telechron</em>, 349 U.S. 46 (1955); <em>Gould v. Members of N. J. Division of Water Policy & Supply</em>, 555 F.2d 340 (3d Cir. 1977). Similarly, under present Rule 12, failure to pay the docket fee within the time prescribed may be excused by the court of appeals. See, e. g., <em>Walker v. Mathews</em>, 546 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1976). Proposed new Rule 3(e) adopts the view of these cases, requiring that both fees be paid at the time the notice of appeal is filed, but subject to the provisions of Rule 26(b) preserving the authority of the court of appeals to permit late payment.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rule 3(d) are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (c). The amendment is intended to reduce the amount of satellite litigation spawned by the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co</em>., 487 U.S. 312 (1988). In <em>Torres</em> the Supreme Court held that the language in Rule 3(c) requiring a notice of appeal to &ldquo;specify the party or parties taking the appeal&rdquo; is a jurisdictional requirement and that naming the first named party and adding &ldquo;et al.,&rdquo; without any further specificity is insufficient to identify the appellants. Since the <em>Torres</em> decision, there has been a great deal of litigation regarding whether a notice of appeal that contains some indication of the appellants&rsquo; identities but does not name the appellants is sufficiently specific.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment states a general rule that specifying the parties should be done by naming them. Naming an appellant in an otherwise timely and proper notice of appeal ensures that the appellant has perfected an appeal. However, in order to prevent the loss of a right to appeal through inadvertent omission of a party's name or continued use of such terms as &ldquo;et al.,&rdquo; which are sufficient in all district court filings after the complaint, the amendment allows an attorney representing more than one party the flexibility to indicate which parties are appealing without naming them individually. The test established by the rule for determining whether such designations are sufficient is whether it is objectively clear that a party intended to appeal. A notice of appeal filed by a party proceeding <em>pro se</em> is filed on behalf of the party signing the notice and the signer's spouse and minor children, if they are parties, unless the notice clearly indicates a contrary intent.</p>
<p class="note-body">In class actions, naming each member of a class as an appellant may be extraordinarily burdensome or even <!-- PDFPage:7 -->impossible. In class actions if class certification has been denied, named plaintiffs may appeal the order denying the class certification on their own behalf and on behalf of putative class members, <em>United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty</em>, 445 U.S. 388 (1980); or if the named plaintiffs choose not to appeal the order denying the class certification, putative class members may appeal, <em>United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald</em>, 432 U.S. 385 (1977). If no class has been certified, naming each of the putative class members as an appellant would often be impossible. Therefore the amendment provides that in class actions, whether or not the class has been certified, it is sufficient for the notice to name one person qualified to bring the appeal as a representative of the class.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the rule makes it clear that dismissal of an appeal should not occur when it is otherwise clear from the notice that the party intended to appeal. If a court determines it is objectively clear that a party intended to appeal, there are neither administrative concerns nor fairness concerns that should prevent the appeal from going forward.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (d). The amendment requires the district court clerk to send to the clerk of the court of appeals a copy of every docket entry in a case after the filing of a notice of appeal. This amendment accompanies the amendment to Rule 4(a)(4), which provides that when one of the posttrial motions enumerated in Rule 4(a)(4) is filed, a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of the motion becomes effective upon disposition of the motion. The court of appeals needs to be advised that the filing of a posttrial motion has suspended a notice of appeal. The court of appeals also needs to know when the district court has ruled on the motion. Sending copies of all docket entries after the filing of a notice of appeal should provide the courts of appeals with the necessary information.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment requires a party filing a notice of appeal to provide the court with sufficient copies of the notice for service on all other parties.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are generally intended to be stylistic only; in this rule, however, substantive changes are made in subdivisions (a), (b), and (d).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> The provision in paragraph (a)(3) is transferred from former Rule 3.1(b). The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104&ndash;317, repealed paragraphs (4) and (5) of 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c). That statutory change made the continued separate existence of Rule 3.1 unnecessary. New paragraph (a)(3) of this rule simply makes it clear that an appeal from a judgment by a magistrate judge is taken in identical fashion to any other appeal from a district-court judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> A joint appeal is authorized only when two or more persons may appeal from a single judgment or order. A joint appeal is treated as a single appeal and the joint appellants file a single brief. Under existing Rule 3(b) parties decide whether to join their appeals. They may do so by filing a joint notice of appeal or by joining their appeals after filing separate notices of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">In consolidated appeals the separate appeals do not merge into one. The parties do not proceed as a single appellant. Under existing Rule 3(b) it is unclear whether appeals may be consolidated without court order if the parties stipulate to consolidation. The language resolves that ambiguity by requiring court action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language also requires court action to join appeals after separate notices of appeal have been filed.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d).</em> Paragraph (d)(2) has been amended to require that when an inmate files a notice of appeal by depositing the notice in the institution's internal mail system, the clerk must note the docketing date&mdash;rather than the receipt date&mdash;on the notice of appeal before serving copies of it. This change conforms to a change in Rule 4(c). Rule 4(c) is amended to provide that when an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil case by depositing the notice in an institution's internal mail system, the time for filing a cross-appeal runs from the date the district court dockets the inmate's notice of appeal. Existing Rule 4(c) says that in such a case the time for filing a cross-appeal runs from the date the district court receives the inmate's notice of appeal. A court may &ldquo;receive&rdquo; a paper when its mail is delivered to it even if the mail is not processed for a day or two, making the date of receipt uncertain. &ldquo;Docketing&rdquo; is an easily identified event. The change is made to eliminate the uncertainty.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104&ndash;317, repealed paragraphs (4) and (5) of 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c). That statutory change means that when parties consent to trial before a magistrate judge, appeal lies directly, and as a matter of right, to the court of appeals under &sect;636(c)(3). The parties may not choose to appeal first to a district judge and thereafter seek discretionary review in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a result of the statutory amendments, subdivision (a) of Rule 3.1 is no longer necessary. Since Rule 3.1 existed primarily because of the provisions in subdivision (a), subdivision (b) has been moved to Rule 3(a)(3) and Rule 3.1 has been abrogated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed before or during the 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that party shows excusable neglect or good cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be ex parte unless the court requires otherwise. If the motion is filed after the expiration of the prescribed time, notice must be given to the other parties in accordance with local rules.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Reopening the Time to File an Appeal.</em> The district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if all the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the court finds that the moving party did not receive notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within 21 days after entry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 14 days after the moving party receives notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is earlier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <em>Entry Defined.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(a):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1) does not require a separate document, when the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1) requires a separate document, when the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a) and when the earlier of these events occurs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">&bull; the judgment or order is set forth on a separate document, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">&bull; 150 days have run from entry of the judgment or order in the civil docket under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A failure to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document when required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1) does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment or order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Appeal in a Criminal Case.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days after the later of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the filing of the government's notice of appeal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) When the government is entitled to appeal, its notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the later of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the entry of the judgment or order being appealed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Filing Before Entry of Judgment.</em> A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order&mdash;but before the entry of the judgment or order&mdash;is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If a defendant timely makes any of the following motions under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the notice of appeal from a judgment of conviction must be filed within 14 days after the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion, or within 14 days after the entry of the judgment of conviction, whichever period ends later. This provision applies to a timely motion:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for a new trial under Rule 33, but if based on newly discovered evidence, only if the motion is made no later than 14 days after the entry of the judgment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for arrest of judgment under Rule 34.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order&mdash;but before it disposes of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A)&mdash;becomes effective upon the later of the following:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:9 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the entry of the judgment of conviction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A valid notice of appeal is effective&mdash;without amendment&mdash;to appeal from an order disposing of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Motion for Extension of Time.</em> Upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may&mdash;before or after the time has expired, with or without motion and notice&mdash;extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Jurisdiction.</em> The filing of a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(b) does not divest a district court of jurisdiction to correct a sentence under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), nor does the filing of a motion under 35(a) affect the validity of a notice of appeal filed before entry of the order disposing of the motion. The filing of a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) does not suspend the time for filing a notice of appeal from a judgment of conviction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Entry Defined.</em> A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appeal by an Inmate Confined in an Institution.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If an inmate files the first notice of appeal in a civil case under this Rule 4(c), the 14-day period provided in Rule 4(a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date when the district court dockets the first notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) When a defendant in a criminal case files a notice of appeal under this Rule 4(c), the 30-day period for the government to file its notice of appeal runs from the entry of the judgment or order appealed from or from the district court's docketing of the defendant's notice of appeal, whichever is later.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Mistaken Filing in the Court of Appeals.</cap-smallcap> If a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case is mistakenly filed in the court of appeals, the clerk of that court must note on the notice the date when it was received and send it to the district clerk.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(a) without any change of substance. The requirement that a request for an extension of time for filing the notice of appeal made after expiration of the time be made by motion and on notice codifies the result reached under the present provisions of FRCP 73(a) and 6(b). <em>North Umberland Mining Co. v. Standard Accident Ins. Co</em>., 193 F.2d 951 (9th Cir., 1952); <em>Cohen v. Plateau Natural Gas Co</em>., 303 F.2d 273 (10th Cir., 1962); <em>Plant Economy, Inc. v. Mirror Insulation Co</em>., 308 F.2d 275 (3d Cir., 1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">Since this subdivision governs appeals in all civil cases, it supersedes the provisions of section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. &sect;48). Except in cases to which the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, the change is a minor one, since a successful litigant in a bankruptcy proceeding may, under section 25, oblige an aggrieved party to appeal within 30 days after entry of judgment&mdash;the time fixed by this subdivision in cases involving private parties only&mdash;by serving him with notice of entry on the day thereof, and by the terms of section 25 an aggrieved party must in any event appeal within 40 days after entry of judgment. No reason appears why the time for appeal in bankruptcy should not be the same as that in civil cases generally. Furthermore, section 25 is a potential trap for the uninitiated. The time for appeal which it provides is not applicable to all appeals which may fairly be termed appeals in bankruptcy. Section 25 governs only those cases referred to in section 24 as &ldquo;proceedings in bankruptcy&rdquo; and &ldquo;controversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy.&rdquo; <em>Lowenstein v. Reikes</em>, 54 F.2d 481 (2d Cir., 1931), <em>cert. den</em>., 285 U.S. 539, 52 S.Ct. 311, 76 L.Ed. 932 (1932). The distinction between such cases and other cases which arise out of bankruptcy is often difficult to determine. See 2 Moore's Collier on Bankruptcy &nbsp;24.12 through &nbsp;24.36 (1962). As a result it is not always clear whether an appeal is governed by section 25 or by FRCP 73(a), which is applicable to such appeals in bankruptcy as are not governed by section 25.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of the unification of the civil and admiralty procedure accomplished by the amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effective July 1, 1966, this subdivision governs appeals in those civil actions which involve admiralty or maritime claims and which prior to that date were known as suits in admiralty.</p>
<p class="note-body">The only other change possibly effected by this subdivision is in the time for appeal from a decision of a district court on a petition for impeachment of an award of a board of arbitration under the Act of May 20, 1926, c. 347, &sect;9 (44 Stat. 585), 45 U.S.C. &sect;159. The act provides that a notice of appeal from such a decision shall be filed within 10 days of the decision. This singular provision was apparently repealed by the enactment in 1948 of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2107, which fixed 30 days from the date of entry of judgment as the time for appeal in all actions of a civil nature except actions in admiralty or bankruptcy matters or those in which the United States is a party. But it was not expressly repealed, and its status is in doubt. See 7 Moore's Federal Practice &nbsp;73.09[2] (1966). The doubt should be resolved, and no reason appears why appeals in such cases should not be taken within the time provided for civil cases generally.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b). </em>This subdivision is derived from FRCrP 37(a)(2) without change of substance.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)</em>. The words &ldquo;(including a civil action which involves an admiralty or maritime claim and a proceeding in bankruptcy or a controversy arising therein),&rdquo; which appear in the present rule are struck <!-- PDFPage:10 -->out as unnecessary and perhaps misleading in suggesting that there may be other categories that are not either civil or criminal within the meaning of Rule 4(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrases &ldquo;within 30 days of such entry&rdquo; and &ldquo;within 60 days of such entry&rdquo; have been changed to read &ldquo;after&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or.&rdquo; The change is for clarity only, since the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; in the present rule appears to be used to mean &ldquo;after.&rdquo; Since the proposed amended rule deals directly with the premature filing of a notice of appeal, it was thought useful to emphasize the fact that except as provided, the period during which a notice of appeal may be filed is the 30 days, or 60 days as the case may be, following the entry of the judgment or order appealed from. See Notes to Rule 4(a)(2) and (4), below.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2)</em>. The proposed amendment to Rule 4(a)(2) would extend to civil cases the provisions of Rule 4(b), dealing with criminal cases, designed to avoid the loss of the right to appeal by filing the notice of appeal prematurely. Despite the absence of such a provision in Rule 4(a) the courts of appeals quite generally have held premature appeals effective. See, e. g., <em>Matter of Grand Jury Empanelled Jan. 21, 1975</em>, 541 F.2d 373 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Hodge v. Hodge</em>, 507 F.2d 87 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Song Jook Suh v. Rosenberg</em>, 437 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Ruby v. Secretary of the Navy</em>, 365 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1966); <em>Firchau v. Diamond Nat'l Corp</em>., 345 F.2d 469 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amended rule would recognize this practice but make an exception in cases in which a post trial motion has destroyed the finality of the judgment. See Note to Rule 4(a)(4) below.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4)</em>. The proposed amendment would make it clear that after the filing of the specified post trial motions, a notice of appeal should await disposition of the motion. Since the proposed amendments to Rules 3, 10, and 12 contemplate that immediately upon the filing of the notice of appeal the fees will be paid and the case docketed in the court of appeals, and the steps toward its disposition set in motion, it would be undesirable to proceed with the appeal while the district court has before it a motion the granting of which would vacate or alter the judgment appealed from. See, e. g., <em>Kieth v. Newcourt</em>, 530 F.2d 826 (8th Cir. 1976). Under the present rule, since docketing may not take place until the record is transmitted, premature filing is much less likely to involve waste effort. See, e. g., <em>Stokes v. Peyton's Inc</em>., 508 F.2d 1287 (5th Cir. 1975). Further, since a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a post trial motion, even if it were treated as valid for purposes of jurisdiction, would not embrace objections to the denial of the motion, it is obviously preferable to postpone the notice of appeal until after the motion is disposed of.</p>
<p class="note-body">The present rule, since it provides for the &ldquo;termination&rdquo; of the &ldquo;running&rdquo; of the appeal time, is ambiguous in its application to a notice of appeal filed prior to a post trial motion filed within the 10 day limit. The amendment would make it clear that in such circumstances the appellant should not proceed with the appeal during pendency of the motion but should file a new notice of appeal after the motion is disposed of.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)</em>. Under the present rule it is provided that upon a showing of excusable neglect the district court at any time may extend the time for the filing of a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by the rule, but that if the application is made after the original time has run, the order may be made only on motion with such notice as the court deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">A literal reading of this provision would require that the extension be ordered and the notice of appeal filed within the 30 day period, but despite the surface clarity of the rule, it has produced considerable confusion. See the discussion by Judge Friendly in <em>In re Orbitek</em>, 520 F.2d 358 (2d Cir. 1975). The proposed amendment would make it clear that a motion to extend the time must be filed no later than 30 days after the expiration of the original appeal time, and that if the motion is timely filed the district court may act upon the motion at a later date, and may extend the time not in excess of 10 days measured from the date on which the order granting the motion is entered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the present rule there is a possible implication that prior to the time the initial appeal time has run, the district court may extend the time on the basis of an informal application. The amendment would require that the application must be made by motion, though the motion may be made ex parte. After the expiration of the initial time a motion for the extension of the time must be made in compliance with the F.R.C.P. and local rules of the district court. See Note to proposed amended Rule 1, supra. And see Rules 6(d), 7(b) of the F.R.C.P.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amended rule expands to some extent the standard for the grant of an extension of time. The present rule requires a &ldquo;showing of excusable neglect.&rdquo; While this was an appropriate standard in cases in which the motion is made after the time for filing the notice of appeal has run, and remains so, it has never fit exactly the situation in which the appellant seeks an extension before the expiration of the initial time. In such a case &ldquo;good cause,&rdquo; which is the standard that is applied in the granting of other extensions of time under Rule 26(b) seems to be more appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6)</em>. The proposed amendment would call attention to the requirement of Rule 58 of the F.R.C.P. that the judgment constitute a separate document. See <em>United States v. Indrelunas</em>, 411 U.S. 216 (1973). When a notice of appeal is filed, the clerk should ascertain whether any judgment designated therein has been entered in compliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) and if not, so advise all parties and the district judge. While the requirement of Rule 48 is not jurisdictional (see <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis</em>, 431 U.S. 928 (1977)), compliance is important since the time for the filing of a notice of appeal by other parties is measured by the time at which the judgment is properly entered.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides a limited opportunity for relief in circumstances where the notice of entry of a judgment or order, required to be mailed by the clerk of the district court pursuant to Rule 77(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is either not received by a party or is received so late as to impair the opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal. The amendment adds a new subdivision (6) allowing a district court to reopen for a brief period the time for appeal upon a finding that notice of entry of a judgment or order was not received from the clerk or a party within 21 days of its entry and that no party would be prejudiced. By &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; the Committee means some adverse consequence other than the cost of having to oppose the appeal and encounter the risk of reversal, consequences that are present in every appeal. Prejudice might arise, for example, if the appellee had taken some action in reliance on the expiration of the normal time period for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reopening may be ordered only upon a motion filed within 180 days of the entry of a judgment or order or within 7 days of receipt of notice of such entry, whichever is earlier. This provision establishes an outer time limit of 180 days for a party who fails to receive timely notice of entry of a judgment to seek additional time to appeal and enables any winning party to shorten the 180-day period by sending (and establishing proof of receipt of) its own notice of entry of a judgment, as authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 77(d). Winning parties are encouraged to send their own notice in order to lessen the chance that a judge will accept a claim of non-receipt in the face of evidence that notices were sent by both the clerk and the winning party. Receipt of a winning party's notice will shorten only the time for reopening the time for appeal under this subdivision, leaving the normal time periods for appeal unaffected.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the motion is granted, the district court may reopen the time for filing a notice of appeal only for a pe<!-- PDFPage:11 -->riod of 14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(1). The amendment is intended to alert readers to the fact that paragraph (a)(4) extends the time for filing an appeal when certain posttrial motions are filed. The Committee hopes that awareness of the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) will prevent the filing of a notice of appeal when a posttrial tolling motion is pending.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(2). The amendment treats a notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision or order, but before its formal entry, as if the notice had been filed after entry. The amendment deletes the language that made paragraph (a)(2) inapplicable to a notice of appeal filed after announcement of the disposition of a posttrial motion enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) but before the entry of the order, <em>see Acosta v. Louisiana Dep't of Health & Human Resources</em>, 478 U.S. 251 (1986) (per curiam); <em>Alerte v. McGinnis</em>, 898 F.2d 69 (7th Cir. 1990). Because the amendment of paragraph (a)(4) recognizes all notices of appeal filed after announcement or entry of judgment&mdash;even those that are filed while the posttrial motions enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) are pending&mdash;the amendment of this paragraph is consistent with the amendment of paragraph (a)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(3). The amendment is technical in nature; no substantive change is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to Paragraph (a)(4). The 1979 amendment of this paragraph created a trap for an unsuspecting litigant who files a notice of appeal before a posttrial motion, or while a posttrial motion is pending. The 1979 amendment requires a party to file a new notice of appeal after the motion's disposition. Unless a new notice is filed, the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co</em>., 459 U.S. 56 (1982). Many litigants, especially pro se litigants, fail to file the second notice of appeal, and several courts have expressed dissatisfaction with the rule. <em>See, e.g., Averhart v. Arrendondo</em>, 773 F.2d 919 (7th Cir. 1985); <em>Harcon Barge Co. v. D & G Boat Rentals, Inc</em>., 746 F.2d 278 (5th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied</em>, 479 U.S. 930 (1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a specified posttrial motion will become effective upon disposition of the motion. A notice filed before the filing of one of the specified motions or after the filing of a motion but before disposition of the motion is, in effect, suspended until the motion is disposed of, whereupon, the previously filed notice effectively places jurisdiction in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because a notice of appeal will ripen into an effective appeal upon disposition of a posttrial motion, in some instances there will be an appeal from a judgment that has been altered substantially because the motion was granted in whole or in part. Many such appeals will be dismissed for want of prosecution when the appellant fails to meet the briefing schedule. But, the appellee may also move to strike the appeal. When responding to such a motion, the appellant would have an opportunity to state that, even though some relief sought in a posttrial motion was granted, the appellant still plans to pursue the appeal. Because the appellant's response would provide the appellee with sufficient notice of the appellant's intentions, the Committee does not believe that an additional notice of appeal is needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a posttrial tolling motion is sufficient to bring the underlying case, as well as any orders specified in the original notice, to the court of appeals. If the judgment is altered upon disposition of a posttrial motion, however, and if a party wishes to appeal from the disposition of the motion, the party must amend the notice to so indicate. When a party files an amended notice, no additional fees are required because the notice is an amendment of the original and not a new notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (a)(4) is also amended to include, among motions that extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, a Rule 60 motion that is served within 10 days after entry of judgment. This eliminates the difficulty of determining whether a posttrial motion made within 10 days after entry of a judgment is a Rule 59(e) motion, which tolls the time for filing an appeal, or a Rule 60 motion, which historically has not tolled the time. The amendment comports with the practice in several circuits of treating all motions to alter or amend judgments that are made within 10 days after entry of judgment as Rule 59(e) motions for purposes of Rule 4(a)(4). <em>See, e.g., Finch v. City of Vernon</em>, 845 F.2d 256 (11th Cir. 1988); <em>Rados v. Celotex Corp</em>., 809 F.2d 170 (2d Cir. 1986); <em>Skagerberg v. Oklahoma</em>, 797 F.2d 881 (10th Cir. 1986). To conform to a recent Supreme Court decision, however&mdash;<em>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Co</em>., 486 U.S. 196 (1988)&mdash;the amendment excludes motions for attorney's fees from the class of motions that extend the filing time unless a district court, acting under Rule 58, enters an order extending the time for appeal. This amendment is to be read in conjunction with the amendment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (b). The amendment grammatically restructures the portion of this subdivision that lists the types of motions that toll the time for filing an appeal. This restructuring is intended to make the rule easier to read. No substantive change is intended other than to add a motion for judgment of acquittal under Criminal Rule 29 to the list of tolling motions. Such a motion is the equivalent of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which tolls the running of time for an appeal in a civil case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment also eliminates an ambiguity from the third sentence of this subdivision. Prior to this amendment, the third sentence provided that if one of the specified motions was filed, the time for filing an appeal would run from the entry of an order denying the motion. That sentence, like the parallel provision in Rule 4(a)(4), was intended to toll the running of time for appeal if one of the posttrial motions is timely filed. In a criminal case, however, the time for filing the motions runs not from entry of judgment (as it does in civil cases), but from the verdict or finding of guilt. Thus, in a criminal case, a posttrial motion may be disposed of more than 10 days before sentence is imposed, i.e. before the entry of judgment. <em>United States v. Hashagen</em>, 816 F.2d 899, 902 n.5 (3d Cir. 1987). To make it clear that a notice of appeal need not be filed before entry of judgment, the amendment states that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order disposing of the motion, or within 10 days after the entry of judgment, whichever is later. The amendment also changes the language in the third sentence providing that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order <em>denying</em> the motion; the amendment says instead that an appeal may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order <em>disposing of the last such motion outstanding</em>. (Emphasis added) The change recognizes that there may be multiple posttrial motions filed and that, although one or more motions may be granted in whole or in part, a defendant may still wish to pursue an appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also states that a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of any of the posttrial tolling motions becomes effective upon disposition of the motions. In most circuits this language simply restates the current practice. <em>See United States v. Cortes</em>, 895 F.2d 1245 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 495 U.S. 939 (1990). Two circuits, however, have questioned that practice in light of the language of the rule, <em>see United States v. Gargano</em>, 826 F.2d 610 (7th Cir. 1987), and <em>United States v. Jones</em>, 669 F.2d 559 (8th Cir. 1982), and the Committee wishes to clarify the rule. The amendment is consistent with the proposed amendment of Rule 4(a)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is further amended in light of new Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c), which authorizes a sentencing court to correct any arithmetical, technical, or other clear errors in sentencing within 7 days after imposing <!-- PDFPage:12 -->the sentence. The Committee believes that a sentencing court should be able to act under Criminal Rule 35(c) even if a notice of appeal has already been filed; and that a notice of appeal should not be affected by the filing of a Rule 35(c) motion or by correction of a sentence under Rule 35(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (c). In <em>Houston v. Lack</em>, 487 U.S. 266 (1988), the Supreme Court held that a <em>pro se</em> prisoner's notice of appeal is &ldquo;filed&rdquo; at the moment of delivery to prison authorities for forwarding to the district court. The amendment reflects that decision. The language of the amendment is similar to that in Supreme Court Rule 29.2.</p>
<p class="note-body">Permitting an inmate to file a notice of appeal by depositing it in an institutional mail system requires adjustment of the rules governing the filing of cross-appeals. In a civil case, the time for filing a cross-appeal ordinarily runs from the date when the first notice of appeal is filed. If an inmate's notice of appeal is filed by depositing it in an institution's mail system, it is possible that the notice of appeal will not arrive in the district court until several days after the &ldquo;filing&rdquo; date and perhaps even after the time for filing a cross-appeal has expired. To avoid that problem, subdivision (c) provides that in a civil case when an institutionalized person files a notice of appeal by depositing it in the institution's mail system, the time for filing a cross-appeal runs from the district court's receipt of the notice. The amendment makes a parallel change regarding the time for the government to appeal in a criminal case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 52, and 59 were previously inconsistent with respect to whether certain postjudgment motions had to be filed or merely served no later than 10 days after entry of judgment. As a consequence Rule 4(a)(4) spoke of making or serving such motions rather than filing them. Civil Rules 50, 52, and 59, are being revised to require filing before the end of the 10-day period. As a consequence, this rule is being amended to provide that &ldquo;filing&rdquo; must occur within the 10 day period in order to affect the finality of the judgment and extend the period for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Civil Rules require the filing of postjudgment motions &ldquo;no later than 10 days after entry of judgment&rdquo;&mdash;rather than &ldquo;within&rdquo; 10 days&mdash;to include postjudgment motions that are filed before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. This rule is amended, therefore, to use the same terminology.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is further amended to clarify the fact that a party who wants to obtain review of an alteration or amendment of a judgment must file a notice of appeal or amend a previously filed notice to indicate intent to appeal from the altered judgment.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; in this rule, however, substantive changes are made in paragraphs (a)(6) and (b)(4), and in subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a), paragraph (1).</em> Although the Advisory Committee does not intend to make any substantive changes in this paragraph, cross-references to Rules 4(a)(1)(B) and 4(c) have been added to subparagraph (a)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a), paragraph (4).</em> Item (vi) in subparagraph (A) of Rule 4(a)(4) provides that filing a motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 will extend the time for filing a notice of appeal if the Rule 60 motion is filed no later than 10 days after judgment is entered. Again, the Advisory Committee does not intend to make any substantive change in this paragraph. But because Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and Fed. R. App. P. 26(a) have different methods for computing time, one might be uncertain whether the 10-day period referred to in Rule 4(a)(4) is computed using Civil Rule 6(a) or Appellate Rule 26(a). Because the Rule 60 motion is filed in the district court, and because Fed. R. App. P. 1(a)(2) says that when the appellate rules provide for filing a motion in the district court, &ldquo;the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court,&rdquo; the rule provides that the 10-day period is computed using Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a), paragraph (6).</em> Paragraph (6) permits a district court to reopen the time for appeal if a party has not received notice of the entry of judgment and no party would be prejudiced by the reopening. Before reopening the time for appeal, the existing rule requires the district court to find that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of judgment and did not receive it &ldquo;from the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry.&rdquo; The Advisory Committee makes a substantive change. The finding must be that the movant did not receive notice &ldquo;from the district court or any party within 21 days after entry.&rdquo; This change broadens the type of notice that can preclude reopening the time for appeal. The existing rule provides that only notice from a party or from the clerk bars reopening. The new language precludes reopening if the movant has received notice from &ldquo;the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> Two substantive changes are made in what will be paragraph (b)(4). The current rule permits an extension of time to file a notice of appeal if there is a &ldquo;showing of excusable neglect.&rdquo; First, the rule is amended to permit a court to extend the time for &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; as well as for excusable neglect. Rule 4(a) permits extensions for both reasons in civil cases and the Advisory Committee believes that &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; should be sufficient in criminal cases as well. The amendment does not limit extensions for good cause to instances in which the motion for extension of time is filed before the original time has expired. The rule gives the district court discretion to grant extensions for good cause whenever the court believes it appropriate to do so provided that the extended period does not exceed 30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by Rule 4(b). Second, paragraph (b)(4) is amended to require only a &ldquo;finding&rdquo; of excusable neglect or good cause and not a &ldquo;showing&rdquo; of them. Because the rule authorizes the court to provide an extension without a motion, a &ldquo;showing&rdquo; is obviously not required; a &ldquo;finding&rdquo; is sufficient.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> Substantive amendments are made in this subdivision. The current rule provides that if an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal by depositing it in the institution's internal mail system, the notice is timely filed if deposited on or before the last day for filing. Some institutions have special internal mail systems for handling legal mail; such systems often record the date of deposit of mail by an inmate, the date of delivery of mail to an inmate, etc. The Advisory Committee amends the rule to require an inmate to use the system designed for legal mail, if there is one, in order to receive the benefit of this subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">When an inmate uses the filing method authorized by subdivision (c), the current rule provides that the time for other parties to appeal begins to run from the date the district court &ldquo;receives&rdquo; the inmate's notice of appeal. The rule is amended so that the time for other parties begins to run when the district court &ldquo;dockets&rdquo; the inmate's appeal. A court may &ldquo;receive&rdquo; a paper when its mail is delivered to it even if the mail is not processed for a day or two, making the date of receipt uncertain. &ldquo;Docketing&rdquo; is an easily identified event. The change eliminates uncertainty. Paragraph (c)(3) is further amended to make it clear that the time for the government to file its appeal runs from the later of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from or the district court's docketing of a defendant's notice filed under this paragraph (c).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)(C).</em> The federal courts of appeals have reached conflicting conclusions about whether an <!-- PDFPage:13 -->appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> is governed by the time limitations of Rule 4(a) (which apply in civil cases) or by the time limitations of Rule 4(b) (which apply in criminal cases). <em>Compare United States v. Craig</em>, 907 F.2d 653, 655&ndash;57, <em>amended</em> 919 F.2d 57 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Cooper</em>, 876 F.2d 1192, 1193&ndash;94 (5th Cir. 1989); and <em>United States v. Keogh</em>, 391 F.2d 138, 140 (2d Cir. 1968) (applying the time limitations of Rule 4(a)); <em>with Yasui v. United States</em>, 772 F.2d 1496, 1498&ndash;99 (9th Cir. 1985); and <em>United States v. Mills</em>, 430 F.2d 526, 527&ndash;28 (8th Cir. 1970) (applying the time limitations of Rule 4(b)). A new part (C) has been added to Rule 4(a)(1) to resolve this conflict by providing that the time limitations of Rule 4(a) will apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsequent to the enactment of Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255, the Supreme Court has recognized the continued availability of a writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> in at least one narrow circumstance. In 1954, the Court permitted a litigant who had been convicted of a crime, served his full sentence, and been released from prison, but who was continuing to suffer a legal disability on account of the conviction, to seek a writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> to set aside the conviction. <em>United States v. Morgan</em>, 346 U.S. 502 (1954). As the Court recognized, in the <em>Morgan</em> situation an application for a writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> &ldquo;is of the same general character as [a motion] under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255.&rdquo; <em>Id</em>. at 506 n.4. Thus, it seems appropriate that the time limitations of Rule 4(a), which apply when a district court grants or denies relief under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255, should also apply when a district court grants or denies a writ of error <em>coram nobis</em>. In addition, the strong public interest in the speedy resolution of criminal appeals that is reflected in the shortened deadlines of Rule 4(b) is not present in the <em>Morgan</em> situation, as the party seeking the writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> has already served his or her full sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notwithstanding <em>Morgan</em>, it is not clear whether the Supreme Court continues to believe that the writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> is available in federal court. In civil cases, the writ has been expressly abolished by Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). In criminal cases, the Supreme Court has recently stated that it has become &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;difficult to conceive of a situation&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; in which the writ &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;would be necessary or appropriate.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>Carlisle v. United States</em>, 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 331 U.S. 469, 475 n.4 (1947)). The amendment to Rule 4(a)(1) is not intended to express any view on this issue; rather, it is merely meant to specify time limitations for appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(a)(1)(C) applies only to motions that are in substance, and not merely in form, applications for writs of error <em>coram nobis</em>. Litigants may bring and label as applications for a writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> what are in reality motions for a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 or motions for correction or reduction of a sentence under Fed. R. Crim. P. 35. In such cases, the time limitations of Rule 4(b), and not those of Rule 4(a), should be enforced.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi).</em> Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) has been amended to remove a parenthetical that directed that the 10-day deadline be &ldquo;computed using Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a).&rdquo; That parenthetical has become superfluous because Rule 26(a)(2) has been amended to require that all deadlines under 11 days be calculated as they are under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)(A)(ii).</em> Rule 4(a)(5)(A) permits the district court to extend the time to file a notice of appeal if two conditions are met. First, the party seeking the extension must file its motion no later than 30 days after the expiration of the time originally prescribed by Rule 4(a). Second, the party seeking the extension must show either excusable neglect or good cause. The text of Rule 4(a)(5)(A) does not distinguish between motions filed prior to the expiration of the original deadline and those filed after the expiration of the original deadline. Regardless of whether the motion is filed before or during the 30 days after the original deadline expires, the district court may grant an extension if a party shows either excusable neglect or good cause.</p>
<p class="note-body">Despite the text of Rule 4(a)(5)(A), most of the courts of appeals have held that the good cause standard applies only to motions brought prior to the expiration of the original deadline and that the excusable neglect standard applies only to motions brought during the 30 days following the expiration of the original deadline. <em>See Pontarelli v. Stone</em>, 930 F.2d 104, 109&ndash;10 (1st Cir. 1991) (collecting cases from the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits). These courts have relied heavily upon the Advisory Committee Note to the 1979 amendment to Rule 4(a)(5). But the Advisory Committee Note refers to a draft of the 1979 amendment that was ultimately rejected. The rejected draft directed that the good cause standard apply only to motions filed prior to the expiration of the original deadline. Rule 4(a)(5), as actually amended, did not. <em>See</em> 16A <cap-smallcap>Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure</cap-smallcap> &sect;3950.3, at 148&ndash;49 (2d ed. 1996).</p>
<p class="note-body">The failure of the courts of appeals to apply Rule 4(a)(5)(A) as written has also created tension between that rule and Rule 4(b)(4). As amended in 1998, Rule 4(b)(4) permits the district court to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal in a <em>criminal</em> case for an additional 30 days upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause. Both Rule 4(b)(4) and the Advisory Committee Note to the 1998 amendment make it clear that an extension can be granted for either excusable neglect or good cause, regardless of whether a motion for an extension is filed before or during the 30 days following the expiration of the original deadline.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(a)(5)(A)(ii) has been amended to correct this misunderstanding and to bring the rule in harmony in this respect with Rule 4(b)(4). A motion for an extension filed prior to the expiration of the original deadline may be granted if the movant shows either excusable neglect or good cause. Likewise, a motion for an extension filed during the 30 days following the expiration of the original deadline may be granted if the movant shows either excusable neglect or good cause.</p>
<p class="note-body">The good cause and excusable neglect standards have &ldquo;different domains.&rdquo; <em>Lorenzen v. Employees Retirement Plan</em>, 896 F.2d 228, 232 (7th Cir. 1990). They are not interchangeable, and one is not inclusive of the other. The excusable neglect standard applies in situations in which there is fault; in such situations, the need for an extension is usually occasioned by something within the control of the movant. The good cause standard applies in situations in which there is no fault&mdash;excusable or otherwise. In such situations, the need for an extension is usually occasioned by something that is not within the control of the movant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Thus, the good cause standard can apply to motions brought during the 30 days following the expiration of the original deadline. If, for example, the Postal Service fails to deliver a notice of appeal, a movant might have good cause to seek a post-expiration extension. It may be unfair to make such a movant prove that its &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; was excusable, given that the movant may not have been neglectful at all. Similarly, the excusable neglect standard can apply to motions brought prior to the expiration of the original deadline. For example, a movant may bring a pre-expiration motion for an extension of time when an error committed by the movant makes it unlikely that the movant will be able to meet the original deadline.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment. The stylistic changes to the Committee Note suggested by Judge Newman were adopted. In addition, two paragraphs were added at the end of the Committee Note to clarify the difference between the good cause and excusable neglect standards.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(7).</em> Several circuit splits have arisen out of uncertainties about how Rule 4(a)(7)'s definition <!-- PDFPage:14 -->of when a judgment or order is &ldquo;entered&rdquo; interacts with the requirement in Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 that, to be &ldquo;effective,&rdquo; a judgment must be set forth on a separate document. Rule 4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 have been amended to resolve those splits.</p>
<p class="note-body"> 1. The first circuit split addressed by the amendments to Rule 4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 concerns the extent to which orders that dispose of post-judgment motions must be set forth on separate documents. Under Rule 4(a)(4)(A), the filing of certain post-judgment motions tolls the time to appeal the underlying judgment until the &ldquo;entry&rdquo; of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion. Courts have disagreed about whether such an order must be set forth on a separate document before it is treated as &ldquo;entered.&rdquo; This disagreement reflects a broader dispute among courts about whether Rule 4(a)(7) independently imposes a separate document requirement (a requirement that is distinct from the separate document requirement that is imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (&ldquo;FRCP&rdquo;)) or whether Rule 4(a)(7) instead incorporates the separate document requirement as it exists in the FRCP. Further complicating the matter, courts in the former &ldquo;camp&rdquo; disagree among themselves about the scope of the separate document requirement that they interpret Rule 4(a)(7) as imposing, and courts in the latter &ldquo;camp&rdquo; disagree among themselves about the scope of the separate document requirement imposed by the FRCP.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(a)(7) has been amended to make clear that it simply incorporates the separate document requirement as it exists in Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. If Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 does not require that a judgment or order be set forth on a separate document, then neither does Rule 4(a)(7); the judgment or order will be deemed entered for purposes of Rule 4(a) when it is entered in the civil docket. If Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 requires that a judgment or order be set forth on a separate document, then so does Rule 4(a)(7); the judgment or order will not be deemed entered for purposes of Rule 4(a) until it is so set forth and entered in the civil docket (with one important exception, described below).</p>
<p class="note-body">In conjunction with the amendment to Rule 4(a)(7), Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 has been amended to provide that orders disposing of the post-judgment motions listed in new Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1) (which post-judgment motions include, but are not limited to, the post-judgment motions that can toll the time to appeal under Rule 4(a)(4)(A)) do not have to be set forth on separate documents. <em>See</em> Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1). Thus, such orders are entered for purposes of Rule 4(a) when they are entered in the civil docket pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). <em>See</em> Rule 4(a)(7)(A)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"> 2. The second circuit split addressed by the amendments to Rule 4(a)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 concerns the following question: When a judgment or order is required to be set forth on a separate document under Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 but is not, does the time to appeal the judgment or order&mdash;or the time to bring post-judgment motions, such as a motion for a new trial under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59&mdash;ever begin to run? According to every circuit except the First Circuit, the answer is &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The First Circuit alone holds that parties will be deemed to have waived their right to have a judgment or order entered on a separate document three months after the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket. <em>See Fiore v. Washington County Community Mental Health Ctr.</em>, 960 F.2d 229, 236 (1st Cir. 1992) (en banc). Other circuits have rejected this cap as contrary to the relevant rules. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Haynes</em>, 158 F.3d 1327, 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1998); <em>Hammack v. Baroid Corp.</em>, 142 F.3d 266, 269&ndash;70 (5th Cir. 1998); <em>Rubin v. Schottenstein, Zox & Dunn</em>, 110 F.3d 1247, 1253 n.4 (6th Cir. 1997), <em>vacated on other grounds</em>, 143 F.3d 263 (6th Cir. 1998) (en banc). However, no court has questioned the wisdom of imposing such a cap as a matter of policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both Rule 4(a)(7)(A) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 have been amended to impose such a cap. Under the amendments, a judgment or order is generally treated as entered when it is entered in the civil docket pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). There is one exception: When Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1) requires the judgment or order to be set forth on a separate document, that judgment or order is not treated as entered until it is set forth on a separate document (in addition to being entered in the civil docket) or until the expiration of 150 days after its entry in the civil docket, whichever occurs first. This cap will ensure that parties will not be given forever to appeal (or to bring a post-judgment motion) when a court fails to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"> 3. The third circuit split&mdash;this split addressed only by the amendment to Rule 4(a)(7)&mdash;concerns whether the appellant may waive the separate document requirement over the objection of the appellee. In <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis</em>, 435 U.S. 381, 387 (1978) (per curiam), the Supreme Court held that the &ldquo;parties to an appeal may waive the separate-judgment requirement of Rule 58.&rdquo; Specifically, the Supreme Court held that when a district court enters an order and &ldquo;clearly evidence[s] its intent that the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. represent[s] the final decision in the case,&rdquo; the order is a &ldquo;final decision&rdquo; for purposes of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1291, even if the order has not been set forth on a separate document for purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. <em>Id</em>. Thus, the parties can choose to appeal without waiting for the order to be set forth on a separate document.</p>
<p class="note-body">Courts have disagreed about whether the consent of all parties is necessary to waive the separate document requirement. Some circuits permit appellees to object to attempted <em>Mallis</em> waivers and to force appellants to return to the trial court, request that judgment be set forth on a separate document, and appeal a second time. <em>See, e.g., Selletti v. Carey</em>, 173 F.3d 104, 109&ndash;10 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>Williams v. Borg</em>, 139 F.3d 737, 739&ndash;40 (9th Cir. 1998); <em>Silver Star Enters., Inc. v. M/V Saramacca</em>, 19 F.3d 1008, 1013 (5th Cir. 1994). Other courts disagree and permit <em>Mallis</em> waivers even if the appellee objects. <em>See, e.g., Haynes</em>, 158 F.3d at 1331; <em>Miller v. Artistic Cleaners</em>, 153 F.3d 781, 783&ndash;84 (7th Cir. 1998); <em>Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co.</em>, 37 F.3d 996, 1006 n.8 (3d Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 4(a)(7)(B) is intended both to codify the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Mallis</em> and to make clear that the decision whether to waive the requirement that the judgment or order be set forth on a separate document is the appellant's alone. It is, after all, the appellant who needs a clear signal as to when the time to file a notice of appeal has begun to run. If the appellant chooses to bring an appeal without waiting for the judgment or order to be set forth on a separate document, then there is no reason why the appellee should be able to object. All that would result from honoring the appellee's objection would be delay.</p>
<p class="note-body"> 4. The final circuit split addressed by the amendment to Rule 4(a)(7) concerns the question whether an appellant who chooses to waive the separate document requirement must appeal within 30 days (60 days if the government is a party) from the entry in the civil docket of the judgment or order that should have been set forth on a separate document but was not. In <em>Townsend v. Lucas</em>, 745 F.2d 933 (5th Cir. 1984), the district court dismissed a 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254 action on May 6, 1983, but failed to set forth the judgment on a separate document. The plaintiff appealed on January 10, 1984. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal, reasoning that, if the plaintiff waived the separate document requirement, then his appeal would be from the May 6 order, and if his appeal was from the May 6 order, then it was untimely under Rule 4(a)(1). The Fifth Circuit stressed that the plaintiff could return to the district court, move that the judgment be set forth on a separate document, and appeal from that judgment within 30 days. <em>Id</em>. at 934. Several other cases have embraced the <em>Townsend</em> approach. <em>See, e.g., Armstrong v. Ahitow</em>, 36 F.3d 574, 575 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam); <em>Hughes v. Halifax County Sch. Bd.</em>, 823 F.2d 832, 835&ndash;36 (4th Cir. 1987); <em>Harris v. McCarthy</em>, 790 F.2d 753, 756 n.1 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">Those cases are in the distinct minority. There are numerous cases in which courts have heard appeals that were not filed within 30 days (60 days if the gov<!-- PDFPage:15 -->ernment was a party) from the judgment or order that should have been set forth on a separate document but was not. <em>See, e.g., Haynes</em>, 158 F.3d at 1330&ndash;31; <em>Clough v. Rush</em>, 959 F.2d 182, 186 (10th Cir. 1992); <em>McCalden v. California Library Ass'n</em>, 955 F.2d 1214, 1218&ndash;19 (9th Cir. 1990). In the view of these courts, the remand in <em>Townsend</em> was &ldquo;precisely the purposeless spinning of wheels abjured by the Court in the [<em>Mallis</em>] case.&rdquo; 15B <cap-smallcap>Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure</cap-smallcap> &sect;3915, at 259 n.8 (3d ed. 1992).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee agrees with the majority of courts that have rejected the <em>Townsend</em> approach. In drafting new Rule 4(a)(7)(B), the Committee has been careful to avoid phrases such as &ldquo;otherwise timely appeal&rdquo; that might imply an endorsement of <em>Townsend</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(B) or to the third or fourth numbered sections of the Committee Note, except that, in several places, references to a judgment being &ldquo;entered&rdquo; on a separate document were changed to references to a judgment being &ldquo;set forth&rdquo; on a separate document. This was to maintain stylistic consistency. The appellate rules and the civil rules consistently refer to &ldquo;entering&rdquo; judgments on the civil docket and to &ldquo;setting forth&rdquo; judgments on separate documents.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two major changes were made to the text of proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(A)&mdash;one substantive and one stylistic. The substantive change was to increase the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; from 60 days to 150 days. The Appellate Rules Committee and the Civil Rules Committee had to balance two concerns that are implicated whenever a court fails to enter its final decision on a separate document. On the one hand, potential appellants need a clear signal that the time to appeal has begun to run, so that they do not unknowingly forfeit their rights. On the other hand, the time to appeal cannot be allowed to run forever. A party who receives no notice whatsoever of a judgment has only 180 days to move to reopen the time to appeal from that judgment. <em>See</em> Rule 4(a)(6)(A). It hardly seems fair to give a party who <em>does</em> receive notice of a judgment an unlimited amount of time to appeal, merely because that judgment was not set forth on a separate piece of paper. Potential appellees and the judicial system need <em>some</em> limit on the time within which appeals can be brought.</p>
<p class="note-body">The 150-day cap properly balances these two concerns. When an order is not set forth on a separate document, what signals litigants that the order is final and appealable is a lack of further activity from the court. A 60-day period of inactivity is not sufficiently rare to signal to litigants that the court has entered its last order. By contrast, 150 days of inactivity is much less common and thus more clearly signals to litigants that the court is done with their case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The major stylistic change to Rule 4(a)(7) requires some explanation. In the published draft, proposed Rule 4(a)(7)(A) provided that &ldquo;[a] judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(a) when it is entered for purposes of Rule 58(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&rdquo; In other words, Rule 4(a)(7)(A) told readers to look to FRCP 58(b) to ascertain when a judgment is entered for purposes of starting the running of time to appeal. Sending appellate lawyers to the civil rules to discover when time began to run for purposes of the appellate rules was itself somewhat awkward, but it was made more confusing by the fact that, when readers went to proposed FRCP 58(b), they found this introductory clause: &ldquo;Judgment is entered for purposes of Rules 50, 52, 54(d)(2)(B), 59, 60, and 62 when&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">This introductory clause was confusing for both appellate lawyers and trial lawyers. It was confusing for appellate lawyers because Rule 4(a)(7) informed them that FRCP 58(b) would tell them when the time begins to run for purposes of the <em>appellate</em> rules, but when they got to FRCP 58(b) they found a rule that, by its terms, dictated only when the time begins to run for purposes of certain <em>civil</em> rules. The introductory clause was confusing for trial lawyers because FRCP 58(b) described when judgment is entered for some purposes under the civil rules, but then was completely silent about when judgment is entered for other purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body">To avoid this confusion, the Civil Rules Committee, on the recommendation of the Appellate Rules Committee, changed the introductory clause in FRCP 58(b) to read simply: &ldquo;Judgment is entered for purposes of <em>these Rules</em> when&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; In addition, Rule 4(a)(7)(A) was redrafted [A redraft of Rule 4(a)(7) was faxed to members of the Appellate Rules Committee two weeks after our meeting in New Orleans. The Committee consented to the redraft without objection.] so that the triggering events for the running of the time to appeal (entry in the civil docket, and being set forth on a separate document or passage of 150 days) were incorporated directly into Rule 4(a)(7), rather than indirectly through a reference to FRCP 58(b). This eliminates the need for appellate lawyers to examine Rule 58(b) and any chance that Rule 58(b)'s introductory clause (even as modified) might confuse them.</p>
<p class="note-body">We do not believe that republication of Rule 4(a)(7) or FRCP 58 is necessary. In <em>substance</em>, rewritten Rule 4(a)(7)(A) and FRCP 58(b) operate identically to the published versions, except that the 60-day cap has been replaced with a 150-day cap&mdash;a change that was suggested by some of the commentators and that makes the cap more forgiving.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(5).</em> Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) permits a district court, acting within 7 days after the imposition of sentence, to correct an erroneous sentence in a criminal case. Some courts have held that the filing of a motion for correction of a sentence suspends the time for filing a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Carmouche</em>, 138 F.3d 1014, 1016 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Morillo</em>, 8 F.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir. 1993). Those courts establish conflicting timetables for appealing a judgment of conviction after the filing of a motion to correct a sentence. In the First Circuit, the time to appeal is suspended only for the period provided by Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) for the district court to correct a sentence; the time to appeal begins to run again once 7 days have passed after sentencing, even if the motion is still pending. By contrast, in the Fifth Circuit, the time to appeal does not begin to run again until the district court actually issues an order disposing of the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(b)(5) has been amended to eliminate the inconsistency concerning the effect of a motion to correct a sentence on the time for filing a notice of appeal. The amended rule makes clear that the time to appeal continues to run, even if a motion to correct a sentence is filed. The amendment is consistent with Rule 4(b)(3)(A), which lists the motions that toll the time to appeal, and notably omits any mention of a Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion. The amendment also should promote certainty and minimize the likelihood of confusion concerning the time to appeal a judgment of conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a district court corrects a sentence pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a), the time for filing a notice of appeal of the corrected sentence under Rule 4(b)(1) would begin to run when the court enters a new judgment reflecting the corrected sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> The reference to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) was changed to Rule 35(a) to reflect the pending amendment of Rule 35. The proposed amendment to Criminal Rule 35, if approved, will take effect at the same time that the proposed amendment to Appellate Rule 4 will take effect, if approved.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(a)(6) has permitted a district court to reopen the time to appeal a judgment or order upon finding that four conditions were satisfied. First, the district court had to find that the appellant did not receive notice of the entry of the judgment or order from the district court or any party within 21 days after the judgment or order was entered. Second, the district court had to find that the appellant moved to reopen the <!-- PDFPage:16 -->time to appeal within 7 days after the appellant received notice of the entry of the judgment or order. Third, the district court had to find that the appellant moved to reopen the time to appeal within 180 days after the judgment or order was entered. Finally, the district court had to find that no party would be prejudiced by the reopening of the time to appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(a)(6) has been amended to specify more clearly what type of &ldquo;notice&rdquo; of the entry of a judgment or order precludes a party from later moving to reopen the time to appeal. In addition, Rule 4(a)(6) has been amended to address confusion about what type of &ldquo;notice&rdquo; triggers the 7-day period to bring a motion to reopen. Finally, Rule 4(a)(6) has been reorganized to set forth more logically the conditions that must be met before a district court may reopen the time to appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6)(A).</em> Former subdivision (a)(6)(B) has been redesignated as subdivision (a)(6)(A), and one substantive change has been made. As amended, the subdivision will preclude a party from moving to reopen the time to appeal a judgment or order only if the party receives (within 21 days) formal notice of the entry of that judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d). No other type of notice will preclude a party.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reasons for this change take some explanation. Prior to 1998, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) permitted a district court to reopen the time to appeal if it found &ldquo;that a party entitled to notice of the entry of a judgment or order did not receive such notice from the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry.&rdquo; The rule was clear that the &ldquo;notice&rdquo; to which it referred was the notice required under Civil Rule 77(d), which must be served by the clerk pursuant to Civil Rule 5(b) and may also be served by a party pursuant to that same rule. In other words, prior to 1998, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) was clear that, if a party did not receive formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d), that party could later move to reopen the time to appeal (assuming that the other requirements of subdivision (a)(6) were met).</p>
<p class="note-body">In 1998, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) was amended to change the description of the type of notice that would preclude a party from moving to reopen. As a result of the amendment, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) no longer referred to the failure of the moving party to receive &ldquo;<em>such</em> notice&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the notice required by Civil Rule 77(d)&mdash;but instead referred to the failure of the moving party to receive &ldquo;<em>the</em> notice.&rdquo; And former subdivision (a)(6)(B) no longer referred to the failure of the moving party to receive notice from &ldquo;the <em>clerk</em> or any party,&rdquo; both of whom are explicitly mentioned in Civil Rule 77(d). Rather, former subdivision (a)(6)(B) referred to the failure of the moving party to receive notice from &ldquo;the <em>district court</em> or any party.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The 1998 amendment meant, then, that the type of notice that precluded a party from moving to reopen the time to appeal was no longer limited to Civil Rule 77(d) notice. Under the 1998 amendment, <em>some</em> type of notice, in addition to Civil Rule 77(d) notice, precluded a party. But the text of the amended rule did not make clear what type of notice qualified. This was an invitation for litigation, confusion, and possible circuit splits.</p>
<p class="note-body">To avoid such problems, former subdivision (a)(6)(B)&mdash;new subdivision (a)(6)(A)&mdash;has been amended to restore its pre-1998 simplicity. Under new subdivision (a)(6)(A), if the court finds that the moving party was not notified under Civil Rule 77(d) of the entry of the judgment or order that the party seeks to appeal within 21 days after that judgment or order was entered, then the court is authorized to reopen the time to appeal (if all of the other requirements of subdivision (a)(6) are met). Because Civil Rule 77(d) requires that notice of the entry of a Judgment or order be formally served under Civil Rule 5(b), any notice that is not so served will not operate to preclude the reopening of the time to appeal under new subdivision (a)(6)(A).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6)(B).</em> Former subdivision (a)(6)(A) required a party to move to reopen the time to appeal &ldquo;within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry [of the judgment or order sought to be appealed].&rdquo; Former subdivision (a)(6)(A) has been redesignated as subdivision (a)(6)(B), and one important substantive change has been made: The subdivision now makes clear that only formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d) will trigger the 7-day period to move to reopen the time to appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The circuits have been split over what type of &ldquo;notice&rdquo; is sufficient to trigger the 7-day period. The majority of circuits that addressed the question held that only <em>written</em> notice was sufficient, although nothing in the text of the rule suggested such a limitation. <em>See, e.g., Bass v. United States Dep't of Agric.</em>, 211 F.3d 959, 963 (5th Cir. 2000). By contrast, the Ninth Circuit held that while former subdivision (a)(6)(A) did not require written notice, &ldquo;the quality of the communication [had to] rise to the functional equivalent of written notice.&rdquo; <em>Nguyen v. Southwest Leasing & Rental, Inc.</em>, 282 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir. 2002). Other circuits suggested in dicta that former subdivision (a)(6)(A) required only &ldquo;actual notice,&rdquo; which, presumably, could have included oral notice that was not &ldquo;the functional equivalent of written notice.&rdquo; <em>See, e.g., Lowry v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.</em>, 211 F.3d 457, 464 (8th Cir. 2000). And still other circuits read into former subdivision (a)(6)(A) restrictions that appeared only in former subdivision (a)(6)(B) (such as the requirement that notice be received &ldquo;from the district court or any party,&rdquo; <em>see Benavides v. Bureau of Prisons</em>, 79 F.3d 1211, 1214 (D.C. Cir. 1996)) or that appeared in neither former subdivision (a)(6)(A) nor former subdivision (a)(6)(B) (such as the requirement that notice be served in the manner prescribed by Civil Rule 5, <em>see Ryan v. First Unum Life Ins. Co.</em>, 174 F.3d 302, 304&ndash;05 (2d Cir. 1999)).</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (a)(6)(A)&mdash;new subdivision (a)(6)(B)&mdash;has been amended to resolve this circuit split by providing that only formal notice of the entry of a judgment or order under Civil Rule 77(d) will trigger the 7-day period. Using Civil Rule 77(d) notice as the trigger has two advantages: First, because Civil Rule 77(d) is clear and familiar, circuit splits are unlikely to develop over its meaning. Second, because Civil Rule 77(d) notice must be served under Civil Rule 5(b), establishing whether and when such notice was provided should generally not be difficult.</p>
<p class="note-body">Using Civil Rule 77(d) notice to trigger the 7-day period will not unduly delay appellate proceedings. Rule 4(a)(6) applies to only a small number of cases&mdash;cases in which a party was not notified of a judgment or order by either the clerk or another party within 21 days after entry. Even with respect to those cases, an appeal cannot be brought more than 180 days after entry, no matter what the circumstances. In addition, Civil Rule 77(d) permits parties to serve notice of the entry of a judgment or order. The winning party can prevent Rule 4(a)(6) from even coming into play simply by serving notice of entry within 21 days. Failing that, the winning party can always trigger the 7-day deadline to move to reopen by serving belated notice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No change was made to the text of subdivision (A)&mdash;regarding the type of notice that precludes a party from later moving to reopen the time to appeal&mdash;and only minor stylistic changes were made to the Committee Note to subdivision (A).</p>
<p class="note-body">A substantial change was made to subdivision (B)&mdash;regarding the type of notice that triggers the 7-day deadline for moving to reopen the time to appeal. Under the published version of subdivision (B), the 7-day deadline would have been triggered when &ldquo;the moving party receives or observes written notice of the entry from any source.&rdquo; The Committee was attempting to implement an &ldquo;eyes/ears&rdquo; distinction: The 7-day period was triggered when a party learned of the entry of a judgment or order by reading about it (whether on a piece of paper or a computer screen), but was not triggered when a party merely heard about it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Above all else, subdivision (B) should be clear and easy to apply; it should neither risk opening another circuit split over its meaning nor create the need for a <!-- PDFPage:17 -->lot of factfinding by district courts. After considering the public comments&mdash;and, in particular, the comments of two committees of the California bar&mdash;the Committee decided that subdivision (B) could do better on both counts. The published standard&mdash;&ldquo;receives or observes written notice of the entry from any source&rdquo;&mdash;was awkward and, despite the guidance of the Committee Note, was likely to give courts problems. Even if the standard had proved to be sufficiently clear, district courts would still have been left to make factual findings about whether a particular attorney or party &ldquo;received&rdquo; or &ldquo;observed&rdquo; notice that was written or electronic.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee concluded that the solution suggested by the California bar&mdash;using Civil Rule 77(d) notice to trigger the 7-day period&mdash;made a lot of sense. The standard is clear; no one doubts what it means to be served with notice of the entry of judgment under Civil Rule 77(d). The standard is also unlikely to give rise to many factual disputes. Civil Rule 77(d) notice must be formally served under Civil Rule 5(b), so establishing the presence or absence of such notice should be relatively easy. And, for the reasons described in the Committee Note, using Civil Rule 77(d) as the trigger will not unduly delay appellate proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">For these reasons, the Committee amended subdivision (B) so that the 7-day deadline will be triggered only by notice of the entry of a judgment or order that is served under Civil Rule 77(d). (Corresponding changes were made to the Committee Note.) The Committee does not believe that the amendment needs to be published again for comment, as the issue of what type of notice should trigger the 7-day deadline has already been addressed by commentators, the revised version of subdivision (B) is far more forgiving than the published version, and it is highly unlikely that the revised version will be found ambiguous in any respect.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii).</em> Subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii) is amended to address problems that stemmed from the adoption&mdash;during the 1998 restyling project&mdash;of language referring to &ldquo;a judgment altered or amended upon&rdquo; a post-trial motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Prior to the restyling, subdivision (a)(4) instructed that &ldquo;[a]ppellate review of an order disposing of any of [the post-trial motions listed in subdivision (a)(4)] requires the party, in compliance with Appellate Rule 3(c), to amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A party intending to challenge an alteration or amendment of the judgment shall file a notice, or amended notice, of appeal within the time prescribed by this Rule 4 measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such motion outstanding.&rdquo; After the restyling, subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii) provided: &ldquo;A party intending to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment altered or amended upon such a motion, must file a notice of appeal, or an amended notice of appeal&mdash;in compliance with Rule 3(c)&mdash;within the time prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">One court has explained that the 1998 amendment introduced ambiguity into the Rule: &ldquo;The new formulation could be read to expand the obligation to file an amended notice to circumstances where the ruling on the post-trial motion alters the prior judgment in an insignificant manner or in a manner favorable to the appellant, even though the appeal is not directed against the alteration of the judgment.&rdquo; <em>Sorensen v. City of New York</em>, 413 F.3d 292, 296 n.2 (2d Cir. 2005). The current amendment removes that ambiguous reference to &ldquo;a judgment altered or amended upon&rdquo; a post-trial motion, and refers instead to &ldquo;a judgment's alteration or amendment&rdquo; upon such a motion. Thus, subdivision (a)(4)(B)(ii) requires a new or amended notice of appeal when an appellant wishes to challenge an order disposing of a motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A) or a judgment's alteration or amendment upon such a motion.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment.</em> No changes were made to the proposal as published. Instead, the Committee has added the commentators&rsquo; suggestions to its study agenda.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi).</em> Subdivision (a)(4) provides that certain timely post-trial motions extend the time for filing an appeal. Lawyers sometimes move under Civil Rule 60 for relief that is still available under another rule such as Civil Rule 59. Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) provides for such eventualities by extending the time for filing an appeal so long as the Rule 60 motion is filed within a limited time. Formerly, the time limit under subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) was 10 days, reflecting the 10-day limits for making motions under Civil Rules 50(b), 52(b), and 59. Subdivision (a)(4)(A)(vi) now contains a 28-day limit to match the revisions to the time limits in the Civil Rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)(C).</em> The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6)(B).</em> The time set in the former rule at 7 days has been revised to 14 days. Under the time-computation approach set by former Rule 26(a), &ldquo;7 days&rdquo; always meant at least 9 days and could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends and holidays are counted. Changing the period from 7 to 14 days offsets the change in computation approach. See the Note to Rule 26.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(3)(A).</em> The times set in the former rule at 10 days have been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Petition for Permission to Appeal.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To request permission to appeal when an appeal is within the court of appeals&rsquo; discretion, a party must file a petition for permission to appeal. The petition must be filed with the circuit clerk with proof of service on all other parties to the district-court action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The petition must be filed within the time specified by the statute or rule authorizing the appeal or, if no such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If a party cannot petition for appeal unless the district court first enters an order granting permission to do so or stating that the necessary conditions are met, the district court may amend its order, either on its own or in response to a party's motion, to include the required permission or statement. In that event, the time to petition runs from entry of the amended order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents of the Petition; Answer or Cross-Petition; Oral Argument.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The petition must include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the question itself;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the relief sought;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the reasons why the appeal should be allowed and is authorized by a statute or rule; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:18 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) an attached copy of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the order, decree, or judgment complained of and any related opinion or memorandum, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any order stating the district court's permission to appeal or finding that the necessary conditions are met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A party may file an answer in opposition or a cross-petition within 10 days after the petition is served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The petition and answer will be submitted without oral argument unless the court of appeals orders otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Form of Papers; Number of Copies.</cap-smallcap> All papers must conform to Rule 32(c)(2). Except by the court's permission, a paper must not exceed 20 pages, exclusive of the disclosure statement, the proof of service, and the accompanying documents required by Rule 5(b)(1)(E). An original and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Grant of Permission; Fees; Cost Bond; Filing the Record.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Within 14 days after the entry of the order granting permission to appeal, the appellant must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pay the district clerk all required fees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) file a cost bond if required under Rule 7.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A notice of appeal need not be filed. The date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal for calculating time under these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The district clerk must notify the circuit clerk once the petitioner has paid the fees. Upon receiving this notice, the circuit clerk must enter the appeal on the docket. The record must be forwarded and filed in accordance with Rules 11 and 12(c).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived in the main from Third Circuit Rule 11(2), which is similar to the rule governing appeals under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b) in a majority of the circuits. The second sentence of subdivision (a) resolves a conflict over the question of whether the district court can amend an order by supplying the statement required by &sect;1292(b) at any time after entry of the order, with the result that the time fixed by the statute commences to run on the date of entry of the order as amended. Compare <em>Milbert v. Bison Laboratories</em>, 260 F.2d 431 (3d Cir., 1958) with <em>Sperry Rand Corporation v. Bell Telephone Laboratories</em>, 272 F.2d (2d Cir., 1959), <em>Hadjipateras v. Pacifica, S.A</em>., 290 F.2d 697 (5th Cir., 1961), and <em>Houston Fearless Corporation v. Teter</em>, 313 F.2d 91 (10th Cir., 1962). The view taken by the Second, Fifth and Tenth Circuits seems theoretically and practically sound, and the rule adopts it. Although a majority of the circuits now require the filing of a notice of appeal following the grant of permission to appeal, filing of the notice serves no function other than to provide a time from which the time for transmitting the record and docketing the appeal begins to run.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals from interlocutory orders under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b) the provisions of proposed Rule 3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in the district court upon the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to proposed amended Rule 3(e), supra.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment makes it clear that a court may require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In 1992 Congress added subsection (e) to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292. Subsection (e) says that the Supreme Court has power to prescribe rules that &ldquo;provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for&rdquo; in section 1292. The amendment of Rule 5 was prompted by the possibility of new rules authorizing additional interlocutory appeals. Rather than add a separate rule governing each such appeal, the Committee believes it is preferable to amend Rule 5 so that is will govern all such appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104&ndash;317, abolished appeals by permission under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(5), making Rule 5.1 obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">This new Rule 5 is intended to govern all discretionary appeals from district-court orders, judgments, or decrees. At this time that includes interlocutory appeals under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b), (c)(1), and (d)(1) & (2). If additional interlocutory appeals are authorized under &sect;1292(e), the new Rule is intended to govern them if the appeals are discretionary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> Paragraph (a)(1) says that when granting an appeal is within a court of appeals&rsquo; discretion, a party may file a petition for permission to appeal. The time for filing provision states only that the petition must be filed within the time provided in the statute or rule authorizing the appeal or, if no such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1292(b), (c), and (d) provide that the petition must be filed within 10 days after entry of the order containing the statement prescribed in the statute. Existing Rule 5(a) provides that if a district court amends an order to contain the prescribed statement, the petition must be filed within 10 days after entry of the amended order. The new rule similarly says that if a party cannot petition without the district court's permission or statement that necessary circumstances are present, the district court may amend its order to include such a statement and the time to petition runs from the entry of the amended order.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision that the Rule 4(a) time for filing a notice of appeal should apply if the statute or rule is silent about the filing time was drawn from existing Rule 5.1.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> The changes made in the provisions in paragraph (b)(1) are intended only to broaden them sufficiently to make them appropriate for all discretionary appeals.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:19 --><p class="note-body">In paragraph (b)(2) a uniform time&mdash;7 days&mdash;is established for filing an answer in opposition or cross-petition. Seven days is the time for responding under existing Rule 5 and is an appropriate length of time when dealing with an interlocutory appeal. Although existing Rule 5.1 provides 14 days for responding, the Committee does not believe that the longer response time is necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> Subdivision (c) is substantively unchanged.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d).</em> Paragraph (d)(2) is amended to state that &ldquo;the date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal&rdquo; for purposes of calculating time under the rules. That language simply clarifies existing practice.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> A petition for permission to appeal, a cross-petition for permission to appeal, and an answer to a petition or cross-petition for permission to appeal are all &ldquo;other papers&rdquo; for purposes of Rule 32(c)(2), and all of the requirements of Rule 32(a) apply to those papers, except as provided in Rule 32(c)(2). During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 5(c) was inadvertently changed to suggest that only the requirements of Rule 32(a)(1) apply to such papers. Rule 5(c) has been amended to correct that error.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(c) has been further amended to limit the length of papers filed under Rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2).</em> Subdivision (b)(2) is amended in the light of the change in Rule 26(a)'s time computation rules. Subdivision (b)(2) formerly required that an answer in opposition to a petition for permission to appeal, or a cross-petition for permission to appeal, be filed &ldquo;within 7 days after the petition is served.&rdquo; Under former Rule 26(a), &ldquo;7 days&rdquo; always meant at least 9 days and could mean as many as 11 or even 13 days. Under current Rule 26(a), intermediate weekends and holidays are counted. Changing the period from 7 to 10 days offsets the change in computation approach. See the Note to Rule 26.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(1).</em> The time set in the former rule at 10 days has been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 26.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Appeal From a Judgment, Order, or Decree of a District Court Exercising Original Jurisdiction in a Bankruptcy Case.</cap-smallcap> An appeal to a court of appeals from a final judgment, order, or decree of a district court exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1334 is taken as any other civil appeal under these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Appeal From a Judgment, Order, or Decree of a District Court or Bankruptcy Appellate Panel Exercising Appellate Jurisdiction in a Bankruptcy Case.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Applicability of Other Rules.</em> These rules apply to an appeal to a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(d) from a final judgment, order, or decree of a district court or bankruptcy appellate panel exercising appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(a) or (b). But there are 3 exceptions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Rules 4(a)(4), 4(b), 9, 10, 11, 12(b), 13&ndash;20, 22&ndash;23, and 24(b) do not apply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the reference in Rule 3(c) to &ldquo;Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms&rdquo; must be read as a reference to Form 5; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) when the appeal is from a bankruptcy appellate panel, the term &ldquo;district court,&rdquo; as used in any applicable rule, means &ldquo;appellate panel.&rdquo;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Additional Rules.</em> In addition to the rules made applicable by Rule 6(b)(1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Motion for Rehearing.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If a timely motion for rehearing under Bankruptcy Rule 8015 is filed, the time to appeal for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion. A notice of appeal filed after the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel announces or enters a judgment, order, or decree&mdash;but before disposition of the motion for rehearing&mdash;becomes effective when the order disposing of the motion for rehearing is entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Appellate review of the order disposing of the motion requires the party, in compliance with Rules 3(c) and 6(b)(1)(B), to amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A party intending to challenge an altered or amended judgment, order, or decree must file a notice of appeal or amended notice of appeal within the time prescribed by Rule 4&mdash;excluding Rules 4(a)(4) and 4(b)&mdash;measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) No additional fee is required to file an amended notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>The record on appeal.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Within 14 days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant must file with the clerk possessing the record assembled in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 8006&mdash;and serve on the appellee&mdash;a statement of the issues to be presented on appeal and a designation of the record to be certified and sent to the circuit clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) An appellee who believes that other parts of the record are necessary must, within 14 days after being served with the appellant's designation, file with the clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to be included.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The record on appeal consists of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">&bull; the redesignated record as provided above;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">&bull; the proceedings in the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">&bull; a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk under Rule 3(d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Forwarding the Record.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) When the record is complete, the district clerk or bankruptcy appellate panel clerk must number the documents constituting the record and send them promptly to the circuit clerk together <!-- PDFPage:20 -->with a list of the documents correspondingly numbered and reasonably identified. Unless directed to do so by a party or the circuit clerk, the clerk will not send to the court of appeals documents of unusual bulk or weight, physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the record designated for omission by local rule of the court of appeals. If the exhibits are unusually bulky or heavy, a party must arrange with the clerks in advance for their transportation and receipt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) All parties must do whatever else is necessary to enable the clerk to assemble and forward the record. The court of appeals may provide by rule or order that a certified copy of the docket entries be sent in place of the redesignated record, but any party may request at any time during the pendency of the appeal that the redesignated record be sent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Filing the Record.</em> Upon receiving the record&mdash;or a certified copy of the docket entries sent in place of the redesignated record&mdash;the circuit clerk must file it and immediately notify all parties of the filing date.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is substantially a restatement of present procedure. See D.C. Cir. Rule 34; 6th Cir. Rule 11; 7th Cir. Rule 10(d); 10th Cir. Rule 13.</p>
<p class="note-body">Present circuit rules commonly provide that the petition for allowance of an appeal shall be filed within the time allowed by Section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act for taking appeals of right. For the reasons explained in the Note accompanying Rule 4, that rule makes the time for appeal in bankruptcy cases the same as that which obtains in other civil cases and thus supersedes Section 25. Thus the present rule simply continues the former practice of making the time for filing the petition in appeals by allowance the same as that provided for filing the notice of appeal in appeals of right.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals by allowance in bankruptcy proceedings the provisions of proposed Rule 3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in the district court at the time of the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to Rule 3(e), supra.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A new Rule 6 is proposed. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95&ndash;598, 92 Stat. 2549, the Supreme Court decision in <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co</em>., 458 U.S. 50 (1982), and the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98&ndash;353, 98 Stat. 333, have made the existing Rule 6 obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Subdivision (a) provides that when a district court exercises original jurisdiction in a bankruptcy matter, rather than referring it to a bankruptcy judge for a final determination, the appeal should be taken in identical fashion as appeals from district court decisions in other civil actions. A district court exercises original jurisdiction and this subdivision applies when the district court enters a final order or judgment upon consideration of a bankruptcy judge's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a non-core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;157(c)(1) or when a district court withdraws a proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;157(d). This subdivision is included to avoid uncertainty arising from the question of whether a bankruptcy case is a civil case. The rules refer at various points to the procedure &ldquo;in a civil case&rdquo;, <em>see</em>, e.g. Rule 4(a)(1). Subdivision (a) makes it clear that such rules apply to an appeal from a district court bankruptcy decision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Subdivision (b) governs appeals that follow intermediate review of a bankruptcy judge's decision by a district court or a bankruptcy appellate panel.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)</em>. Subdivision (b)(1) provides for the general applicability of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, with specified exceptions, to appeals covered by subdivision (b) and makes necessary word adjustments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)</em>. Paragraph (i) provides that the time for filing a notice of appeal shall begin to run anew from the entry of an order denying a rehearing or from the entry of a subsequent judgment. The Committee deliberately omitted from the rule any provision governing the validity of a notice of appeal filed prior to the entry of an order denying a rehearing; the Committee intended to leave undisturbed the current state of the law on that issue. Paragraph (ii) calls for a redesignation of the appellate record assembled in the bankruptcy court pursuant to Rule 8006 of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. After an intermediate appeal, a party may well narrow the focus of its efforts on the second appeal and a redesignation of the record may eliminate unnecessary material. The proceedings during the first appeal are included to cover the possibility that independent error in the intermediate appeal, for example failure to follow appropriate procedures, may be assigned in the court of appeals. Paragraph (iii) provides for the transmission of the record and tracks the appropriate subsections of Rule 11. Paragraph (iv) provides for the filing of the record and notices to the parties. Paragraph (ii) and Paragraph (iv) both refer to &ldquo;a certified copy of the docket entries&rdquo;. The &ldquo;docket entries&rdquo; referred to are the docket entries in the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel, not the entire docket in the bankruptcy court.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Note to Subparagraph (b)(2)(i). The amendment accompanies concurrent changes to Rule 4(a)(4). Although Rule 6 never included language such as that being changed in Rule 4(a)(4), language that made a notice of appeal void if it was filed before, or during the pendency of, certain posttrial motions, courts have found that a notice of appeal is premature if it is filed before the court disposes of a motion for rehearing. <em>See, e.g., In re X-Cel, Inc</em>., 823 F.2d 192 (7th Cir. 1987); <em>In re Shah</em>, 859 F.2d 1463 (10th Cir. 1988). The Committee wants to achieve the same result here as in Rule 4, the elimination of a procedural trap.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> Language is added to Rule 6(b)(2)(A)(ii) to conform with the corresponding provision in Rule 4(a)(4). The new language is clarifying rather than substantive. The existing rule states that a party intending to challenge an alteration or amendment of a judgment must file an amended notice of appeal. Of course if a party has not previously filed a notice of appeal, the party would simply file a notice of appeal not an amended one. The new language states <!-- PDFPage:21 -->that the party must file &ldquo;a notice of appeal or amended notice of appeal.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendment would eliminate the provision of the present rule that requires the appellant to file a $250 bond for costs on appeal at the time of filing his notice of appeal. The $250 provision was carried forward in the F.R.App.P. from former Rule 73(c) of the F.R.Civ.P., and the $250 figure has remained unchanged since the adoption of that rule in 1937. Today it bears no relationship to actual costs. The amended rule would leave the question of the need for a bond for costs and its amount in the discretion of the court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Motion for Stay.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Initial Motion in the District Court.</em> A party must ordinarily move first in the district court for the following relief:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) approval of a supersedeas bond; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Motion in the Court of Appeals; Conditions on Relief.</em> A motion for the relief mentioned in Rule 8(a)(1) may be made to the court of appeals or to one of its judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The motion must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) show that moving first in the district court would be impracticable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) state that, a motion having been made, the district court denied the motion or failed to afford the relief requested and state any reasons given by the district court for its action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The motion must also include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) relevant parts of the record.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A motion under this Rule 8(a)(2) must be filed with the circuit clerk and normally will be considered by a panel of the court. But in an exceptional case in which time requirements make that procedure impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a single judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The court may condition relief on a party's filing a bond or other appropriate security in the district court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Proceeding Against a Surety.</cap-smallcap> If a party gives security in the form of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction of the district court and irrevocably appoints the district clerk as the surety's agent on whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. On motion, a surety's liability may be enforced in the district court without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and any notice that the district court prescribes may be served on the district clerk, who must promptly mail a copy to each surety whose address is known.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. While the power of a court of appeals to stay proceedings in the district court during the pendency of an appeal is not explicitly conferred by statute, it exists by virtue of the all writs statute, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651. <em>Eastern Greyhound Lines v. Fusco</em>, 310 F.2d 632 (6th Cir., 1962); <em>United States v. Lynd</em>, 301 F.2d 818 (5th Cir., 1962); <em>Public Utilities Commission of Dist. of Col. v. Capital Transit Co</em>., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 214 F.2d 242 (1954). And the Supreme Court has termed the power &ldquo;inherent&rdquo; (<em>In re McKenzie</em>, 180 U.S. 536, 551, 21 S.Ct. 468, 45 L.Ed. 657 (1901)) and &ldquo;part of its (the court of appeals) traditional equipment for the administration of justice.&rdquo; (<em>Scripps-Howard Radio v. F.C.C</em>., 316 U.S. 4, 9&ndash;10, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942)). The power of a single judge of the court of appeals to grant a stay pending appeal was recognized in <em>In re McKenzie, supra. Alexander v. United States</em>, 173 F.2d 865 (9th Cir., 1949) held that a single judge could not stay the judgment of a district court, but it noted the absence of a rule of court authorizing the practice. FRCP 62(g) adverts to the grant of a stay by a single judge of the appellate court. The requirement that application be first made to the district court is the case law rule. <em>Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission</em>, 260 U.S. 212, 219, 43 S.Ct. 75, 67 L.Ed. 217 (1922); <em>United States v. El-O-Pathic Pharmacy</em>, 192 F.2d 62 (9th Cir., 1951); <em>United States v. Hansell</em>, 109 F.2d 613 (2d Cir., 1940). The requirement is explicitly stated in FRCrP 38(c) and in the rules of the First, Third, Fourth and Tenth Circuits. See also Supreme Court Rules 18 and 27.</p>
<p class="note-body">The statement of the requirement in the proposed rule would work a minor change in present practice. FRCP 73(e) requires that if a bond for costs on appeal or a supersedeas bond is offered after the appeal is docketed, leave to file the bond must be obtained from the court of appeals. There appears to be no reason why <!-- PDFPage:22 -->matters relating to supersedeas and cost bonds should not be initially presented to the district court whenever they arise prior to the disposition of the appeal. The requirement of FRCP 73(e) appears to be a concession to the view that once an appeal is perfected, the district court loses all power over its judgment. See <em>In re Federal Facilities Trust, </em>227 F.2d 651 (7th Cir., 1955) and cases&mdash;cited at 654&ndash;655. No reason appears why all questions related to supersedeas or the bond for costs on appeal should not be presented in the first instance to the district court in the ordinary case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The provisions respecting a surety upon a bond or other undertaking are based upon FRCP 65.1.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Release Before Judgment of Conviction.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The district court must state in writing, or orally on the record, the reasons for an order regarding the release or detention of a defendant in a criminal case. A party appealing from the order must file with the court of appeals a copy of the district court's order and the court's statement of reasons as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal. An appellant who questions the factual basis for the district court's order must file a transcript of the release proceedings or an explanation of why a transcript was not obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) After reasonable notice to the appellee, the court of appeals must promptly determine the appeal on the basis of the papers, affidavits, and parts of the record that the parties present or the court requires. Unless the court so orders, briefs need not be filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The court of appeals or one of its judges may order the defendant's release pending the disposition of the appeal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Release After Judgment of Conviction.</cap-smallcap> A party entitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of conviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in the court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. Both the order and the review are subject to Rule 9(a). The papers filed by the party seeking review must include a copy of the judgment of conviction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Release.</cap-smallcap> The court must make its decision regarding release in accordance with the applicable provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3142, 3143, and 3145(c).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The appealability of release orders entered prior to a judgment of conviction is determined by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3147, as qualified by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148, and by the rule announced in <em>Stack v. Boyle</em>, 342 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3 (1951), holding certain orders respecting release appealable as final orders under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1291. The language of the rule, &ldquo;(an)n appeal authorized by law from an order refusing or imposing conditions of release,&rdquo; is intentionally broader than that used in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3147 in describing orders made appealable by that section. The summary procedure ordained by the rule is intended to apply to all appeals from orders respecting release, and it would appear that at least some orders not made appealable by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3147 are nevertheless appealable under the <em>Stack v. Boyle</em> rationale. See, for example, <em>United States v. Foster</em>, 278 F.2d 567 (2d Cir., 1960), holding appealable an order refusing to extend bail limits. Note also the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148, which after withdrawing from persons charged with an offense punishable by death and from those who have been convicted of an offense the right of appeal granted by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3147, expressly preserves &ldquo;other rights to judicial review of conditions of release or orders of detention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the subdivision is to insure the expeditious determination of appeals respecting release orders, an expedition commanded by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3147 and by the Court in <em>Stack v. Boyle</em>, supra. It permits such appeals to be heard on an informal record without the necessity of briefs and on reasonable notice. Equally important to the just and speedy disposition of these appeals is the requirement that the district court state the reasons for its decision. See <em>Jones v. United States</em>, 358 F.2d 543 (D.C. Cir., 1966); <em>Rhodes v. United States</em>, 275 F.2d 78 (4th Cir., 1960); <em>United States v. Williams</em>, 253 F.2d 144 (7th Cir., 1958).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This subdivision regulates procedure for review of an order respecting release at a time when the jurisdiction of the court of appeals has already attached by virtue of an appeal from the judgment of conviction. Notwithstanding the fact that jurisdiction has passed to the court of appeals, both 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148 and FRCrP 38(c) contemplate that the initial determination of whether a convicted defendant is to be released pending the appeal is to be made by the district court. But at this point there is obviously no need for a separate appeal from the order of the district court respecting release. The court of appeals or a judge thereof has power to effect release on motion as an incident to the pending appeal. See FRCrP 38(c) and 46(a)(2). But the motion is functionally identical with the appeal regulated by subdivision (a) and requires the same speedy determination if relief is to be effective. Hence the similarity of the procedure outlined in the two subdivisions.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is intended to bring the rule into conformity with 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148 and to allocate to the de<!-- PDFPage:23 -->fendant the burden of establishing that he will not flee and that he poses no danger to any other person or to the community. The burden is placed upon the defendant in the view that the fact of his conviction justifies retention in custody in situations where doubt exists as to whether he can be safely released pending disposition of his appeal. Release pending appeal may also be denied if &ldquo;it appears that an appeal is frivolous or taken for delay.&rdquo; 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148. The burden of establishing the existence of these criteria remains with the government.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 9 has been entirely rewritten. The basic structure of the rule has been retained. Subdivision (a) governs appeals from bail decisions made before the judgment of conviction is entered at the time of sentencing. Subdivision (b) governs review of bail decisions made after sentencing and pending appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The subdivision applies to appeals from &ldquo;an order regarding release or detention&rdquo; of a criminal defendant before judgment of conviction, <em>i.e</em>., before sentencing. <em>See</em> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32. The old rule applied only to a defendant's appeal from an order &ldquo;refusing or imposing conditions of release.&rdquo; The new broader language is needed because the government is now permitted to appeal bail decisions in certain circumstances. 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3145 and 3731. For the same reason, the rule now requires a district court to state reasons for its decision in all instances, not only when it refuses release or imposes conditions on release.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule requires a party appealing from a district court's decision to supply the court of appeals with a copy of the district court's order and its statement of reasons. In addition, an appellant who questions the factual basis for the district court's decision must file a transcript of the release proceedings, if possible. The rule also permits a court to require additional papers. A court must act promptly to decide these appeals; lack of pertinent information can cause delays. The old rule left the determination of what should be filed entirely within the party's discretion; it stated that the court of appeals would hear the appeal &ldquo;upon such papers, affidavits, and portions of the record as the parties shall present.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This subdivision applies to review of a district court's decision regarding release made after judgment of conviction. As in subdivision (a), the language has been changed to accommodate the government's ability to seek review.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;review&rdquo; is used in this subdivision, rather than &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; because review may be obtained, in some instances, upon motion. Review may be obtained by motion if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction. If the party desiring review of the release decision has not filed such a notice of appeal, review may be obtained only by filing a notice of appeal from the order regarding release.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirements of subdivision (a) apply to both the order and the review. That is, the district court must state its reasons for the order. The party seeking review must supply the court of appeals with the same information required by subdivision (a). In addition, the party seeking review must also supply the court with information about the conviction and the sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This subdivision has been amended to include references to the correct statutory provisions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body">1984&mdash;Subd. (c). Pub. L. 98&ndash;473 substituted &ldquo;3143&rdquo; for &ldquo;3148&rdquo; and inserted &ldquo;and that the appeal is not for purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal or in an order for a new trial&rdquo; after &ldquo;community&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Composition of the Record on Appeal.</cap-smallcap> The following items constitute the record on appeal:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the transcript of proceedings, if any; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the district clerk.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>The Transcript of Proceedings.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Appellant's Duty to Order.</em> Within 14 days after filing the notice of appeal or entry of an order disposing of the last timely remaining motion of a type specified in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), whichever is later, the appellant must do either of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers necessary, subject to a local rule of the court of appeals and with the following qualifications:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the order must be in writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the cost of the transcript is to be paid by the United States under the Criminal Justice Act, the order must so state; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the appellant must, within the same period, file a copy of the order with the district clerk; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) file a certificate stating that no transcript will be ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Unsupported Finding or Conclusion.</em> If the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Partial Transcript.</em> Unless the entire transcript is ordered:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the appellant must&mdash;within the 14 days provided in Rule 10(b)(1)&mdash;file a statement of the issues that the appellant intends to present on the appeal and must serve on the appellee a copy of both the order or certificate and the statement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the appellee considers it necessary to have a transcript of other parts of the proceedings, the appellee must, within 14 days after the service of the order or certificate and the statement of the issues, file and serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to be ordered; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) unless within 14 days after service of that designation the appellant has ordered all such parts, and has so notified the appellee, the appellee may within the following 14 days either order the parts or move in the district court for an order requiring the appellant to do so.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Payment.</em> At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Statement of the Evidence When the Proceedings Were Not Recorded or When a <!-- PDFPage:24 -->Transcript Is Unavailable.</cap-smallcap> If the transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement must be served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the district court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the district clerk in the record on appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Agreed Statement as the Record on Appeal.</cap-smallcap> In place of the record on appeal as defined in Rule 10(a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the district court a statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the district court. The statement must set forth only those facts averred and proved or sought to be proved that are essential to the courts resolution of the issues. If the statement is truthful, it&mdash;together with any additions that the district court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues on appeal&mdash;must be approved by the district court and must then be certified to the court of appeals as the record on appeal. The district clerk must then send it to the circuit clerk within the time provided by Rule 11. A copy of the agreed statement may be filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 30.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Correction or Modification of the Record.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If any difference arises about whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the district court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by that court and the record conformed accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be certified and forwarded:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on stipulation of the parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by the district court before or after the record has been forwarded; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by the court of appeals.</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendments to Rule 10(b) would require the appellant to place with the reporter a written order for the transcript of proceedings and file a copy with the clerk, and to indicate on the order if the transcript is to be provided under the Criminal Justice Act. If the appellant does not plan to order a transcript of any of the proceedings, he must file a certificate to that effect. These requirements make the appellant's steps in readying the appeal a matter of record and give the district court notice of requests for transcripts at the expense of the United States under the Criminal Justice Act. They are also the third step in giving the court of appeals some control over the production and transmission of the record. See Note to Rules 3(d)(e) above and Rule 11 below.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the event the appellant orders no transcript, or orders a transcript of less than all the proceedings, the procedure under the proposed amended rule remains substantially as before. The appellant must serve on the appellee a copy of his order or in the event no order is placed, of the certificate to that effect, and a statement of the issues he intends to present on appeal, and the appellee may thereupon designate additional parts of the transcript to be included, and upon appellant's refusal to order the additional parts, may either order them himself or seek an order requiring the appellant to order them. The only change proposed in this procedure is to place a 10 day time limit on motions to require the appellant to order the additional portions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 10(b) is made subject to local rules of the courts of appeals in recognition of the practice in some circuits in some classes of cases, e. g., appeals by indigents in criminal cases after a short trial, of ordering immediate preparation of a complete transcript, thus making compliance with the rule unnecessary.</p>

The purpose of this amendment is to suspend the 10-day period for ordering a transcript if a timely postjudgment motion is made and a notice of appeal is suspended under Rule 4(a)(4). The 10-day period set forth in the first sentence of this rule begins to run when the order disposing of the last of such postjudgment motions outstanding is entered.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Reporter's Duty to Prepare and File a Transcript.</em> The reporter must prepare and file a transcript as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Upon receiving an order for a transcript, the reporter must enter at the foot of the order the date of its receipt and the expected completion date and send a copy, so endorsed, to the circuit clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days of the reporters receipt of the order, the reporter may request the circuit clerk to grant additional time to complete it. The clerk must note on the docket the action taken and notify the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) When a transcript is complete, the reporter must file it with the district clerk and notify the circuit clerk of the filing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If the reporter fails to file the transcript on time, the circuit clerk must notify the district judge and do whatever else the court of appeals directs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>District Clerk's Duty to Forward.</em> When the record is complete, the district clerk must number the documents constituting the record and send them promptly to the circuit clerk together with a list of the documents correspondingly numbered and reasonably identified. Unless directed to do so by a party or the circuit clerk, the district clerk will not send to the court of appeals documents of unusual bulk or weight, physical exhibits other than documents, or other parts of the record designated for omission by local rule of the court of appeals. If the exhibits are unusually bulky or heavy, a party must arrange with the clerks in advance for their transportation and receipt.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Retaining the Record Temporarily in the District Court for Use in Preparing the Appeal.</cap-smallcap> The parties may stipulate, or the district court on motion may order, that the district clerk retain the record temporarily for the parties to use in preparing the papers on appeal. In that event the district clerk must certify to the circuit clerk that the record on appeal is complete. Upon receipt of the appellee's brief, or earlier if the court orders or the parties agree, the appellant must request the district clerk to forward the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>[Abrogated.]</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Retaining the Record by Court Order.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The court of appeals may, by order or local rule, provide that a certified copy of the docket entries be forwarded instead of the entire record. But a party may at any time during the appeal request that designated parts of the record be forwarded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The district court may order the record or some part of it retained if the court needs it while the appeal is pending, subject, however, to call by the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If part or all of the record is ordered retained, the district clerk must send to the court of appeals a copy of the order and the docket entries together with the parts of the original record allowed by the district court and copies of any parts of the record designated by the parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Retaining Parts of the Record in the District Court by Stipulation of the Parties.</cap-smallcap> The parties may agree by written stipulation filed in the district court that designated parts of the record be retained in the district court subject to call by the court of appeals or request by a party. The parts of the record so designated remain a part of the record on appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Record for a Preliminary Motion in the Court of Appeals.</cap-smallcap> If, before the record is forwarded, a party makes any of the following motions in the court of appeals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&bull; for dismissal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&bull; for release;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&bull; for a stay pending appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&bull; for additional security on the bond on appeal or on a supersedeas bond; or</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em>. These subdivisions are derived from FRCP 73(g) and FRCP 75(e). FRCP 75(e) presently directs the clerk of the district court to transmit the record within the time allowed or fixed for its filing, which, under the provisions of FRCP 73(g) is within 40 days from the date of filing the notice of appeal, unless an extension is obtained from the district court. The precise time at which the record must be transmitted thus depends upon the time required for delivery of the record from the district court to the court of appeals, since, to permit its timely filing, it must reach the court of appeals before expiration of the 40-day period of an extension thereof. Subdivision (a) of this rule provides that the record is to be transmitted within the 40-day period, or any extension thereof; subdivision (b) provides that transmission is effected when the clerk of the district court mails or otherwise forwards the record to the clerk of the court of appeals; Rule 12(b) directs the clerk of the court of appeals to file the record upon its receipt following timely docketing and transmittal. It can thus be determined with certainty precisely when the clerk of the district court must forward the record to the clerk of the court of appeals in order to effect timely filing: the final day of the 40-day period or of any extension thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This subdivision is derived from FRCP 75(e) without change of substance.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This subdivision is derived from FRCP 73(g) and FRCrP 39(c). Under present rules the district court is empowered to extend the time for filing the record and docketing the appeal. Since under the proposed rule timely transmission now insures timely filing (see note to subdivisions (a) and (b) above) the power of the district court is expressed in terms of its power to extend the time for transmitting the record. Restriction of that power to a period of 90 days after the filing of the notice of appeal represents a change in the rule with respect to appeals in criminal cases. FRCrP 39(c) now permits the district court to extend the time for filing and docketing without restriction. No good reason appears for a difference between the civil and criminal rule in this regard, and subdivision (d) limits the power of the district court to extend the time for transmitting the record in all cases to 90 days from the date of filing the notice of appeal, just as its power is now limited with respect to docketing and fil<!-- PDFPage:26 -->ing in civil cases. Subdivision (d) makes explicit the power of the court of appeals to permit the record to be filed at any time. See <em>Pyramid Motor Freight Corporation v. Ispass</em>, 330, U.S. 695, 67 S.Ct. 954, 91 L.Ed. 1184 (1947).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under present Rule 11(a) it is provided that the record shall be transmitted to the court of appeals within 40 days after the filing of the notice of appeal. Under present Rule 11(d) the district court, on request made during the initial time or any extension thereof, and cause shown, may extend the time for the transmission of the record to a point not more than 90 days after the filing of the first notice of appeal. If the district court is without authority to grant a request to extend the time, or denies a request for extension, the appellant may make a motion for extension of time in the court of appeals. Thus the duty to see that the record is transmitted is placed on the appellant. Aside from ordering the transcript within the time prescribed the appellant has no control over the time at which the record is transmitted, since all steps beyond this point are in the hands of the reporter and the clerk. The proposed amendments recognize this fact and place the duty directly on the reporter and the clerk. After receiving the written order for the transcript (See Note to Rule 10(b) above), the reporter must acknowledge its receipt, indicate when he expects to have it completed, and mail the order so endorsed to the clerk of the court of appeals. Requests for extensions of time must be made by the reporter to the clerk of the court of appeals and action on such requests is entered on the docket. Thus from the point at which the transcript is ordered the clerk of the court of appeals is made aware of any delays. If the transcript is not filed on time, the clerk of the court of appeals will notify the district judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Present Rule 11(b) provides that the record shall be transmitted when it is &ldquo;complete for the purposes of the appeal.&rdquo; The proposed amended rule continues this requirement. The record is complete for the purposes of the appeal when it contains the original papers on file in the clerk's office, all necessary exhibits, and the transcript, if one is to be included. Cf. present Rule 11(c). The original papers will be in the custody of the clerk of the district court at the time the notice of appeal is filed. See Rule 5(e) of the F.R.C.P. The custody of exhibits is often the subject of local rules. Some of them require that documentary exhibits must be deposited with the clerk. See Local Rule 13 of the Eastern District of Virginia. Others leave exhibits with counsel, subject to order of the court. See Local Rule 33 of the Northern District of Illinois. If under local rules the custody of exhibits is left with counsel, the district court should make adequate provision for their preservation during the time during which an appeal may be taken, the prompt deposit with the clerk of such as under Rule 11(b) are to be transmitted to the court of appeals, and the availability of others in the event that the court of appeals should require their transmission. Cf. Local Rule 11 of the Second Circuit.</p>
<p class="note-body">Usually the record will be complete with the filing of the transcript. While the proposed amendment requires transmission &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; when the record is complete, it was not designed to preclude a local requirement by the court of appeals that the original papers and exhibits be transmitted when complete without awaiting the filing of the transcript.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendments continue the provision in the present rule that documents of unusual bulk or weight and physical exhibits other than documents shall not be transmitted without direction by the parties or by the court of appeals, and the requirement that the parties make special arrangements for transmission and receipt of exhibits of unusual bulk or weight. In addition, they give recognition to local rules that make transmission of other record items subject to order of the court of appeals. See Local Rule 4 of the Seventh Circuit.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. All that is involved in the docketing of an appeal is the payment of the docket fee. In practice, after the clerk of the court of appeals receives the record from the clerk of the district court he notifies the appellant of its receipt and requests payment of the fee. Upon receipt of the fee, the clerk enters the appeal upon the docket and files the record. The appellant is allowed to pay the fee at any time within the time allowed or fixed for transmission of the record and thereby to discharge his responsibility for docketing. The final sentence is added in the interest of facilitating future reference and citation and location of cases in indexes. Compare 3d Cir. Rule 10(2); 4th Cir. Rule 9(8); 6th Cir. Rule 14(1).</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Under present Rule 12(a) the appellant must pay the docket fee within the time fixed for the transmission of the record, and upon timely payment of the fee, the appeal is docketed. The proposed amendment takes the docketing out of the hands of the appellant. The fee is paid at the time the notice of appeal is filed and the appeal is entered on the docket upon receipt of a copy of the notice of appeal and of the docket entries, which are sent to the court of appeals under the provisions of Rule 3(d). This is designed to give the <!-- PDFPage:27 -->court of appeals control of its docket at the earliest possible time so that within the limits of its facilities and personnel it can screen cases for appropriately different treatment, expedite the proceedings through prehearing conferences or otherwise, and in general plan more effectively for the prompt disposition of cases.</p>

The requirement added here is that whenever an attorney files a notice of appeal, the attorney must soon thereafter file a statement indicating all parties represented on the appeal by that attorney. Although the notice of appeal is the jurisdictional document and it must clearly indicate who is bringing the appeal, the representation statement will be helpful especially to the court of appeals in identifying the individual appellants.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009</h4>
<p class="note-body">This new rule corresponds to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, which adopts for any motion that the district court cannot grant because of a pending appeal the practice that most courts follow when a party moves under Civil Rule 60(b) to vacate a judgment that is pending on appeal. After an appeal has been docketed and while it remains pending, the district court cannot grant relief under a rule such as Civil Rule 60(b) without a remand. But it can entertain the motion and deny it, defer consideration, state that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose, or state that the motion raises a substantial issue. Experienced lawyers often refer to the suggestion for remand as an &ldquo;indicative ruling.&rdquo; (Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) lists six motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or after the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed of. The district court has authority to grant the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is helpful when relief is sought from an order that the court cannot reconsider because the order is the subject of a pending appeal. In the criminal context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1 will be used primarily if not exclusively for newly discovered evidence motions under Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (<em>see United States v. Cronic</em>, 466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under Criminal Rule 35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3582(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.1 does not attempt to define the circumstances in which an appeal limits or defeats the district court's authority to act in the face of a pending appeal. The rules that govern the relationship between trial courts and appellate courts may be complex, depending in part on the nature of the order and the source of appeal jurisdiction. Appellate Rule 12.1 applies only when those rules deprive the district court of authority to grant relief without appellate permission.</p>
<p class="note-body">To ensure proper coordination of proceedings in the district court and in the court of appeals, the movant must notify the circuit clerk if the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue. The &ldquo;substantial issue&rdquo; standard may be illustrated by the following hypothetical: The district court grants summary judgment dismissing a case. While the plaintiff's appeal is pending, the plaintiff moves for relief from the judgment, claiming newly discovered evidence and also possible fraud by the defendant during the discovery process. If the district court reviews the motion and indicates that the motion &ldquo;raises a substantial issue,&rdquo; the court of appeals may well wish to remand rather than proceed to determine the appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the district court states that it would grant the motion or that the motion raises a substantial issue, the movant may ask the court of appeals to remand so that the district court can make its final ruling on the motion. In accordance with Rule 47(a)(1), a local rule may prescribe the format for the litigants&rsquo; notifications and the district court's statement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Remand is in the court of appeals&rsquo; discretion. The court of appeals may remand all proceedings, terminating the initial appeal. In the context of postjudgment motions, however, that procedure should be followed only when the appellant has stated clearly its intention to abandon the appeal. The danger is that if the initial appeal is terminated and the district court then denies the requested relief, the time for appealing the initial judgment will have run out and a court might rule that the appellant is limited to appealing the denial of the postjudgment motion. The latter appeal may well not provide the appellant with the opportunity to raise all the challenges that could have been raised on appeal from the underlying judgment. <em>See, e.g., Browder v. Dir., Dep't of Corrections of Ill.</em>, 434 U.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978) (&ldquo;[A]n appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.&rdquo;). The Committee does not endorse the notion that a court of appeals should decide that the initial appeal was abandoned&mdash;despite the absence of any clear statement of intent to abandon the appeal&mdash;merely because an un<!-- PDFPage:28 -->limited remand occurred, but the possibility that a court might take that troubling view underscores the need for caution in delimiting the scope of the remand.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court of appeals may instead choose to remand for the sole purpose of ruling on the motion while retaining jurisdiction to proceed with the appeal after the district court rules on the motion (if the appeal is not moot at that point and if any party wishes to proceed). This will often be the preferred course in the light of the concerns expressed above. It is also possible that the court of appeals may wish to proceed to hear the appeal even after the district court has granted relief on remand; thus, even when the district court indicates that it would grant relief, the court of appeals may in appropriate circumstances choose a limited rather than unlimited remand.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court of appeals remands but retains jurisdiction, subdivision (b) requires the parties to notify the circuit clerk when the district court has decided the motion on remand. This is a joint obligation that is discharged when the required notice is given by any litigant involved in the motion in the district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">When relief is sought in the district court during the pendency of an appeal, litigants should bear in mind the likelihood that a new or amended notice of appeal will be necessary in order to challenge the district court's disposition of the motion. <em>See, e.g., Jordan v. Bowen</em>, 808 F.2d 733, 736&ndash;37 (10th Cir. 1987) (viewing district court's response to appellant's motion for indicative ruling as a denial of appellant's request for relief under Rule 60(b), and refusing to review that denial because appellant had failed to take an appeal from the denial); <em>TAAG Linhas Aereas de Angola v. Transamerica Airlines, Inc.</em>, 915 F.2d 1351, 1354 (9th Cir. 1990) (&ldquo;[W]here a 60(b) motion is filed subsequent to the notice of appeal and considered by the district court after a limited remand, an appeal specifically from the ruling on the motion must be taken if the issues raised in that motion are to be considered by the Court of Appeals.&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment.</em> No changes were made to the text of Rule 12.1. The Appellate Rules Committee made two changes to the Note in response to public comments, and made additional changes in consultation with the Civil Rules Committee and in response to some Appellate Rules Committee members&rsquo; suggestions. The Standing Committee made two further changes to the Note.</p>
<p class="note-body">As published for comment, the second paragraph of the Note read: &ldquo;[Appellate Rule 12.1 is not limited to the Civil Rule 62.1 context; Rule 12.1 may also be used, for example, in connection with motions under Criminal Rule 33. <em>See United States v. Cronic</em>, 466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984).] The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is helpful whenever relief is sought from an order that the court cannot reconsider because the order is the subject of a pending appeal.&rdquo; The Appellate Rules Committee discussed the Solicitor General's concern that Appellate Rule 12.1 might be misused in the criminal context. In response, the Appellate Rules Committee deleted the second paragraph as published and substituted the following language: &ldquo;The procedure formalized by Rule 12.1 is helpful when relief is sought from an order that the court cannot reconsider because the order is the subject of a pending appeal. In the criminal context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1's use will be limited to newly discovered evidence motions under Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (<em>see United States v. Cronic</em>, 466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under Criminal Rule 35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3582(c).&rdquo; The Standing Committee further revised the latter sentence to read: &ldquo;In the criminal context, the Committee anticipates that Rule 12.1 will be used primarily if not exclusively for newly discovered evidence motions under Criminal Rule 33(b)(1) (<em>see United States v. Cronic</em>, 466 U.S. 648, 667 n.42 (1984)), reduced sentence motions under Criminal Rule 35(b), and motions under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3582(c).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">As published for comment, the first sentence of the Note's last paragraph read: &ldquo;When relief is sought in the district court during the pendency of an appeal, litigants should bear in mind the likelihood that a separate notice of appeal will be necessary in order to challenge the district court's disposition of the motion.&rdquo; In response to a suggestion by Public Citizen, the Appellate Rules Committee revised this sentence to refer to a &ldquo;new or amended&rdquo; notice of appeal rather than a &ldquo;separate&rdquo; notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Appellate Rules Committee, in consultation with the Civil Rules Committee, added the following parenthetical at the end of the Note's first paragraph: &ldquo;(The effect of a notice of appeal on district-court authority is addressed by Appellate Rule 4(a)(4), which lists six motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or after the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed of. The district court has authority to grant the motion without resorting to the indicative ruling procedure.)&rdquo; This parenthetical is designed to forestall confusion concerning the effect of tolling motions on a district court's power to act. The Standing Committee approved a change to the first sentence of the parenthetical; it now reads: &ldquo;Appellate Rule 4(a)(4) lists six motions that, if filed within the relevant time limit, suspend the effect of a notice of appeal filed before or after the motion is filed until the last such motion is disposed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Appellate Rules Committee, acting at the suggestion of the Civil Rules Committee, altered the wording of one sentence in the first paragraph and one sentence in the fifth paragraph of the Note. The changes are designed to remove references to remands of &ldquo;the action,&rdquo; since those references would be in tension with the Note's advice concerning the advisability of limited remands. Thus, in the Note's first paragraph &ldquo;if the action is remanded&rdquo; became &ldquo;if the court of appeals remands for that purpose,&rdquo; and in the Note's fifth paragraph &ldquo;may ask the court of appeals to remand the action&rdquo; became &ldquo;may ask the court of appeals to remand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Appellate Rules Committee also made stylistic changes to the Note's first and third paragraphs. &ldquo;Experienced appeal lawyers&rdquo; became &ldquo;Experienced lawyers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;act in face of a pending appeal&rdquo; became &ldquo;act in the face of a pending appeal.&rdquo;</p>
