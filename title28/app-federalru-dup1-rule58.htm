<h3 class="section-head">Rule 58. Entry of Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of Rule 54(b): (1) upon a general verdict of a jury, or upon a decision by the court that a party shall recover only a sum certain or costs or that all relief shall be denied, the clerk, unless the court otherwise orders, shall forthwith prepare, sign, and enter the judgment without awaiting any direction by the court; (2) upon a decision by the court granting other relief, or upon a special verdict or a general verdict accompanied by answers to interrogatories, the court shall promptly approve the form of the judgment, and the clerk shall thereupon enter it. Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document. A judgment is effective only when so set forth and when entered as provided in Rule 79(a). Entry of the judgment shall not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees, except that, when a timely motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2), the court, before a notice of appeal has been filed and has become effective, may order that the motion have the same effect under Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure as a timely motion under Rule 59. Attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment except upon direction of the court, and these directions shall not be given as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="note-body">See Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;270.31 (judgment entered forthwith on verdict of jury unless otherwise ordered), &sect;270.65 (where trial is by the court, entered by direction of the court), &sect;270.63 (entered by clerk on judgment on admitted claim for money). Compare 1 Idaho Code Ann. (1932) &sect;7&ndash;1101, and 4 Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. (1935) &sect;9403, which provides that judgment in jury cases be entered by clerk within 24 hours after verdict unless court otherwise directs. Conn. Practice Book (1934) &sect;200, provides that all judgments shall be entered within one week after rendition. In some States such as Washington, 2 Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;431, in jury cases the judgment is entered two days after the return of verdict to give time for making motion for new trial; &sect;435 (<em>ibid</em>.), provides that all judgments shall be entered by the clerk, subject to the court's direction.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The reference to Rule 54(b) is made necessary by the amendment of that rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two changes have been made in Rule 58 in order to clarify the practice. The substitution of the more in<!-- PDFPage:198 -->clusive phrase &ldquo;all relief be denied&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;there be no recovery&rdquo;, makes it clear that the clerk shall enter the judgment forthwith in the situations specified without awaiting the filing of a formal judgment approved by the court. The phrase &ldquo;all relief be denied&rdquo; covers cases such as the denial of a bankrupt's discharge and similar situations where the relief sought is refused but there is literally no denial of a &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The addition of the last sentence in the rule emphasizes that judgments are to be entered promptly by the clerk without waiting for the taxing of costs. Certain district court rules, for example, Civil Rule 22 of the Southern District of New York&mdash;until its annulment Oct. 1, 1945, for conflict with this rule&mdash;and the like rule of the Eastern District of New York, are expressly in conflict with this provision, although the federal law is of long standing and well settled. <em>Fowler v. Hamill</em> (1891) 139 U.S. 549; <em>Craig v. The Hartford</em> (C.C.Cal. 1856) Fed.Case No. 3,333; <em>Tuttle v. Claflin</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1895) 60 Fed. 7, cert. den. (1897) 166 U.S. 721; <em>Prescott & A. C. Ry. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1897) 84 Fed. 213; <em>Stallo v. Wagner</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1917) 245 Fed. 636, 639&ndash;40; <em>Brown v. Parker</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1899) 97 Fed. 446; <em>Allis-Chalmers v. United States</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1908) 162 Fed. 679. And this applies even though state law is to the contrary. <em>United States v. Nordbye</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1935) 75 F.(2d) 744, 746, cert. den. (1935) 296 U.S. 572. Inasmuch as it has been held that failure of the clerk thus enter judgment is a &ldquo;misprision&rdquo; &ldquo;not to be excused&rdquo; <em>(The Washington</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1926) 16 F.(2d) 206), such a district court rule may have serious consequences for a district court clerk. Rules of this sort also provide for delay in entry of the judgment contrary to Rule 58. See <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bedford's Estate</em> (1945) 325 U.S. 283.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the present rule a distinction has sometimes been made between judgments on general jury verdicts, on the one hand, and, on the other, judgments upon decisions of the court that a party shall recover only money or costs or that all relief shall be denied. In the first situation, it is clear that the clerk should enter the judgment without awaiting a direction by the court unless the court otherwise orders. In the second situation it was intended that the clerk should similarly enter the judgment forthwith upon the court's decision; but because of the separate listing in the rule, and the use of the phrase &ldquo;upon receipt . . . of the direction,&rdquo; the rule has sometimes been interpreted as requiring the clerk to await a separate direction of the court. All these judgments are usually uncomplicated, and should be handled in the same way. The amended rule accordingly deals with them as a single group in clause (1) (substituting the expression &ldquo;only a sum certain&rdquo; for the present expression &ldquo;only money&rdquo;), and requires the clerk to prepare, sign, and enter them forthwith, without awaiting court direction, unless the court makes a contrary order. (The clerk's duty is ministerial and may be performed by a deputy clerk in the name of the clerk. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;956; <em>cf. Gilbertson v. United States</em>, 168 Fed. 672 (7th Cir. 1909).) The more complicated judgments described in clause (2) must be approved by the court before they are entered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 58 is designed to encourage all reasonable speed in formulating and entering the judgment when the case has been decided. Participation by the attorneys through the submission of forms of judgment involves needless expenditure of time and effort and promotes delay, except in special cases where counsel's assistance can be of real value. See <em>Matteson v. United States</em>, 240 F.2d 517, 518&ndash;19 (2d Cir. 1956). Accordingly, the amended rule provides that attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment unless directed to do so by the court. This applies to the judgments mentioned in clause (2) as well as clause (1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Hitherto some difficulty has arisen, chiefly where the court has written an opinion or memorandum containing some apparently directive or dispositive words, e.g., &ldquo;the plaintiff's motion [for summary judgment] is granted,&rdquo; see <em>United States v. F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co</em>., 356 U.S. 227, 229, 78 S.Ct. 674, 2 L.Ed.2d 721 (1958). Clerks on occasion have viewed these opinions or memoranda as being in themselves a sufficient basis for entering judgment in the civil docket as provided by Rule 79(a). However, where the opinion or memorandum has not contained all the elements of a judgment, or where the judge has later signed a formal judgment, it has become a matter of doubt whether the purported entry of judgment was effective, starting the time running for postverdict motions and for the purpose of appeal. See <em>id.;</em> and <em>compare Blanchard v. Commonwealth Oil Co</em>., 294 F.2d 834 (5th Cir. 1961); <em>United States v. Higginson</em>, 238 F.2d 439 (1st Cir. 1956); <em>Danzig v. Virgin Isle Hotel, Inc</em>., 278 F.2d 580 (3d Cir. 1960); <em>Sears v. Austin</em>, 282 F.2d 340 (9th Cir. 1960), with <em>Matteson v. United States, supra; Erstling v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co</em>., 255 F.2d 93 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Barta v. Oglala Sioux Tribe</em>, 259 F.2d 553 (8th Cir. 1958), <em>cert. denied</em>, 358 U.S. 932, 79 S.Ct. 320, 3 L.Ed.2d 304 (1959); <em>Beacon Fed. S. & L. Assn. v. Federal Home L. Bank Bd</em>., 266 F.2d 246 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 823, 80 S.Ct. 70, 4 L.Ed.2d 67 (1959); <em>Ram v. Paramount Film D. Corp</em>., 278 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule eliminates these uncertainties by requiring that there be a judgment set out on a separate document&mdash;distinct from any opinion or memorandum&mdash;which provides the basis for the entry of judgment. That judgments shall be on separate documents is also indicated in Rule 79(b); and see General Rule 10 of the U.S. District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York; <em>Ram v. Paramount Film D. Corp., supra</em>, at 194.</p>
<p class="note-body">See the amendment of Rule 79(a) and the new specimen forms of judgment, Forms 31 and 32.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also Rule 55(b)(1) and (2) covering the subject of judgments by default.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ordinarily the pendency or post-judgment filing of a claim for attorney's fees will not affect the time for appeal from the underlying judgment. <em>See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co</em>., 486 U.S. 196 (1988). Particularly if the claim for fees involves substantial issues or is likely to be affected by the appellate decision, the district court may prefer to defer consideration of the claim for fees until after the appeal is resolved. However, in many cases it may be more efficient to decide fee questions before an appeal is taken so that appeals relating to the fee award can be heard at the same time as appeals relating to the merits of the case. This revision permits, but does not require, the court to delay the finality of the judgment for appellate purposes under revised Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) until the fee dispute is decided. To accomplish this result requires entry of an order by the district court before the time a notice of appeal becomes effective for appellate purposes. If the order is entered, the motion for attorney's fees is treated in the same manner as a timely motion under Rule 59.</p>
