<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) was added to give statutory sanction to orderly and appropriate procedure. A circuit judge who unnecessarily entertains applications which should be addressed to the district court, thereby disqualifies himself to hear such matters on appeal and to that extent limits his usefulness as a judge of the court of appeals. The Supreme Court and Supreme Court Justices should not be burdened with applications for writs cognizable in the district courts.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A motion in the court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive application shall be determined by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The court of appeals shall grant or deny the authorization to file a second or successive application not later than 30 days after the filing of the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A district court shall dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In a habeas corpus proceeding brought in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a prior judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States on an appeal or review by a writ of certiorari at the instance of the prisoner of the decision of such State court, shall be conclusive as to all issues of fact or law with respect to an asserted denial of a Federal right which constitutes ground for discharge in a habeas corpus proceeding, actually adjudicated by the Supreme Court therein, <!-- PDFPage:459 -->unless the applicant for the writ of habeas corpus shall plead and the court shall find the existence of a material and controlling fact which did not appear in the record of the proceeding in the Supreme Court and the court shall further find that the applicant for the writ of habeas corpus could not have caused such fact to appear in such record by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section makes no material change in existing practice. Notwithstanding the opportunity open to litigants to abuse the writ, the courts have consistently refused to entertain successive &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; applications for habeas corpus. It is derived from H.R. 4232 introduced in the first session of the Seventy-ninth Congress by Chairman Hatton Sumners of the Committee on the Judiciary and referred to that Committee.</p>
<p class="note-body">The practice of suing out successive, repetitious, and unfounded writs of habeas corpus imposes an unnecessary burden on the courts. See <em>Dorsey v. Gill</em>, 1945, 148 F.2d 857, 862, in which Miller, J., notes that &ldquo;petitions for the writ are used not only as they should be to protect unfortunate persons against miscarriages of justice, but also as a device for harassing court, custodial, and enforcement officers with a multiplicity of repetitious, meritless requests for relief. The most extreme example is that of a person who, between July 1, 1939, and April 1944 presented in the District Court 50 petitions for writs of habeas corpus; another person has presented 27 petitions; a third, 24; a fourth, 22; a fifth, 20. One hundred nineteen persons have presented 597 petitions&mdash;an average of 5.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State shall not be deemed to have waived the exhaustion requirement or be estopped from reliance upon the requirement unless the State, through counsel, expressly waives the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, within the meaning of this section, if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) If the applicant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in such State court proceeding to support the State court's determination of a factual issue made therein, the applicant, if able, shall produce that part of the record pertinent to a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support such determination. If the applicant, because of indigency or other reason is unable to produce such part of the record, then the State shall produce such part of the record and the Federal court shall di<!-- PDFPage:462 -->rect the State to do so by order directed to an appropriate State official.

<p class="statutory-body">(h) Except as provided in section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act, in all proceedings brought under this section, and any subsequent proceedings on review, the court may appoint counsel for an applicant who is or becomes financially unable to afford counsel, except as provided by a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Appointment of counsel under this section shall be governed by section 3006A of title 18.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Senate Revision Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Senate amendment to this section, Senate Report No. 1559, amendment No. 47, has three declared purposes, set forth as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The first is to eliminate from the prohibition of the section applications in behalf of prisoners in custody under authority of a State officer but whose custody has not been directed by the judgment of a State court. If the section were applied to applications by persons detained solely under authority of a State officer it would unduly hamper Federal courts in the protection of Federal officers prosecuted for acts committed in the course of official duty.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The second purpose is to eliminate, as a ground of Federal jurisdiction to review by habeas corpus judgments of State courts, the proposition that the State court has denied a prisoner a &lsquo;fair adjudication of the legality of his detention under the Constitution and laws of the United States.&rsquo; The Judicial Conference believes that this would be an undesirable ground for Federal jurisdiction in addition to exhaustion of State remedies or lack of adequate remedy in the State courts because it would permit proceedings in the Federal court on this ground before the petitioner had exhausted his State remedies. This ground would, of course, always be open to a petitioner to assert in the Federal court after he had exhausted his State remedies or if he had no adequate State remedy.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The third purpose is to substitute detailed and specific language for the phrase &lsquo;no adequate remedy available.&rsquo; That phrase is not sufficiently specific and precise, and its meaning should, therefore, be spelled out in more detail in the section as is done by the amendment.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 1 provides that the habeas corpus rules are applicable to petitions by persons in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court. See <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez</em>, 411 U.S. 475, 484 (1973). Whether the rules ought to apply to other situations (<em>e.g</em>., person in active military service, <em>Glazier v. Hackel</em>, 440 F.2d 592 (9th Cir. 1971); or a reservist called to active duty but not reported, <em>Hammond v. Lenfest</em>, 398 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1968)) is left to the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">The basic scope of habeas corpus is prescribed by statute. 28 U.S.C. &sect;2241(c) provides that the &ldquo;writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;(h)e is <em>in custody</em> in violation of the Constitution.&rdquo; 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254 deals specifically with state custody, providing that habeas corpus shall apply only &ldquo;in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, supra</em>, the court said: &ldquo;It is clear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody, and that the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody.&rdquo; 411 U.S. at 484.</p>
<p class="note-body">Initially the Supreme Court held that habeas corpus was appropriate only in those situations in which petitioner's claim would, if upheld, result in an immediate release from a present custody. <em>McNally v. Hill</em>, 293 U.S. 131 (1934). This was changed in <em>Peyton v. Rowe</em>, 391 U.S. 54 (1968), in which the court held that habeas corpus was a proper way to attack a consecutive sentence to be served in the future, expressing the view that consecutive sentences resulted in present custody under both judgments, not merely the one imposing the first sentence. This view was expanded in <em>Carafas v. LaVallee</em>, 391 U.S. 234 (1968), to recognize the propriety of habeas corpus in a case in which petitioner was in custody when the petition had been originally filed but had since been unconditionally released from custody.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez</em>, 411 U.S. at 486 et seq.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since <em>Carafas</em>, custody has been construed more liberally by the courts so as to make a &sect;2255 motion or habeas corpus petition proper in more situations. &ldquo;In custody&rdquo; now includes a person who is: on parole, <em>Jones v. Cunningham</em>, 371 U.S. 236 (1963); at large on his own recognizance but subject to several conditions pending execution of his sentence, <em>Hensley v. Municipal Court</em>, 411 U.S. 345 (1973); or released on bail after conviction pending final disposition of his case, <em>Lefkowitz v. Newsome</em>, 95 S.Ct. 886 (1975). See also <em>United States v. Re</em>, 372 F.2d 641 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 912 (1967) (on probation); <em>Walker v. North Carolina</em>, 262 F.Supp. 102 (W.D.N.C. 1966), aff'd per curiam, 372 F.2d 129 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 917 (1967) (recipient of a conditionally suspended sentence); <em>Burris v. Ryan</em>, 397 F.2d 553 (7th Cir. 1968); <em>Marden v. Purdy</em>, 409 F.2d 784 (5th Cir. 1969) (free on bail); <em>United States ex rel. Smith v. Dibella</em>, 314 F.Supp. 446 (D.Conn. 1970) (release on own recognizance); <em>Choung v. California</em>, 320 F.Supp. 625 (E.D.Cal. 1970) (federal stay of state court sentence); <em>United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York</em>, 426 F.2d 1176 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 941 (1971) (subject to parole detainer warrant); <em>Capler v. City of Greenville</em>, 422 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 1970) (released on appeal bond); <em>Glover v. North Carolina</em>, 301 F.Supp. 364 (E.D.N.C. 1969) (sentence served, but as convicted felon disqualified from engaging in several activities).</p>
<p class="note-body">The courts are not unanimous in dealing with the above situations, and the boundaries of custody remain somewhat unclear. In <em>Morgan v. Thomas</em>, 321 F.Supp. 565 (S.D.Miss. 1970), the court noted:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">It is axiomatic that actual physical custody or restraint is not required to confer habeas jurisdiction. Rather, the term is synonymous with restraint of liberty. The real question is how much restraint of one's liberty is necessary before the right to apply for the writ comes into play. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">It is clear however, that something more than moral restraint is necessary to make a case for habeas corpus.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">321 F.Supp. at 573</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Hammond v. Lenfest</em>, 398 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1968), reviewed prior &ldquo;custody&rdquo; doctrine and reaffirmed a generalized flexible approach to the issue. In speaking about 28 U.S.C. &sect;2241, the first section in the habeas corpus statutes, the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">While the language of the Act indicates that a writ of habeas corpus is appropriate only when a petitioner is &ldquo;in custody,&rdquo; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the Act &ldquo;does not attempt to mark the boundaries of &lsquo;custody&rsquo; nor in any way other than by use of that word attempt to limit the situations in which the writ can be used.&rdquo; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* And, recent Supreme Court decisions have made clear that &ldquo;[i]t [habeas corpus] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose&mdash;the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.&rdquo; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* &ldquo;[B]esides physical imprisonment, there are other restraints on a man's liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally, which have been thought sufficient in the English-speaking world to support the issuance of habeas corpus.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">398 F.2d at 710&ndash;711</h4>
<p class="note-body">There is, as of now, no final list of the situations which are appropriate for habeas corpus relief. It is not the intent of these rules or notes to define or limit &ldquo;custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It is, however, the view of the Advisory Committee that claims of improper conditions of custody or confinement (not related to the propriety of the custody itself), can better be handled by other means such as 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983 and other related statutes. In <em>Wilwording v. Swanson</em>, 404 U.S. 249 (1971), the court treated a habeas corpus petition by a state prisoner challenging the conditions of confinement as a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983, the Civil Rights Act. Compare <em>Johnson v. Avery</em>, 393 U.S. 483 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">The distinction between duration of confinement and conditions of confinement may be difficult to draw. Compare <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez</em>, 411 U.S. 475 (1973), with <em>Clutchette v. Procunier</em>, 497 F.2d 809 (9th Cir. 1974), modified, 510 F.2d 613 (1975).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 1 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are in<!-- PDFPage:464 -->tended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. In response to at least one commentator on the published rules, the Committee modified Rule 1(b) to reflect the point that if the court was considering a habeas petition not covered by &sect;2254, the court could apply some or all of the rules.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 2. The Petition</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Current Custody; Naming the Respondent</cap-smallcap>. If the petitioner is currently in custody under a state-court judgment, the petition must name as respondent the state officer who has custody.</p>

If the petitioner is not yet in custody&mdash;but may be subject to future custody&mdash;under the state-court judgment being contested, the petition must name as respondents both the officer who has current custody and the attorney general of the state where the judgment was entered. The petition must ask for relief from the state-court judgment being contested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Form</cap-smallcap>. The petition must:</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 2 describes the requirements of the actual petition, including matters relating to its form, contents, scope, and sufficiency. The rule provides more specific guidance for a petitioner and the court than 28 U.S.C. &sect;2242, after which it is patterned.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) provides that an applicant challenging a state judgment, pursuant to which he is presently in custody, must make his application in the form of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. It also requires that the state officer having custody of the applicant be named as respondent. This is consistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;2242, which says in part, &ldquo;[Application for a writ of habeas corpus] shall allege *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the name of the person who has custody over [the applicant] *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; The proper person to be served in the usual case is either the warden of the institution in which the petitioner is incarcerated (<em>Sanders v. Bennett</em>, 148 F.2d 19 (D.C.Cir. 1945)) or the chief officer in charge of state penal institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) prescribes the procedure to be used for a petition challenging a judgment under which the petitioner will be subject to custody in the future. In this event the relief sought will usually not be released from present custody, but rather for a declaration that the judgment being attacked is invalid. Subdivision (b) thus provides for a prayer for &ldquo;appropriate relief.&rdquo; It is also provided that the attorney general of the state of the judgment as well as the state officer having actual custody of the petitioner shall be named as respondents. This is appropriate because no one will have custody of the petitioner in the state of the judgment being attacked, and the habeas corpus action will usually be defended by the attorney general. The attorney general is in the best position to inform the court as to who the proper party respondent is. If it is not the attorney general, he can move for a substitution of party.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the concept of &ldquo;custody&rdquo; requisite to the consideration of a petition for habeas corpus has been enlarged significantly in recent years, it may be worthwhile to spell out the various situations which might arise and who should be named as respondent(s) for each situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The applicant is in jail, prison, or other actual physical restraint due to the state action he is attacking. The named respondent shall be the state officer who has official custody of the petitioner (for example, the warden of the prison).</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The applicant is on probation or parole due to the state judgment he is attacking. The named respondents shall be the particular probation or parole officer responsible for supervising the applicant, and the official in charge of the parole or probation agency, or the state correctional agency, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The applicant is in custody in any other manner differing from (1) and (2) above due to the effects of the state action he seeks relief from. The named respondent should be the attorney general of the state wherein such action was taken.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The applicant is in jail, prison, or other actual physical restraint but is attacking a state action which will cause him to be kept in custody in the future rather than the government action under which he is presently confined. The named respondents shall be the state or federal officer who has official custody of him at the time the petition is filed and the attorney general of the state whose action subjects the petitioner to future custody.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) The applicant is in custody, although not physically restrained, and is attacking a state action which will result in his future custody rather than the government action out of which his present custody arises. The named respondent(s) shall be the attorney general of the state whose action subjects the petitioner to future custody, as well as the government officer who has present official custody of the petitioner if there is such an officer and his identity is ascertainable.</p>
<p class="note-body">In any of the above situations the judge may require or allow the petitioner to join an additional or different party as a respondent if to do so would serve the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">As seen in rule 1 and paragraphs (4) and (5) above, these rules contemplate that a petitioner currently in federal custody will be permitted to apply for habeas relief from a state restraint which is to go into effect in the future. There has been disagreement in the courts as to whether they have jurisdiction of the habeas application under these circumstances (compare <em>Piper v. United States</em>, 306 F.Supp. 1259 (D.Conn. 1969), with <em>United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York</em>, 426 F.2d 1176 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 941 (1971)). This rule seeks to make clear that they do have such jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that unless a district court requires otherwise by local rule, the petition must be in the form annexed to these rules. Having a standard prescribed form has several advantages. In the past, petitions have frequently contained mere conclusions of law, unsupported by any facts. Since it is the relationship of the facts to the claim asserted that is important, these petitions were obviously deficient. In addition, lengthy and often illegible petitions, arranged in no logical order, were submitted to judges who have had to spend hours deciphering them. For example, in <!-- PDFPage:465 --><em>Passic v. Michigan</em>, 98 F.Supp. 1015, 1016 (E.D.Mich. 1951), the court dismissed a petition for habeas corpus, describing it as &ldquo;two thousand pages of irrational, prolix and redundant pleadings *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Administrative convenience, of benefit to both the court and the petitioner, results from the use of a prescribed form. Judge Hubert L. Will briefly described the experience with the use of a standard form in the Northern District of Illinois:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Our own experience, though somewhat limited, has been quite satisfactory. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">In addition, [petitions] almost always contain the necessary basic information *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. Very rarely do we get the kind of hybrid federal-state habeas corpus petition with civil rights allegations thrown in which were not uncommon in the past. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [W]hen a real constitutional issue is raised it is quickly apparent *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">33 F.R.D. 363, 384</h4>
<p class="note-body">Approximately 65 to 70% of all districts have adopted forms or local rules which require answers to essentially the same questions as contained in the standard form annexed to these rules. All courts using forms have indicated the petitions are time-saving and more legible. The form is particularly helpful in getting information about whether there has been an exhaustion of state remedies or, at least, where that information can be obtained.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement of a standard form benefits the petitioner as well. His assertions are more readily apparent, and a meritorious claim is more likely to be properly raised and supported. The inclusion in the form of the ten most frequently raised grounds in habeas corpus petitions is intended to encourage the applicant to raise all his asserted grounds in one petition. It may better enable him to recognize if an issue he seeks to raise is cognizable under habeas corpus and hopefully inform him of those issues as to which he must first exhaust his state remedies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some commentators have suggested that the use of forms is of little help because the questions usually are too general, amounting to little more than a restatement of the statute. They contend the blanks permit a prisoner to fill in the same ambiguous answers he would have offered without the aid of a form. See Comment, Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1177&ndash;1178 (1970). Certainly, as long as the statute requires factual pleading, the adequacy of a petition will continue to be affected largely by the petitioner's intelligence and the legal advice available to him. On balance, however, the use of forms has contributed enough to warrant mandating their use.</p>
<p class="note-body">Giving the petitioner a list of often-raised grounds may, it is said, encourage perjury. See Comment, Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1178 (1970). Most inmates are aware of, or have access to, some common constitutional grounds for relief. Thus, the risk of perjury is not likely to be substantially increased and the benefit of the list for some inmates seems sufficient to outweigh any slight risk that perjury will increase. There is a penalty for perjury, and this would seem the most appropriate way to try to discourage it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Legal assistance is increasingly available to inmates either through paraprofessional programs involving law students or special programs staffed by members of the bar. See Jacob and Sharma, Justice After Trial: Prisoners&rsquo; Need for Legal Services in the Criminal-Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev. 493 (1970). In these situations, the prescribed form can be filled out more competently, and it does serve to ensure a degree of uniformity in the manner in which habeas corpus claims are presented.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) directs the clerk of the district court to make available to applicants upon request, without charge, blank petitions in the prescribed form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) also requires that all available grounds for relief be presented in the petition, including those grounds of which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, the petitioner should be aware. This is reinforced by rule 9(b), which allows dismissal of a second petition which fails to allege new grounds or, if new grounds are alleged, the judge finds an inexcusable failure to assert the ground in the prior petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both subdivision (c) and the annexed form require a legibly handwritten or typewritten petition. As required by 28 U.S.C. &sect;2242, the petition must be signed and sworn to by the petitioner (or someone acting in his behalf).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) provides that a single petition may assert a claim only against the judgment or judgments of a single state court (<em>i.e</em>., a court of the same county or judicial district or circuit). This permits, but does not require, an attack in a single petition on judgments based upon separate indictments or on separate counts even though sentences were imposed on separate days by the same court. A claim against a judgment of a court of a different political subdivision must be raised by means of a separate petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) allows the clerk to return an insufficient petition to the petitioner, and it must be returned if the clerk is so directed by a judge of the court. Any failure to comply with the requirements of rule 2 or 3 is grounds for insufficiency. In situations where there may be arguable noncompliance with another rule, such as rule 9, the judge, not the clerk, must make the decision. If the petition is returned it must be accompanied by a statement of the reason for its return. No petitioner should be left to speculate as to why or in what manner his petition failed to conform to these rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) also provides that the clerk shall retain one copy of the insufficient petition. If the prisoner files another petition, the clerk will be in a better position to determine the sufficiency of the new petition. If the new petition is insufficient, comparison with the prior petition may indicate whether the prisoner has failed to understand the clerk's prior explanation for its insufficiency, so that the clerk can make another, hopefully successful, attempt at transmitting this information to the petitioner. If the petitioner insists that the original petition was in compliance with the rules, a copy of the original petition is available for the consideration of the judge. It is probably better practice to make a photocopy of a petition which can be corrected by the petitioner, thus saving the petitioner the task of completing an additional copy.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c). The amendment takes into account 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746, enacted after adoption of the &sect;2254 rules. Section 1746 provides that in lieu of an affidavit an unsworn statement may be given under penalty of perjury in substantially the following form if executed within the United States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: &ldquo;I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 2(c)(5) has been amended by removing the requirement that the petition be signed personally by the petitioner. As reflected in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2242, an application for habeas corpus relief may be filed by the person who is seeking relief, or by someone acting on behalf of that person. <em>See, e.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas</em>, 495 <!-- PDFPage:466 -->U.S. 149 (1990) (discussion of requisites for &ldquo;next friend&rdquo; standing in petition for habeas corpus). Thus, under the, [sic] amended rule the petition may be signed by petitioner personally or by someone acting on behalf of the petitioner, assuming that the person is authorized to do so, for example, an attorney for the petitioner. The Committee envisions that the courts will apply third-party, or &ldquo;next-friend,&rdquo; standing analysis in deciding whether the signer was actually authorized to sign the petition on behalf of the petitioner.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language in new Rule 2(d) has been changed to reflect that a petitioner must substantially follow the standard form, which is appended to the rules, or a form provided by the court. The current rule, Rule 2(c), seems to indicate a preference for the standard &ldquo;national&rdquo; form. Under the amended rule, there is no stated preference. The Committee understood that current practice in some courts is that if the petitioner first files a petition using the national form, the courts may then ask the petitioner to supplement it with the local form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Current Rule 2(e), which provided for returning an insufficient petition, has been deleted. The Committee believed that the approach in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e) was more appropriate for dealing with petitions that do not conform to the form requirements of the rule. That Rule provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the petitioner suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the petition was deemed insufficient. Now that a one-year statute of limitations applies to petitions filed under &sect;2254, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2244(d)(1), the court's dismissal of a petition because it is not in proper form may pose a significant penalty for a petitioner, who may not be able to file another petition within the one-year limitations period. Now, under revised Rule 3(b), the clerk is required to file a petition, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with the provisions in revised Rule 2(c). The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective petition and require the petitioner to submit a corrected petition that conforms to Rule 2(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. The Committee changed Rule 2(c)(2) to read &ldquo;state the facts&rdquo; rather then [sic] &ldquo;briefly summarize the facts.&rdquo; As one commentator noted, the current language may actually mislead the petitioner and is also redundant. The Committee modified Rule 2(c)(5) to emphasize that any person, other than the petitioner, who signs the petition must be authorized to do so; the revised rule now specifically cites &sect;2242. The Note was changed to reflect that point.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 2(c)(4) was modified to account for those cases where the petitioner prints the petition on a computer word-processing program.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 3 sets out the procedures to be followed by the petitioner and the court in filing the petition. Some of its provisions are currently dealt with by local rule or practice, while others are innovations. Subdivision (a) specifies the petitioner's responsibilities. It requires that the petition, which must be accompanied by two conformed copies thereof, be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court. The petition must be accompanied by the filing fee prescribed by law (presently $5; see 28 U.S.C. &sect;1914(a)), unless leave to prosecute the petition in forma pauperis is applied for and granted. In the event the petitioner desires to prosecute the petition in forma pauperis, he must file the affidavit required by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1915, together with a certificate showing the amount of funds in his institutional account.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring that the petition be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court provides an efficient and uniform system of filing habeas corpus petitions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) requires the clerk to file the petition. If the filing fee accompanies the petition, it may be filed immediately, and, if not, it is contemplated that prompt attention will be given to the request to proceed in forma pauperis. The court may delegate the issuance of the order to the clerk in those cases in which it is clear from the petition that there is full compliance with the requirements to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring the copies of the petition to be filed with the clerk will have an impact not only upon administrative matters, but upon more basic problems as well. In districts with more than one judge, a petitioner under present circumstances may send a petition to more than one judge. If no central filing system exists for each district, two judges may independently take different action on the same petition. Even if the action taken is consistent, there may be needless duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement of an additional two copies of the form of the petition is a current practice in many courts. An efficient filing system requires one copy for use by the court (central file), one for the respondent (under 3(b), the respondent receives a copy of the petition whether an answer is required or not), and one for petitioner's counsel, if appointed. Since rule 2 provides that blank copies of the petition in the prescribed form are to be furnished to the applicant free of charge, there should be no undue burden created by this requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Attached to copies of the petition supplied in accordance with rule 2 is an affidavit form for the use of petitioners desiring to proceed in forma pauperis. The form requires information concerning the petitioner's financial resources.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:467 --><p class="note-body">In forma pauperis cases, the petition must also be accompanied by a certificate indicating the amount of funds in the petitioner's institution account. Usually the certificate will be from the warden. If the petitioner is on probation or parole, the court might want to require a certificate from the supervising officer. Petitions by persons on probation or parole are not numerous enough, however, to justify making special provision for this situation in the text of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The certificate will verify the amount of funds credited to the petitioner in an institution account. The district court may by local rule require that any amount credited to the petitioner, in excess of a stated maximum, must be used for the payment of the filing fee. Since prosecuting an action in forma pauperis is a privilege (see <em>Smart v. Heinze</em>, 347 F.2d 114, 116 (9th Cir. 1965)), it is not to be granted when the petitioner has sufficient resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) details the clerk's duties with regard to filing the petition. If the petition does not appear on its face to comply with the requirements of rules 2 and 3, it may be returned in accordance with rule 2(e). If it appears to comply, it must be filed and entered on the docket in the clerk's office. However, under this subdivision the respondent is not required to answer or otherwise move with respect to the petition unless so ordered by the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 3 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended except as described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of current Rule 3(b), dealing with an answer being filed by the respondent, has been moved to revised Rule 5(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 3(b) is new and is intended to parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e), which provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the petitioner suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the petition was deemed insufficient. That Act, however, added a one-year statute of limitations to petitions filed under &sect;2254, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2244(d)(1). Thus, a court's dismissal of a defective petition may pose a significant penalty for a petitioner who may not be able to file a corrected petition within the one-year limitations period. The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective petition and require the petitioner to submit a corrected petition that conforms to Rule 2. Thus, revised Rule 3(b) requires the clerk to file a petition, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with Rule 2. The rule, however, is not limited to those instances where the petition is defective only in form; the clerk would also be required, for example, to file the petition even though it lacked the requisite filing fee or an <em>in forma pauperis</em> form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 3(c), which sets out a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2244(d), is new and has been added to put petitioners on notice that a one-year statute of limitations applies to petitions filed under these Rules. Although the rule does not address the issue, every circuit that has addressed the issue has taken the position that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is available in appropriate circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. McGinnis</em>, 208 F.3d 13, 17&ndash;18 (2d Cir. 2000); <em>Miller v. New Jersey State Department of Corrections</em>, 145 F.3d 616, 618&ndash;19 (3d Cir. 1998); <em>Harris v. Hutchinson</em>, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000). The Supreme Court has not addressed the question directly. <em>See Duncan v. Walker</em>, 533 U.S. 167, 181 (2001) (&ldquo;We .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have no occasion to address the question that Justice Stevens raises concerning the availability of equitable tolling.&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 3(d) is new and provides guidance on determining whether a petition from an inmate is considered to have been filed in a timely fashion. The new provision parallels Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. The Committee Note was changed to reflect that the clerk must file a petition, even in those instances where the necessary filing fee or in forma pauperis form is not attached. The Note also includes new language concerning the equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 4. Preliminary Review; Serving the Petition and Order</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk must promptly forward the petition to a judge under the court's assignment procedure, and the judge must promptly examine it. If it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court, the judge must dismiss the petition and direct the clerk to notify the petitioner. If the petition is not dismissed, the judge must order the respondent to file an answer, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take other action the judge may order. In every case, the clerk must serve a copy of the petition and any order on the respondent and on the attorney general or other appropriate officer of the state involved.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4 outlines the options available to the court after the petition is properly filed. The petition must be promptly presented to and examined by the judge to whom it is assigned. If it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits attached thereto that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court, the judge must enter an order summarily dismissing the petition and cause the petitioner to be notified. If summary dismissal is not ordered, the judge must order the respondent to file an answer or to otherwise plead to the petition within a time period to be fixed in the order.</p>
<p class="note-body">28 U.S.C. &sect;2243 requires that the writ shall be awarded, or an order to show cause issued, &ldquo;unless it appears from the application that the applicant or person detained is not entitled thereto.&rdquo; Such consideration may properly encompass any exhibits attached to the petition, including, but not limited to, transcripts, sentencing records, and copies of state court opinions. The judge may order any of these items for his consideration if they are not yet included with the petition. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;753(f) which authorizes payment for transcripts in habeas corpus cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been suggested that an answer should be required in every habeas proceeding, taking into account the usual petitioner's lack of legal expertise and the important functions served by the return. See Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1178 (1970). However, under &sect;2243 it is the duty of the court to screen out frivolous applications and eliminate the burden that would be placed on the respondent by ordering an unnecessary answer. <em>Allen v. Perini</em>, 424 F.2d 134, 141 (6th Cir. 1970). In addition, &ldquo;notice&rdquo; pleading is not sufficient, for the petition is expected to state facts that point to a &ldquo;real possibility of constitutional error.&rdquo; See <em>Aubut v. State of Maine</em>, 431 F.2d 688, 689 (1st Cir. 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">In the event an answer is ordered under rule 4, the court is accorded greater flexibility than under &sect;2243 in determining within what time period an answer must be made. Under &sect;2243, the respondent must make a return within three days after being so ordered, with additional time of up to forty days allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 81(a)(2), for good cause. In view of the widespread state of work overload in prosecutors&rsquo; offices (see, <em>e.g., Allen</em>, 424 F.2d at 141), <!-- PDFPage:468 -->additional time is granted in some jurisdictions as a matter of course. Rule 4, which contains no fixed time requirement, gives the court the discretion to take into account various factors such as the respondent's workload and the availability of transcripts before determining a time within which an answer must be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4 authorizes the judge to &ldquo;take such other action as the judge deems appropriate.&rdquo; This is designed to afford the judge flexibility in a case where either dismissal or an order to answer may be inappropriate. For example, the judge may want to authorize the respondent to make a motion to dismiss based upon information furnished by respondent, which may show that petitioner's claims have already been decided on the merits in a federal court; that petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies; that the petitioner is not in custody within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254; or that a decision in the matter is pending in state court. In these situations, a dismissal may be called for on procedural grounds, which may avoid burdening the respondent with the necessity of filing an answer on the substantive merits of the petition. In other situations, the judge may want to consider a motion from respondent to make the petition more certain. Or the judge may want to dismiss some allegations in the petition, requiring the respondent to answer only those claims which appear to have some arguable merit.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4 requires that a copy of the petition and any order be served by certified mail on the respondent and the attorney general of the state involved. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2252. Presently, the respondent often does not receive a copy of the petition unless the court directs an answer under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2243. Although the attorney general is served, he is not required to answer if it is more appropriate for some other agency to do so. Although the rule does not specifically so provide, it is assumed that copies of the court orders to respondent will be mailed to petitioner by the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 4 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule reflects that the response to a habeas petition may be a motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that in every case the clerk must serve a copy of the petition on the respondent by certified mail has been deleted. In addition, the current requirement that the petition be sent to the Attorney General of the state has been modified to reflect practice in some jurisdictions that the appropriate state official may be someone other than the Attorney General, for example, the officer in charge of a local confinement facility. This comports with a similar provision in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2252, which addresses notice of habeas corpus proceedings to the state's attorney general or other appropriate officer of the state.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. The Rule was modified slightly to reflect the view of some commentators that it is common practice in some districts for the government to file a pre-answer motion to dismiss. The Committee agreed with that recommendation and changed the word &ldquo;pleading&rdquo; in the rule to &ldquo;response.&rdquo; It also made several minor changes to the Committee Note.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 5. The Answer and the Reply</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>When Required</cap-smallcap>. The respondent is not required to answer the petition unless a judge so orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents: Addressing the Allegations; Stating a Bar</cap-smallcap>. The answer must address the allegations in the petition. In addition, it must state whether any claim in the petition is barred by a failure to exhaust state remedies, a procedural bar, non-retroactivity, or a statute of limitations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contents: Transcripts</cap-smallcap>. The answer must also indicate what transcripts (of pretrial, trial, sentencing, or post-conviction proceedings) are available, when they can be furnished, and what proceedings have been recorded but not transcribed. The respondent must attach to the answer parts of the transcript that the respondent considers relevant. The judge may order that the respondent furnish other parts of existing transcripts or that parts of untranscribed recordings be transcribed and furnished. If a transcript cannot be obtained, the respondent may submit a narrative summary of the evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Contents: Briefs on Appeal and Opinions</cap-smallcap>. The respondent must also file with the answer a copy of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any brief that the petitioner submitted in an appellate court contesting the conviction or sentence, or contesting an adverse judgment or order in a post-conviction proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any brief that the prosecution submitted in an appellate court relating to the conviction or sentence; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5 details the contents of the &ldquo;answer&rdquo;. (This is a change in terminology from &ldquo;return,&rdquo; which is still used below when referring to prior practice.) The answer plays an obviously important rule in a habeas proceeding:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">The return serves several important functions: it permits the court and the parties to uncover quickly the disputed issues; it may reveal to the petitioner's attorney grounds for release that the petitioner did not know; and it may demonstrate that the petitioner's claim is wholly without merit.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1083, 1178 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">The answer must respond to the allegations of the petition. While some districts require this by local rule (see, <em>e.g</em>., E.D.N.C.R. 17(B)), under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2243 little specificity is demanded. As a result, courts occasionally receive answers which contain only a statement certifying the true cause of detention, or a series of delaying motions such as motions to dismiss. The requirement of the proposed rule that the &ldquo;answer shall respond to the allegations of the petition&rdquo; is intended to ensure that a responsive pleading will be filed and thus the functions of the answer fully served.</p>
<p class="note-body">The answer must also state whether the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies. This is a prerequisite to eligibility for the writ under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254(b) and applies to every ground the petitioner raises. Most form petitions now in use contain questions requiring information relevant to whether the petitioner has exhausted his remedies. However, the exhaustion requirement is often not understood by the unrepresented petitioner. The attorney general has both the legal expertise and access to the record and thus is in a much better position to inform the court on the matter of exhaustion of state remedies. An alleged failure to exhaust state remedies as to any ground in the petition may be raised by a motion by the attorney general, thus avoiding the necessity of a formal answer as to that ground.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule requires the answer to indicate what transcripts are available, when they can be furnished, and <!-- PDFPage:469 -->also what proceedings have been recorded and not transcribed. This will serve to inform the court and petitioner as to what factual allegations can be checked against the actual transcripts. The transcripts include pretrial transcripts relating, for example, to pretrial motions to suppress; transcripts of the trial or guilty plea proceeding; and transcripts of any post-conviction proceedings which may have taken place. The respondent is required to furnish those portions of the transcripts which he believes relevant. The court may order the furnishing of additional portions of the transcripts upon the request of petitioner or upon the court's own motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Where transcripts are unavailable, the rule provides that a narrative summary of the evidence may be submitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5 (and the general procedure set up by this entire set of rules) does not contemplate a traverse to the answer, except under special circumstances. See advisory committee note to rule 9. Therefore, the old common law assumption of verity of the allegations of a return until impeached, as codified in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2248, is no longer applicable. The meaning of the section, with its exception to the assumption &ldquo;to the extent that the judge finds from the evidence that they (the allegations) are not true,&rdquo; has given attorneys and courts a great deal of difficulty. It seems that when the petition and return pose an issue of fact, no traverse is required; <em>Stewart v. Overholser</em>, 186 F.2d 339 (D.C. Cir. 1950).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">We read &sect;2248 of the Judicial Code as not requiring a traverse when a factual issue has been clearly framed by the petition and the return or answer. This section provides that the allegations of a return or answer to an order to show cause shall be accepted as true if not traversed, except to the extent the judge finds from the evidence that they are not true. This contemplates that where the petition and return or answer do present an issue of fact material to the legality of detention, evidence is required to resolve that issue despite the absence of a traverse. This reference to evidence assumes a hearing on issues raised by the allegations of the petition and the return or answer to the order to show cause.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">186 F.2d at 342, n. 5</h4>
<p class="note-body">In actual practice, the traverse tends to be a mere pro forma refutation of the return, serving little if any expository function. In the interests of a more streamlined and manageable habeas corpus procedure, it is not required except in those instances where it will serve a truly useful purpose. Also, under rule 11 the court is given the discretion to incorporate Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when appropriate, so civil rule 15(a) may be used to allow the petitioner to amend his petition when the court feels this is called for by the contents of the answer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5 does not indicate who the answer is to be served upon, but it necessarily implies that it will be mailed to the petitioner (or to his attorney if he has one). The number of copies of the answer required is left to the court's discretion. Although the rule requires only a copy of petitioner's brief on appeal, respondent is free also to file a copy of respondent's brief. In practice, courts have found it helpful to have a copy of respondent's brief.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 5(a), which provides that the respondent is not required to file an answer to the petition, unless a judge so orders, is taken from current Rule 3(b). The revised rule does not address the practice in some districts, where the respondent files a pre-answer motion to dismiss the petition. But revised Rule 4 permits that practice and reflects the view that if the court does not dismiss the petition, it may require (or permit) the respondent to file a motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b) has been amended to require that the answer address not only failure to exhaust state remedies, but also procedural bars, non-retroactivity, and any statute of limitations. Although the latter three matters are not addressed in the current rule, the Committee intends no substantive change with the additional new language. <em>See, e.g.</em>, 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254(b)(3). Instead, the Committee believes that the explicit mention of those issues in the rule conforms to current case law and statutory provisions. <em>See, e.g.</em>, 28 U.S.C. &sect;2244(d)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 5(d) includes new material. First, Rule 5(d)(2), requires a respondent&mdash;assuming an answer is filed&mdash;to provide the court with a copy of any brief submitted by the prosecution to the appellate court. And Rule 5(d)(3) now provides that the respondent also file copies of any opinions and dispositive orders of the appellate court concerning the conviction or sentence. These provisions are intended to ensure that the court is provided with additional information that may assist it in resolving the issues raised, or not raised, in the petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, revised Rule 5(e) adopts the practice in some jurisdictions of giving the petitioner an opportunity to file a reply to the respondent's answer. Rather than using terms such as &ldquo;traverse,&rdquo; <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2248, to identify the petitioner's response to the answer, the rule uses the more general term &ldquo;reply.&rdquo; The Rule prescribes that the court set the time for such responses and in lieu of setting specific time limits in each case, the court may decide to include such time limits in its local rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. Rule 5(a) was modified to read that the government is not required to &ldquo;respond&rdquo; to the petition unless the court so orders; the term &ldquo;respond&rdquo; was used because it leaves open the possibility that the government's first response (as it is in some districts) is in the form of a pre-answer motion to dismiss the petition. The Note has been changed to reflect the fact that although the rule itself does not reflect that particular motion, it is used in some districts and refers the reader to Rule 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee also deleted the reference to &ldquo;affirmative defenses,&rdquo; because the Committee believed that the term was a misnomer in the context of habeas petitions. The Note was also changed to reflect that there has been a potential substantive change from the current rule, to the extent that the published rule now requires that the answer address procedural bars and any statute of limitations. The Note states that the Committee believes the new language reflects current law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Note was modified to address the use of the term &ldquo;traverse.&rdquo; One commentator noted that that is the term that is commonly used but that it does not appear in the rule itself.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 6. Discovery</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Leave of Court Required</cap-smallcap>. A judge may, for good cause, authorize a party to conduct discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and may limit the extent of discovery. If necessary for effective discovery, the judge must appoint an attorney for a petitioner who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Requesting Discovery</cap-smallcap>. A party requesting discovery must provide reasons for the request. The request must also include any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Deposition Expenses</cap-smallcap>. If the respondent is granted leave to take a deposition, the judge may require the respondent to pay the travel expenses, subsistence expenses, and fees of the petitioner's attorney to attend the deposition.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule prescribes the procedures governing discovery in habeas corpus cases. Subdivision (a) provides that any party may utilize the processes of discovery available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (rules 26&ndash;37) if, and to the extent that, the judge allows. It also provides for the appointment of counsel for a petitioner who qualifies for this when counsel is necessary for effective utilization of discovery procedures permitted by the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is consistent with <em>Harris v. Nelson</em>, 394 U.S. 286 (1969). In that case the court noted,</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[I]t is clear that there was no intention to extend to habeas corpus, as a matter of right, the broad discovery provisions *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* of the new [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure].</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-end:notes -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">394 U.S. at 295</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">However, citing the lack of methods for securing information in habeas proceedings, the court pointed to an alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Clearly, in these circumstances *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the courts may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Their authority is expressly confirmed in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">394 U.S. at 299</h4>
<p class="note-body">The court concluded that the issue of discovery in habeas corpus cases could best be dealt with as part of an effort to provide general rules of practice for habeas corpus cases:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">In fact, it is our view that the rulemaking machinery should be invoked to formulate rules of practice with respect to federal habeas corpus and &sect;2255 proceedings, on a comprehensive basis and not merely one confined to discovery. The problems presented by these proceedings are materially different from those dealt with in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and reliance upon usage and the opaque language of Civil Rule 81(a)(2) is transparently inadequate. In our view the results of a meticulous formulation and adoption of special rules for federal habeas corpus and &sect;2255 proceedings would promise much benefit.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">394 U.S. at 301 n. 7</h4>
<p class="note-body">Discovery may, in appropriate cases, aid in developing facts necessary to decide whether to order an evidentiary hearing or to grant the writ following an evidentiary hearing:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">We are aware that confinement sometimes induces fantasy which has its basis in the paranoia of prison rather than in fact. But where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is confined illegally and is therefore entitled to relief, it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry. Obviously, in exercising this power, the court may utilize familiar procedures, as appropriate, whether these are found in the civil or criminal rules or elsewhere in the &ldquo;usages and principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Granting discovery is left to the discretion of the court, discretion to be exercised where there is a showing of good cause why discovery should be allowed. Several commentators have suggested that at least some discovery should be permitted without leave of court. It is argued that the courts will be burdened with weighing the propriety of requests to which the discovered party has no objection. Additionally, the availability of protective orders under Fed.R.Civ.R., Rules 30(b) and 31(d) will provide the necessary safeguards. See Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1186&ndash;87 (1970); Civil Discovery in Habeas Corpus, 67 Colum.L.Rev. 1296, 1310 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">Nonetheless, it is felt the requirement of prior court approval of all discovery is necessary to prevent abuse, so this requirement is specifically mandated in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">While requests for discovery in habeas proceedings normally follow the granting of an evidentiary hearing, there may be instances in which discovery would be appropriate beforehand. Such an approach was advocated in <em>Wagner v. United States</em>, 418 F.2d 618, 621 (9th Cir. 1969), where the opinion stated the trial court could permit interrogatories, provide for deposing witnesses, &ldquo;and take such other prehearing steps as may be appropriate.&rdquo; While this was an action under &sect;2255, the reasoning would apply equally well to petitions by state prisoners. Such pre-hearing discovery may show an evidentiary hearing to be unnecessary, as when there are &ldquo;no disputed issues of law or fact.&rdquo; 83 Harv. L.Rev. 1038, 1181 (1970). The court in Harris alluded to such a possibility when it said &ldquo;the court may *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* authorize such proceedings with respect to development, <em>before or in conjunction with the hearing</em> of the facts *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; [emphasis added] 394 U.S. at 300. Such pre-hearing discovery, like all discovery under rule 6, requires leave of court. In addition, the provisions in rule 7 for the use of an expanded record may eliminate much of the need for this type of discovery. While probably not as frequently sought or granted as discovery in conjunction with a hearing, it may nonetheless serve a valuable function.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to make pre-hearing discovery meaningful, subdivision (a) provides that the judge should appoint counsel for a petitioner who is without counsel and qualifies for appointment when this is necessary for the proper utilization of discovery procedures. Rule 8 provides for the appointment of counsel at the evidentiary hearing stage (see rule 8(b) and advisory committee note), but this would not assist the petitioner who seeks to utilize discovery to stave off dismissal of his petition (see rule 9 and advisory committee note) or to demonstrate that an evidentiary hearing is necessary. Thus, if the judge grants a petitioner's request for discovery prior to making a decision as to the necessity for an evidentiary hearing, he should determine whether counsel is necessary for the effective utilization of such discovery and, if so, appoint counsel for the petitioner if the petitioner qualifies for such appointment.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule contains very little specificity as to what types and methods of discovery should be made available to the parties in a habeas proceeding, or how, once made available, these discovery procedures should be administered. The purpose of this rule is to get some experience in how discovery would work in actual practice by letting district court judges fashion their own rules in the context of individual cases. When the results of such experience are available it would be desirable to consider whether further, more specific codification should take place.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) provides for judicial consideration of all matters subject to discovery. A statement of the interrogatories, or requests for admission sought to be answered, and a list of any documents sought to be produced, must accompany a request for discovery. This is to advise the judge of the necessity for discovery and enable him to make certain that the inquiry is relevant and appropriately narrow.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) refers to the situation where the respondent is granted leave to take the deposition of the petitioner or any other person. In such a case the judge may direct the respondent to pay the expenses and fees of counsel for the petitioner to attend the taking of the deposition, as a condition granting the respondent such leave. While the judge is not required to impose this condition subdivision (c) will give the court the means to do so. Such a provision affords some protection to the indigent petitioner who may be prejudiced by his inability to have counsel, often court-appointed, present at the taking of a deposition. It is recognized that under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(g), court-appointed counsel in a &sect;2254 proceeding is entitled to receive up to $250 and reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred. (Compare Fed.R. Crim.P. 15(c).) Typically, however, <!-- PDFPage:471 -->this does not adequately reimburse counsel if he must attend the taking of depositions or be involved in other pre-hearing proceedings. Subdivision (c) is intended to provide additional funds, if necessary, to be paid by the state government (respondent) to petitioner's counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the rule does not specifically so provide, it is assumed that a petitioner who qualifies for the appointment of counsel under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(g) and is granted leave to take a deposition will be allowed witness costs. This will include recording and transcription of the witness's statement. Such costs are payable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1825. See Opinion of Comptroller General, February 28, 1974.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) specifically recognizes the right of the respondent to take the deposition of the petitioner. Although the petitioner could not be called to testify against his will in a criminal trial, it is felt the nature of the habeas proceeding, along with the safeguards accorded by the Fifth Amendment and the presence of counsel, justify this provision. See 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1183&ndash;84 (1970).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule provides that the judge may direct that the record be expanded. The purpose is to enable the judge to dispose of some habeas petitions not dismissed on the pleadings, without the time and expense required for an evidentiary hearing. An expanded record may also be helpful when an evidentiary hearing is ordered.</p>
<p class="note-body">The record may be expanded to include additional material relevant to the merits of the petition. While most petitions are dismissed either summarily or after a response has been made, of those that remain, by far the majority require an evidentiary hearing. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, for example, of 8,423 &sect;2254 cases terminated, 8,231 required court action. Of these, 7,812 were dismissed before a prehearing conference and 469 merited further court action (<em>e.g</em>., expansion of the record, prehearing conference, or an evidentiary hearing). Of the remaining 469 cases, 403 required an evidentiary hearing, often time-consuming, costly, and, at least occasionally, unnecessary. See Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report, 245a&ndash;245c (table C4) (1970). In some instances these hearings were necessitated by slight omissions in the state record which might have been cured by the use of an expanded record.</p>
<p class="note-body">Authorizing expansion of the record will, hopefully, eliminate some unnecessary hearings. The value of this approach was articulated in <em>Raines v. United States</em>, 423 F.2d 526, 529&ndash;530 (4th Cir. 1970):</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Unless it is clear from the pleadings and the files and records that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the statute makes a hearing mandatory. We think there is a permissible intermediate step that may avoid the necessity for an expensive and time consuming evidentiary hearing in every Section 2255 case. It may instead be perfectly appropriate, depending upon the nature of the allegations, for the district court to proceed by requiring that the record be expanded to include letters, documentary evidence, and, in an appropriate case, even affidavits. <em>United States v. Carlino</em>, 400 F.2d 56 (2nd Cir. 1968); <em>Mirra v. United States</em>, 379 F.2d 782 (2nd Cir. 1967); <em>Accardi v. United States</em>, 379 F.2d 312 (2nd Cir. 1967). When the issue is one of credibility, resolution on the basis of affidavits can rarely be conclusive, but that is not to say they may not be helpful.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Harris v. Nelson</em>, 394 U.S. 286, 300 (1969), the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">At any time in the proceedings *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <em>either on [the court's] own motion</em> or upon cause shown by the petitioner, it may issue such writs and take or authorize such proceedings *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <em>before</em> or in conjunction with the hearing of the facts *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) specifies the materials which may be added to the record. These include, without limitation, letters predating the filing of the petition in the district court, documents, exhibits, and answers under oath directed to written interrogatories propounded by the judge. Under this subdivision affidavits may be submitted and considered part of the record. Subdivision (b) is consistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2246 and 2247 and the decision in <em>Raines</em> with regard to types of material that may be considered upon application for a writ of habeas corpus. See <em>United States v. Carlino</em>, 400 F.2d 56, 58 (2d Cir. 1968), and <em>Machibroda v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 487 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (c) all materials proposed to be included in the record must be submitted to the party against whom they are to be offered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (d) the judge can require authentication if he believes it desirable to do so.</p>

<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 7(a) is not intended to restrict the court's authority to expand the record through means other than requiring the parties themselves to provide the information.

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 8. Evidentiary Hearing</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Determining Whether to Hold a Hearing</cap-smallcap>.

A judge may, under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b), refer the petition to a magistrate judge to conduct hearings and to file proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition. When they are filed, the clerk must promptly serve copies of the proposed findings and recommendations on all parties. Within 10 days after being served, a party may file objections as provided by local court rule. The judge must determine de novo any proposed finding or recommendation to which objection is made. The judge may accept, reject, or modify any proposed finding or recommendation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appointing Counsel; Time of Hearing</cap-smallcap>.

These rules do not limit the appointment of counsel under &sect;3006A at any stage of the proceeding.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule outlines the procedure to be followed by the court immediately prior to and after the determination of whether to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions are applicable if the petition has not been dismissed at a previous stage in the proceeding [including a summary dismissal under rule 4; a dismissal pursuant to a motion by the respondent; a dismissal after the answer and petition are considered; or a dismissal after consideration of the pleadings and an expanded record].</p>
<p class="note-body">If dismissal has not been ordered, the court must determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required. This determination is to be made upon a review of the answer, the transcript and record of state court proceedings, and if there is one, the expanded record. As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Townsend v. Sam</em>, 372 U.S. 293, 319 (1963):</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Ordinarily [the complete state-court] record&mdash;including the transcript of testimony (or if unavailable some adequate substitute, such as a narrative record), the pleadings, court opinions, and other pertinent documents&mdash;is indispensable to determining whether the habeas applicant received a full and fair state-court evidentiary hearing resulting in reliable findings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) contemplates that all of these materials, if available, will be taken into account. This is especially important in view of the standard set down in <em>Townsend</em> for determining <em>when</em> a hearing in the federal habeas proceeding is mandatory.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">The appropriate standard *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is this: Where the facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-end:notes -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">372 U.S. at 312</h4>
<p class="note-body">The circumstances under which a federal hearing is mandatory are now specified in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254(d). The 1966 amendment clearly places the burden on the petitioner, when there has already been a state hearing, to show that it was not a fair or adequate hearing for one or more of the specifically enumerated reasons, in order to force a federal evidentiary hearing. Since the function of an evidentiary hearing is to try issues of fact (372 U.S. at 309), such a hearing is unnecessary when only issues of law are raised. See, <em>e.g., Yeaman v. United States</em>, 326 F.2d 293 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>
<p class="note-body">In situations in which an evidentiary hearing is not mandatory, the judge may nonetheless decide that an evidentiary hearing is desirable:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">The purpose of the test is to indicate the situations in which the holding of an evidentiary hearing is mandatory. In all other cases where the material facts are in dispute, the holding of such a hearing is in the discretion of the district judge.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">372 U.S. at 318</h4>
<p class="note-body">If the judge decides that an evidentiary hearing is neither required nor desirable, he shall make such a disposition of the petition &ldquo;as justice shall require.&rdquo; Most habeas petitions are dismissed before the prehearing conference stage (see Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report 245a&ndash;245c (table C4) (1970)) and of those not dismissed, the majority raise factual issues that necessitate an evidentiary hearing. If no hearing is required, most petitions are dismissed, but in unusual cases the court may grant the relief sought without a hearing. This includes immediate release from custody or nullification of a judgment under which the sentence is to be served in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) provides that a magistrate, when so empowered by rule of the district court, may recommend to the district judge that an evidentiary hearing be held or that the petition be dismissed, provided he gives the district judge a sufficiently detailed description of the facts so that the judge may decide whether or not to hold an evidentiary hearing. This provision is not inconsistent with the holding in <em>Wingo v. Wedding</em>, 418 U.S. 461 (1974), that the Federal Magistrates Act did not change the requirement of the habeas corpus statute that federal judges personally conduct habeas evidentiary hearings, and that consequently a local district court rule was invalid insofar as it authorized a magistrate to hold such hearings. 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b) provides that a district court may by rule authorize any magistrate to perform certain additional duties, including preliminary review of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses, and submission of a report and recommendations to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdiction over the case as to whether there should be a hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">As noted in <em>Wingo</em>, review &ldquo;by Magistrates of applications for post-trial relief is thus limited to review for the purpose of proposing, not holding, evidentiary hearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Utilization of the magistrate as specified in subdivision (b) will aid in the expeditious and fair handling of habeas petitions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">A qualified, experienced magistrate will, it is hoped, acquire an expertise in examining these [postconviction review] applications and summarizing their important contents for the district judge, thereby facilitating his decisions. Law clerks are presently charged with this responsibility by many judges, but judges have noted that the normal 1-year clerkship does not afford law clerks the time or experience necessary to attain real efficiency in handling such applications.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:473 --><h4 class="analysis-subhead">S. Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1967)</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (c) there are two provisions that differ from the procedure set forth in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2243. These are the appointment of counsel and standard for determining how soon the hearing will be held.</p>
<p class="note-body">If an evidentiary hearing is required the judge must appoint counsel for a petitioner who qualified for appointment under the Criminal Justice Act. Currently, the appointment of counsel is not recognized as a right at any stage of a habeas proceeding. See, <em>e.g., United States ex rel. Marshall v. Wilkins</em>, 338 F.2d 404 (2d Cir. 1964). Some district courts have, however, by local rule, required that counsel must be provided for indigent petitioners in cases requiring a hearing. See, <em>e.g</em>., D.N.M.R. 21(f), E.D. N.Y.R. 26(d). Appointment of counsel at this stage is mandatory under subdivision (c). This requirement will not limit the authority of the court to provide counsel at an earlier stage if it is thought desirable to do so as is done in some courts under current practice. At the evidentiary hearing stage, however, an indigent petitioner's access to counsel should not depend on local practice and, for this reason, the furnishing of counsel is made mandatory.</p>
<p class="note-body">Counsel can perform a valuable function benefiting both the court and the petitioner. The issues raised can be more clearly identified if both sides have the benefit of trained legal personnel. The presence of counsel at the prehearing conference may help to expedite the evidentiary hearing or make it unnecessary, and counsel will be able to make better use of available prehearing discovery procedures. Compare ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies &sect;4.4, p. 66 (Approved Draft 1968). At a hearing, the petitioner's claims are more likely to be effectively and properly presented by counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(g), payment is allowed counsel up to $250, plus reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred. The standards of indigency under this section are less strict than those regarding eligibility to prosecute a petition in forma pauperis, and thus many who cannot qualify to proceed under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1915 will be entitled to the benefits of counsel under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(g). Under rule 6(c), the court may order the respondent to reimburse counsel from state funds for fees and expenses incurred as the result of the utilization of discovery procedures by the respondent.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that the hearing shall be conducted as promptly as possible, taking into account &ldquo;the need of counsel for both parties for adequate time for investigation and preparation.&rdquo; This differs from the language of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2243, which requires that the day for the hearing be set &ldquo;not more than five days after the return unless for good cause additional time is allowed.&rdquo; This time limit fails to take into account the function that may be served by a prehearing conference and the time required to prepare adequately for an evidentiary hearing. Although &ldquo;additional time&rdquo; is often allowed under &sect;2243, subdivision (c) provides more flexibility to take account of the complexity of the case, the availability of important materials, the workload of the attorney general, and the time required by appointed counsel to prepare.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the rule does not make specific provision for a prehearing conference, the omission is not intended to cast doubt upon the value of such a conference:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">The conference may limit the questions to be resolved, identify areas of agreement and dispute, and explore evidentiary problems that may be expected to arise. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [S]uch conferences may also disclose that a hearing is unnecessary *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is intended to minimize abuse of the writ of habeas corpus by limiting the right to assert stale claims and to file multiple petitions. Subdivision (a) deals with the delayed petition. Subdivision (b) deals with the second or successive petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) provides that a petition attacking the judgment of a state court may be dismissed on the <!-- PDFPage:474 -->grounds of delay if the petitioner knew or should have known of the existence of the grounds he is presently asserting in the petition and the delay has resulted in the state being prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition. If the delay is more than five years after the judgment of conviction, prejudice is presumed, although this presumption is rebuttable by the petitioner. Otherwise, the state has the burden of showing such prejudice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assertion of stale claims is a problem which is not likely to decrease in frequency. Following the decisions in <em>Jones v. Cunningham</em>, 371 U.S. 236 (1963), and <em>Benson v. California</em>, 328 F.2d 159 (9th Cir. 1964), the concept of custody expanded greatly, lengthening the time period during which a habeas corpus petition may be filed. The petitioner who is not unconditionally discharged may be on parole or probation for many years. He may at some date, perhaps ten or fifteen years after conviction, decide to challenge the state court judgment. The grounds most often troublesome to the courts are ineffective counsel, denial of right of appeal, plea of guilty unlawfully induced, use of a coerced confession, and illegally constituted jury. The latter four grounds are often interlocked with the allegation of ineffective counsel. When they are asserted after the passage of many years, both the attorney for the defendant and the state have difficulty in ascertaining what the facts are. It often develops that the defense attorney has little or no recollection as to what took place and that many of the participants in the trial are dead or their whereabouts unknown. The court reporter's notes may have been lost or destroyed, thus eliminating any exact record of what transpired. If the case was decided on a guilty plea, even if the record is intact, it may not satisfactorily reveal the extent of the defense attorney's efforts in behalf of the petitioner. As a consequence, there is obvious difficulty in investigating petitioner's allegations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The interest of both the petitioner and the government can best be served if claims are raised while the evidence is still fresh. The American Bar Association has recognized the interest of the state in protecting itself against stale claims by limiting the right to raise such claims after completion of service of a sentence imposed pursuant to a challenged judgment. See ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies &sect;2.4 (c), p. 45 (Approved Draft, 1968). Subdivision (a) is not limited to those who have completed their sentence. Its reach is broader, extending to all instances where delay by the petitioner has prejudiced the state, subject to the qualifications and conditions contained in the subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>McMann v. Richardson</em>, 397 U.S. 759 (1970), the court made reference to the issue of the stale claim:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">What is at stake in this phase of the case is not the integrity of the state convictions obtained on guilty pleas, <em>but whether, years later</em>, defendants must be permitted to withdraw their pleas, which were perfectly valid when made, and be given another choice between admitting their guilt and putting the State to its proof. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">397 U.S. at 773</h4>
<p class="note-body">The court refused to allow this, intimating its dislike of collateral attacks on sentences long since imposed which disrupt the state's interest in finality of convictions which were constitutionally valid when obtained.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is not a statute of limitations. Rather, the limitation is based on the equitable doctrine of laches. &ldquo;Laches is such delay in enforcing one's rights as works disadvantage to another.&rdquo; 30A C.J.S. Equity &sect;112, p. 19. Also, the language of the subdivision, &ldquo;a petition <em>may</em> be dismissed&rdquo; [emphasis added], is permissive rather than mandatory. This clearly allows the court which is considering the petition to use discretion in assessing the equities of the particular situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of a flexible rule analogous to laches to bar the assertion of stale claims is suggested in ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies &sect;2.4, commentary at 48 (Approved Draft, 1968). Additionally, in <em>Fay v. Noia</em>, 372 U.S. 391 (1963), the Supreme Court noted:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Furthermore, habeas corpus has traditionally been regarded as governed by equitable principles. <em>United States ex rel. Smith v. Baldi</em>, 344 U.S. 561, 573 (dissenting opinion). Among them is the principle that a suitor's conduct in relation to the matter at hand may disentitle him to the relief he seeks.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">372 U.S. at 438</h4>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the doctrine of laches has been applied with reference to another postconviction remedy, the writ of coram nobis. See 24 C.J.S. Criminal Law &sect;1606(25), p. 779.</p>
<p class="note-body">The standard used for determining if the petitioner shall be barred from asserting his claim is consistent with that used in laches provisions generally. The petitioner is held to a standard of reasonable diligence. Any inference or presumption arising by reason of the failure to attack collaterally a conviction may be disregarded where (1) there has been a change of law or fact (new evidence) or (2) where the court, in the interest of justice, feels that the collateral attack should be entertained and the prisoner makes a proper showing as to why he has not asserted a particular ground for relief.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) establishes the presumption that the passage of more than five years from the time of the judgment of conviction to the time of filing a habeas petition is prejudicial to the state. &ldquo;Presumption&rdquo; has the meaning given it by Fed.R.Evid. 301. The prisoner has &ldquo;the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption&rdquo; that the state has not been prejudiced by the passage of a substantial period of time. This does not impose too heavy a burden on the petitioner. He usually knows what persons are important to the issue of whether the state has been prejudiced. Rule 6 can be used by the court to allow petitioner liberal discovery to learn whether witnesses have died or whether other circumstances prejudicial to the state have occurred. Even if the petitioner should fail to overcome the presumption of prejudice to the state, he is not automatically barred from asserting his claim. As discussed previously, he may proceed if he neither knew nor, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have known of the grounds for relief.</p>
<p class="note-body">The presumption of prejudice does not come into play if the time lag is not more than five years.</p>
<p class="note-body">The time limitation should have a positive effect in encouraging petitioners who have knowledge of it to assert all their claims as soon after conviction as possible. The implementation of this rule can be substantially furthered by the development of greater legal resources for prisoners. See ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies &sect;3.1, pp. 49&ndash;50 (Approved Draft, 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) does not constitute an abridgement or modification of a substantive right under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2072. There are safeguards for the hardship case. The rule provides a flexible standard for determining when a petition will be barred.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) deals with the problem of successive habeas petitions. It provides that the judge may dismiss a second or successive petition (1) if it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief or (2) if new or different grounds for relief are alleged and the judge finds the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition is inexcusable.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Sanders v. United States</em>, 373 U.S. 1 (1963), the court, in dealing with the problem of successive applications, stated:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Controlling weight <em>may</em> be given to denial of a prior application for federal habeas corpus or &sect;2255 relief only if (1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<!-- PDFPage:475 --><h4 class="analysis-subhead">373 U.S. at 15</h4>
<p class="note-body">The requirement is that the prior determination of the same ground has been on the merits. This requirement is in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2244(b) and has been reiterated in many cases since <em>Sanders</em>. See <em>Gains v. Allgood</em>, 391 F.2d 692 (5th Cir. 1968); <em>Hutchinson v. Craven</em>, 415 F.2d 278 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>Brown v. Peyton</em>, 435 F.2d 1352 (4th Cir. 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">With reference to a successive application asserting a new ground or one not previously decided on the merits, the court in <em>Sanders</em> noted:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">In either case, full consideration of the merits of the new application can be avoided only if there has been an abuse of the writ *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and this the Government has the burden of pleading. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Thus, for example, if a prisoner deliberately withholds one of two grounds for federal collateral relief at the time of filing his first application, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* he may be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on a second application presenting the withheld ground.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">373 U.S. at 17&ndash;18</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">Subdivision (b) has incorporated this principle and requires that the judge find petitioner's failure to have asserted the new grounds in the prior petition to be inexcusable.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Sanders</em>, 18 U.S.C. &sect;2244, and subdivision (b) make it clear that the court has discretion to entertain a successive application.</p>
<p class="note-body">The burden is on the government to plead abuse of the writ. See <em>Sanders v. United States</em>, 373 U.S. 1, 10 (1963); <em>Dixon v. Jacobs</em>, 427 F.2d 589, 596 (D.C.Cir. 1970); cf. <em>Johnson v. Copinger</em>, 420 F.2d 395 (4th Cir. 1969). Once the government has done this, the petitioner has the burden of proving that he has not abused the writ. In <em>Price v. Johnston</em>, 334 U.S. 266, 292 (1948), the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[I]f the Government chooses *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to claim that the prisoner has abused the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, it rests with the Government to make that claim with clarity and particularity in its return to the order to show cause. That is not an intolerable burden. The Government is usually well acquainted with the facts that are necessary to make such a claim. Once a particular abuse has been alleged, the prisoner has the burden of answering that allegation and of proving that he has not abused the writ.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is consistent with the important and well established purpose of habeas corpus. It does not eliminate a remedy to which the petitioner is rightfully entitled. However, in <em>Sanders</em>, the court pointed out:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Nothing in the traditions of habeas corpus requires the federal courts to tolerate needless piecemeal litigation, or to entertain collateral proceedings whose only purpose is to vex, harass, or delay.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">373 U.S. at 18</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">There are instances in which petitioner's failure to assert a ground in a prior petition is excusable. A retroactive change in the law and newly discovered evidence are examples. In rare instances, the court may feel a need to entertain a petition alleging grounds that have already been decided on the merits. <em>Sanders</em>, 373 U.S. at 1, 16. However, abusive use of the writ should be discouraged, and instances of abuse are frequent enough to require a means of dealing with them. For example, a successive application, already decided on the merits, may be submitted in the hope of getting before a different judge in multijudge courts. A known ground may be deliberately withheld in the hope of getting two or more hearings or in the hope that delay will result in witnesses and records being lost. There are instances in which a petitioner will have three or four petitions pending at the same time in the same court. There are many hundreds of cases where the application is at least the second one by the petitioner. This subdivision is aimed at screening out the abusive petitions from this large volume, so that the more meritorious petitions can get quicker and fuller consideration.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form petition, supplied in accordance with rule 2(c), encourages the petitioner to raise all of his available grounds in one petition. It sets out the most common grounds asserted so that these may be brought to his attention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some commentators contend that the problem of abuse of the writ of habeas corpus is greatly overstated:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Most prisoners, of course, are interested in being released as soon as possible; only rarely will one inexcusably neglect to raise all available issues in his first federal application. The purpose of the &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; bar is apparently to deter repetitious applications from those few bored or vindictive prisoners *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">83 Harv.L.Rev. at 1153&ndash;1154</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">See also ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies &sect;6.2, commentary at 92 (Approved Draft, 1968), which states: &ldquo;The occasional, highly litigious prisoner stands out as the rarest exception.&rdquo; While no recent systematic study of repetitious applications exists, there is no reason to believe that the problem has decreased in significance in relation to the total number of &sect;2254 petitions filed. That number has increased from 584 in 1949 to 12,088 in 1971. See Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report, table 16 (1971). It is appropriate that action be taken by rule to allow the courts to deal with this problem, whatever its specific magnitude. The bar set up by subdivision (b) is not one of rigid application, but rather is within the discretion of the courts on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">If it appears to the court after examining the petition and answer (where appropriate) that there is a high probability that the petition will be barred under either subdivision of rule 9, the court ought to afford petitioner an opportunity to explain his apparent abuse. One way of doing this is by the use of the form annexed hereto. The use of a form will ensure a full airing of the issue so that the court is in a better position to decide whether the petition should be barred. This conforms with <em>Johnson v. Copinger</em>, 420 F.2d 395 (4th Cir. 1969), where the court stated:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[T]he petitioner is obligated to present facts demonstrating that his earlier failure to raise his claims is excusable and does not amount to an abuse of the writ. However, it is inherent in this obligation placed upon the petitioner that he must be given an opportunity to make his explanation, if he has one. If he is not afforded such an opportunity, the requirement that he satisfy the court that he has not abused the writ is meaningless. Nor do we think that a procedure which allows the imposition of a forfeiture for abuse of the writ, without allowing the petitioner an opportunity to be heard on the issue, comports with the minimum requirements of fairness.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">420 F.2d at 399</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">Use of the recommended form will contribute to an orderly handling of habeas petitions and will contribute to the ability of the court to distinguish the excusable from the inexcusable delay or failure to assert a ground for relief in a prior petition.</p>

<p class="note-body">Under this rule the duties imposed upon the judge of the district court by rules 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 may be performed by a magistrate if and to the extent he is empowered to do so by a rule of the district court. However, when such duties involve the making of an order under rule 4 disposing of the petition, that order must be made by the court. The magistrate in such instances must submit to the court his report as to the facts and his recommendation with respect to the order.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Magistrates Act allows magistrates, when empowered by local rule, to perform certain functions in proceedings for post-trial relief. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(3). The performance of such functions, when authorized, is intended to &ldquo;afford some degree of relief to district judges and their law clerks, who are presently burdened with burgeoning numbers of habeas corpus petitions and applications under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255.&rdquo; Committee on the Judiciary, The Federal Magistrates Act, S.Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st sess., 26 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b), any district court,</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, may establish rules pursuant to which any full-time United States magistrate *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may be assigned within the territorial jurisdiction of such court such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The proposed rule recognizes the limitations imposed by 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b) upon the powers of magistrates to act in federal postconviction proceedings. These limitations are: (1) that the magistrate may act only pursuant to a rule passed by the majority of the judges in the district court in which the magistrate serves, and (2) that the duties performed by the magistrate pursuant to such rule be consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been suggested that magistrates be empowered by law to hold hearings and make final decisions in habeas proceedings. See Proposed Reformation of Federal Habeas Corpus Procedure: Use of Federal Magistrates, 54 Iowa L.Rev. 1147, 1158 (1969). However, the Federal Magistrates Act does not authorize such use of magistrates. <em>Wingo v. Wedding</em>, 418 U.S. 461 (1974). See advisory committee note to rule 8. While the use of magistrates can help alleviate the strain imposed on the district courts by the large number of unmeritorious habeas petitions, neither 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b) nor this rule contemplate the abdication by the court of its decision-making responsibility. See also Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L.Rev. 1038, 1188 (1970)</p>
<p class="note-body">Where a full-time magistrate is not available, the duties contemplated by this rule may be assigned to a part-time magistrate.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment conforms the rule to subsequently enacted legislation clarifying and further defining the duties which may be assigned to a magistrate, 18 U.S.C. &sect;636, as amended in 1976 by Pub.

To the extent that rule 10 is more restrictive than &sect;636, the limitations are of no effect, for the statute expressly governs &ldquo;[n]otwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to particular rules is stricken, as under &sect;636(b)(1)(A) a judge may designate a magistrate to perform duties under other rules as well (e.g., order that further transcripts be furnished under rule 5; appoint counsel under rule 8). The reference to &ldquo;established standards and criteria&rdquo; is stricken, as &sect;636(4) requires each district court to &ldquo;establish rules pursuant to which the magistrates shall discharge their duties.&rdquo; The exception with respect to a rule 4 order dismissing a petition is stricken, as that limitation appears in &sect;636(b)(1)(B) and is thereby applicable to certain other actions under these rules as well (e.g., determination of a need for an evidentiary hearing under rule 8; dismissal of a delayed or successive petition under rule 9).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Habeas corpus proceedings are characterized as civil in nature. See <em>e.g., Fisher v. Baker</em>, 203 U.S. 174, 181 (1906). However, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(2), the applicability of the civil rules to habeas corpus actions has been limited, although the various courts which have considered this problem have had difficulty in setting out the boundaries of this limitation. See <em>Harris v. Nelson</em>, 394 U.S. 286 (1969) at 289, footnote 1. Rule 11 is intended to conform with the Supreme Court's approach in the <em>Harris</em> case. There the court was dealing with the petitioner's contention that Civil Rule 33 granting the right to discovery via written interrogatories is wholly applicable to habeas corpus proceedings. The court held:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">We agree with the Ninth Circuit that Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not applicable to habeas corpus proceedings and that 28 U.S.C. &sect;2246 does not authorize interrogatories except in limited circumstances not applicable to this case; but we conclude that, in appropriate circumstances, a district court, confronted by a petition for habeas corpus <!-- PDFPage:477 -->which establishes a prima facie case for relief, may use or authorize the use of suitable discovery procedures, including interrogatories, reasonably fashioned to elicit facts necessary to help the court to &ldquo;dispose of the matter as law and justice require&rdquo; 28 U.S.C. &sect;2243.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">394 U.S. at 290</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">The court then went on to consider the contention that the &ldquo;conformity&rdquo; provision of Rule 81(a)(2) should be rigidly applied so that the civil rules would be applicable only to the extent that habeas corpus practice had conformed to the practice in civil actions at the time of the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on September 16, 1938. The court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Although there is little direct evidence, relevant to the present problem, of the purpose of the &ldquo;conformity&rdquo; provision of Rule 81(a)(2), the concern of the draftsmen, as a general matter, seems to have been to provide for the continuing applicability of the &ldquo;civil&rdquo; rules in their new form to those areas of practice in habeas corpus and other enumerated proceedings in which the &ldquo;specified&rdquo; proceedings had theretofore utilized the modes of civil practice. Otherwise, those proceedings were to be considered outside of the scope of the rules without prejudice, of course, to the use of particular rules by analogy or otherwise, where appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">394 U.S. at 294</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">The court then reiterated its commitment to judicial discretion in formulating rules and procedures for habeas corpus proceedings by stating:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[T]he habeas corpus jurisdiction and the duty to exercise it being present, the courts may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Where their duties require it, this is the inescapable obligation of the courts. Their authority is expressly confirmed in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">394 U.S. at 299</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 6 of these proposed rules deals specifically with the issue of discovery in habeas actions in a manner consistent with <em>Harris</em>. Rule 11 extends this approach to allow the court considering the petition to use any of the rules of civil procedure (unless inconsistent with these rules of habeas corpus) when in its discretion the court decides they are appropriate under the circumstances of the particular case. The court does not have to rigidly apply rules which would be inconsistent or inequitable in the overall framework of habeas corpus. Rule 11 merely recognizes and affirms their discretionary power to use their judgment in promoting the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 11 permits application of the civil rules only when it would be appropriate to do so. Illustrative of an inappropriate application is that rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Pitchess v. Davis</em>, 95 S.Ct. 1748 (1975), holding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) should not be applied in a habeas case when it would have the effect of altering the statutory exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A court may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from the latest of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:495 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act, in all proceedings brought under this section, and any subsequent proceedings on review, the court may appoint counsel, except as provided by a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Appointment of counsel under this section shall be governed by section 3006A of title 18.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The basic scope of this postconviction remedy is prescribed by 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. Under these rules the person seeking relief from federal custody files a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, rather than a petition for habeas corpus. This is consistent with the terminology used in section 2255 and indicates the difference between this remedy and federal habeas for a state prisoner. Also, habeas corpus is available to the person in federal custody if his &ldquo;remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Whereas sections 2241&ndash;2254 (dealing with federal habeas corpus for those in state custody) speak of the district court judge &ldquo;issuing the writ&rdquo; as the operative remedy, section 2255 provides that, if the judge finds the movant's assertions to be meritorious, he &ldquo;shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.&rdquo; This is possible because a motion under &sect;2255 is a further step in the movant's criminal case and not a separate civil action, as appears from the legislative history of section 2 of S. 20, 80th Congress, the provisions of which were incorporated by the same Congress in title 28 U.S.C. as &sect;2255. In reporting S. 20 favorably the Senate Judiciary Committee said (Sen. Rep. 1526, 80th Cong. 2d Sess., p. 2):</p>
<p class="note-body">The two main advantages of such motion remedy over the present habeas corpus are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, habeas corpus is a separate civil action and not a further step in the criminal case in which petitioner is sentenced (<em>Ex parte Tom Tong</em>, 108 U.S. 556, 559 (1883)). It is not a determination of guilt or innocence of the charge upon which petitioner was sentenced. Where a prisoner sustains his right to discharge in habeas corpus, it is usually because some right&mdash;such as lack of counsel&mdash;has been denied which reflects no determination of his guilt or innocence but affects solely the fairness of his earlier criminal trial. Even under the broad power in the statute &ldquo;to dispose of the party as law and justice require&rdquo; (28 U.S.C.A., sec. 461), the court or judge is by no means in the same advantageous position in habeas corpus to do justice as would be so if the matter were determined in the criminal proceeding (see <em>Medley</em>, petitioner, 134 U.S. 160, 174 (1890)). For instance, the judge (by habeas corpus) cannot grant a new trial in the criminal case. Since the motion remedy is in the criminal proceeding, this section 2 affords the opportunity and expressly gives the broad powers to set aside the judgment and to &ldquo;discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The fact that a motion under &sect;2255 is a further step in the movant's criminal case rather than a separate civil action has significance at several points in these rules. See, <em>e.g</em>., advisory committee note to rule 3 (re no filing fee), advisory committee note to rule 4 (re availability of files, etc., relating to the judgment), advisory committee note to rule 6 (re availability of discovery under criminal procedure rules), advisory committee note to rule 11 (re no extension of time for appeal), and advisory committee not to rule 12 (re applicability of federal criminal rules). However, the fact that Congress has characterized the motion as a further step in the criminal proceedings does <em>not</em> mean that proceedings upon such a motion are of necessity governed by the legal principles which are applicable at a criminal trial regarding such matters as counsel, presence, confrontation, self-incrimination, and burden of proof.</p>
<p class="note-body">The challenge of decisions such as the revocation of probation or parole are not appropriately dealt with under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255, which is a continuation of the original criminal action. Other remedies, such as habeas corpus, are available in such situations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although rule 1 indicates that these rules apply to a motion for a determination that the judgment was imposed &ldquo;in violation of the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. laws of the United States,&rdquo; the language of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255, it is not the intent of these rules to define or limit what is encompassed within that phrase. See <em>Davis v. United States</em>, 417 U.S. 333 (1974), holding that it is not true &ldquo;that every asserted error of law can be raised on a &sect;2255 motion,&rdquo; and that the appropriate inquiry is &ldquo;whether the claimed error of law was a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,&rsquo; and whether [i]t .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. present[s] exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">For a discussion of the &ldquo;custody&rdquo; requirement and the intended limited scope of this remedy, see advisory committee note to &sect;2254 rule 1.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under these rules the application for relief is in the form of a motion rather than a petition (see rule 1 and advisory committee note). Therefore, there is no requirement that the movant name a respondent. This is consistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. The United States Attorney for the district in which the judgment under attack was entered is the proper party to oppose the motion since the federal government is the movant's adversary of record.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the movant is attacking a federal judgment which will subject him to future custody, he must be in <!-- PDFPage:497 -->present custody (see rule 1 and advisory committee note) as the result of a state or federal governmental action. He need not alter the nature of the motion by trying to include the government officer who presently has official custody of him as a psuedo-respondent, or third-party plaintiff, or other fabrication. The court hearing his motion attacking the future custody can exercise jurisdiction over those having him in present custody without the use of artificial pleading devices.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is presently a split among the courts as to whether a person currently in state custody may use a &sect;2255 motion to obtain relief from a federal judgment under which he will be subjected to custody in the future. Negative, see <em>Newton v. United States</em>, 329 F.Supp. 90 (S.D. Texas 1971); affirmative, see <em>Desmond v. The United States Board of Parole</em>, 397 F.2d 386 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 919 (1968); and <em>Paalino v. United States</em>, 314 F.Supp. 875 (C.D.Cal. 1970). It is intended that these rules settle the matter in favor of the prisoner's being able to file a &sect;2255 motion for relief under those circumstances. The proper district in which to file such a motion is the one in which is situated the court which rendered the sentence under attack.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court may correct an illegal sentence or a sentence imposed in an illegal manner, or may reduce the sentence. This remedy should be used, rather than a motion under these &sect;2255 rules, whenever applicable, but there is some overlap between the two proceedings which has caused the courts difficulty.</p>
<p class="note-body">The movant should not be barred from an appropriate remedy because he has misstyled his motion. See <em>United States v. Morgan</em>, 346 U.S. 502, 505 (1954). The court should construe it as whichever one is proper under the circumstances and decide it on its merits. For a &sect;2255 motion construed as a rule 35 motion, see <em>Heflin v. United States</em>, 358 U.S. 415 (1959); and <em>United States v. Coke</em>, 404 F.2d 836 (2d Cir. 1968). For writ of error coram nobis treated as a rule 35 motion, see <em>Hawkins v. United States</em>, 324 F.Supp. 223 (E.D.Texas, Tyler Division 1971). For a rule 35 motion treated as a &sect;2255 motion, see <em>Moss v. United States</em>, 263 F.2d 615 (5th Cir. 1959); <em>Jones v. United States</em>, 400 F.2d 892 (8th Cir. 1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 991 (1969); and <em>United States v. Brown</em>, 413 F.2d 878 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 947 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">One area of difference between &sect;2255 and rule 35 motions is that for the latter there is no requirement that the movant be &ldquo;in custody.&rdquo; <em>Heflin v. United States</em>, 358 U.S. 415, 418, 422 (1959); <em>Duggins v. United States</em>, 240 F.2d 479, 483 (6th Cir. 1957). Compare with rule 1 and advisory committee note for &sect;2255 motions. The importance of this distinction has decreased since <em>Peyton v. Rowe</em>, 391 U.S. 54 (1968), but it might still make a difference in particular situations.</p>
<p class="note-body">A rule 35 motion is used to attack the sentence imposed, not the basis for the sentence. The court in <em>Gilinsky v. United States</em>, 335 F.2d 914, 916 (9th Cir. 1964), stated, &ldquo;a Rule 35 motion presupposes a valid conviction. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [C]ollateral attack on errors allegedly committed at trial is not permissible under Rule 35.&rdquo; By illustration the court noted at page 917: &ldquo;a Rule 35 proceeding contemplates the correction of a sentence of a court having jurisdiction. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [J]urisdictional defects *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* involve a collateral attack, they must ordinarily be presented under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255.&rdquo; In <em>United States v. Semet</em>, 295 F.Supp. 1084 (E.D. Okla. 1968), the prisoner moved under rule 35 and &sect;2255 to invalidate the sentence he was serving on the grounds of his failure to understand the charge to which he pleaded guilty. The court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">As regards Defendant's Motion under Rule 35, said Motion must be denied as its presupposes a valid conviction of the offense with which he was charged and may be used only to attack the sentence. It may not be used to examine errors occurring prior to the imposition of sentence.</p>

Brown</em>, 413 F.2d at 879.</p>
<p class="note-body">A major difficulty in deciding whether rule 35 or &sect;2255 is the proper remedy is the uncertainty as to what is meant by an &ldquo;illegal sentence.&rdquo; The Supreme Court dealt with this issue in <em>Hill v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 424 (1962). The prisoner brought a &sect;2255 motion to vacate sentence on the ground that he had not been given a Fed.R.Crim. P. 32(a) opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf at the time of sentencing. The majority held this was not an error subject to collateral attack under &sect;2255. The five-member majority considered the motion as one brought pursuant to rule 35, but denied relief, stating:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[T]he narrow function of Rule 35 is to permit correction at any time of an illegal <em>sentence</em>, not to re-examine errors occurring at the trial or other proceedings prior to the imposition of sentence. The sentence in this case was not illegal. The punishment meted out was not in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes, multiple terms were not imposed for the same offense, nor were the terms of the sentence itself legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">368 U.S. at 430</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">The four dissenters felt the majority definition of &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; was too narrow.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[Rule 35] provides for the correction of an &ldquo;illegal sentence&rdquo; without regard to the reasons why that sentence is illegal and contains not a single word to support the Court's conclusion that only a sentence illegal by reason of the punishment it imposes is &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; within the meaning of the Rule. I would have thought that a sentence imposed in an illegal manner&mdash;whether the amount or form of the punishment meted out constitutes an additional violation of law or not&mdash;would be recognized as an &ldquo;illegal sentence&rdquo; under any normal reading of the English language.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">368 U.S. at 431&ndash;432</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">The 1966 amendment of rule 35 added language permitting correction of a sentence imposed in an &ldquo;illegal manner.&rdquo; However, there is a 120-day time limit on a motion to do this, and the added language does not clarify the intent of the rule or its relation to &sect;2255.</p>
<p class="note-body">The courts have been flexible in considering motions under circumstances in which relief might appear to be precluded by <em>Hill v. United States</em>. In <em>Peterson v. United States</em>, 432 F.2d 545 (8th Cir. 1970), the court was confronted with a motion for reduction of sentence by a prisoner claiming to have received a harsher sentence than his codefendants because he stood trial rather than plead guilty. He alleged that this violated his constitutional right to a jury trial. The court ruled that, even though it was past the 120-day time period for a motion to reduce sentence, the claim was still cognizable under rule 35 as a motion to correct an illegal sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The courts have made even greater use of &sect;2255 in these types of situations. In <em>United States v. Lewis</em>, 392 F.2d 440 (4th Cir. 1968), the prisoner moved under &sect;2255 and rule 35 for relief from a sentence he claimed was the result of the judge's misunderstanding of the relevant sentencing law. The court held that he could not get relief under rule 35 because it was past the 120 days for correction of a sentence imposed in an illegal manner and under <em>Hill v. United States</em> it was not an illegal sentence. However, &sect;2255 was applicable because of its &ldquo;otherwise subject to collateral attack&rdquo; language. The flaw was not a mere trial error relating to the finding of guilt, but a rare and unusual error which amounted to &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; embraced in &sect;2255's words &ldquo;collateral attack.&rdquo; See 368 U.S. at 444 for discussion of other cases allowing use of &sect;2255 to attack the sentence itself in similar circumstances, especially where the judge has sentenced out of a misapprehension of the law.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:498 --><p class="note-body">In <em>United States v. McCarthy</em>, 433 F.2d 591, 592 (1st Cir. 1970), the court allowed a prisoner who was past the time limit for a proper rule 35 motion to use &sect;2255 to attack the sentence which he received upon a plea of guilty on the ground that it was induced by an unfulfilled promise of the prosecutor to recommend leniency. The court specifically noted that under &sect;2255 this was a proper collateral attack on the sentence and there was no need to attack the conviction as well.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court in <em>United States v. Malcolm</em>, 432 F.2d 809, 814, 818 (2d Cir. 1970), allowed a prisoner to challenge his sentence under &sect;2255 without attacking the conviction. It held rule 35 inapplicable because the sentence was not illegal on its face, but the manner in which the sentence was imposed raised a question of the denial of due process in the sentencing itself which was cognizable under &sect;2255.</p>
<p class="note-body">The flexible approach taken by the courts in the above cases seems to be the reasonable way to handle these situations in which rule 35 and &sect;2255 appear to overlap. For a further discussion of this problem, see C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure; Criminal &sect;&sect;581&ndash;587 (1969, Supp. 1975).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b). The amendment takes into account 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746, enacted after adoption of the &sect;2255 rules. Section 1746 provides that in lieu of an affidavit an unsworn statement may be given under penalty of perjury in substantially the following form if executed within the United States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: &ldquo;I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).&rdquo; The statute is &ldquo;intended to encompass prisoner litigation,&rdquo; and the statutory alternative is especially appropriate in such cases because a notary might not be readily available. <em>Carter v. Clark</em>, 616 F.2d 228 (5th Cir. 1980). The &sect;2255 forms have been revised accordingly.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 2(b)(5) has been amended by removing the requirement that the motion be signed personally by the moving party. Thus, under the amended rule the motion may be signed by [the] movant personally or by someone acting on behalf of the movant, assuming that the person is authorized to do so, for example, an attorney for the movant. The Committee envisions that the courts would apply third-party, or &ldquo;next-friend,&rdquo; standing analysis in deciding whether the signer was actually authorized to sign the motion on behalf of the movant. <em>See generally Whitmore v. Arkansas</em>, 495 U.S. 149 (1990) (discussion of requisites for &ldquo;next friend&rdquo; standing in habeas petitions). <em>See also</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2242 (application for state habeas corpus relief may be filed by the person who is seeking relief, or by someone acting on behalf of that person).</p>
<p class="note-body">The language in new Rule 2(c) has been changed to reflect that a moving party must substantially follow the standard form, which is appended to the rules, or a form provided by the court. The current rule, Rule 2(c), seems to indicate a preference for the standard &ldquo;national&rdquo; form. Under the amended rule, there is no stated preference. The Committee understood that the current practice in some courts is that if the moving party first files a motion using the national form, that courts may ask the moving party to supplement it with the local form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Current Rule 2(d), which provided for returning an insufficient motion[,] has been deleted. The Committee believed that the approach in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e) was more appropriate for dealing with motions that do not conform to the form requirements of the rule. That Rule provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the moving party suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the motion was deemed insufficient. Now that a one-year statute of limitations applies to motions filed under &sect;2255, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2244(d)(1), the court's dismissal of a motion because it is not in proper form may pose a significant penalty for a moving party, who may not be able to file another motion within the one-year limitations period. Now, under revised Rule 3(b), the clerk is required to file a motion, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with the provisions in revised Rule 2(b). The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective motion and require the moving party to submit a corrected motion that conforms to Rule 2(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. The Committee changed Rule 2(b)(2) to read &ldquo;state the facts&rdquo; rather then [sic] &ldquo;briefly summarize the facts.&rdquo; One commentator had written that the current language may actually mislead the petitioner and is also redundant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 2(b)(4) was also modified to reflect that some motions may be printed using a word processing program.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, Rule 2(b)(5) was changed to emphasize that any person, other than the petitioner, who signs the petition must be authorized to do so.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>

If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">There is no filing fee required of a movant under these rules. This is a change from the practice of charging $15 and is done to recognize specifically the nature <!-- PDFPage:499 -->of a &sect;2255 motion as being a continuation of the criminal case whose judgment is under attack.</p>
<p class="note-body">The long-standing practice of requiring a $15 filing fee has followed from 28 U.S.C. &sect;1914(a) whereby &ldquo;parties instituting any civil action *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* pay a filing fee of $15, except that on an application for a writ of habeas corpus the filing fee shall be $5.&rdquo; This has been held to apply to a proceeding under &sect;2255 despite the rationale that such a proceeding is a motion and thus a continuation of the criminal action. (See note to rule 1.)</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">A motion under Section 2255 is a civil action and the clerk has no choice but to charge a $15.00 filing fee unless by leave of court it is filed in forma pauperis.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>McCune</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 406 F.2d 417, 419 (6th Cir. 1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the motion has been considered to be a new civil action in the nature of habeas corpus for filing purposes, the reduced fee for habeas has been held not applicable. The Tenth Circuit considered the specific issue in <em>Martin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 273 F.2d 775 (10th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 853 (1961), holding that the reduced fee was exclusive to habeas petitions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Counsel for Martin insists that, if a docket fee must be paid, the amount is $5 rather than $15 and bases his contention on the exception contained in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1914 that in habeas corpus the fee is $5. This reads into &sect;1914 language which is not there. While an application under &sect;2255 may afford the same relief as that previously obtainable by habeas corpus, it is not a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A change in &sect;1914 must come from Congress.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">273 F.2d at 778</h4>
<p class="note-body">Although for most situations &sect;2255 is intended to provide to the federal prisoner a remedy equivalent to habeas corpus as used by state prisoners, there is a major distinction between the two. Calling a &sect;2255 request for relief a motion rather than a petition militates toward charging no new filing fee, not an increased one. In the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to suppose that Congress did not mean what it said in making a &sect;2255 action a motion. Therefore, as in other motions filed in a criminal action, there is no requirement of a filing fee. It is appropriate that the present situation of docketing a &sect;2255 motion as a new action and charging a $15 filing fee be remedied by the rule when the whole question of &sect;2255 motions is thoroughly thought through and organized.</p>
<p class="note-body">Even though there is no need to have a forma pauperis affidavit to proceed with the action since there is no requirement of a fee for filing the motion the affidavit remains attached to the form to be supplied potential movants. Most such movants are indigent, and this is a convenient way of getting this into the official record so that the judge may appoint counsel, order the government to pay witness fees, allow docketing of an appeal, and grant any other rights to which an indigent is entitled in the course of a &sect;2255 motion, when appropriate to the particular situation, without the need for an indigency petition and adjudication at such later point in the proceeding. This should result in a streamlining of the process to allow quicker disposition of these motions.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 3 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as indicated below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 3(b) is new and is intended to parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e), which provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the moving party suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the petition was deemed insufficient. That Act, however, added a one-year statute of limitations to motions filed under &sect;2255, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2244(d)(1). Thus, a court's dismissal of a defective motion may pose a significant penalty for a moving party who may not be able to file a corrected motion within the one-year limitation period. The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective motion and require the moving party to submit a corrected motion that conforms to Rule 2. Thus, revised Rule 3(b) requires the clerk to file a motion, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with Rule 2.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 3(c), which sets out a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255, paragraph 6, is new and has been added to put moving parties on notice that a one-year statute of limitations applies to motions filed under these Rules. Although the rule does not address the issue, every circuit that has addressed the issue has taken the position that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is available in appropriate circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Dunlap v. United States</em>, 250 F.3d 1001, 1004&ndash;07 (6th Cir. 2001); <em>Moore v. United States</em>, 173 F.3d 1131, 1133&ndash;35 (8th Cir. 1999); <em>Sandvik v. United States</em>, 177 F.3d 1269, 1270&ndash;72 (11th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court has not addressed the question directly. <em>See Duncan v. Walker</em>, 533 U.S. 167, 181 (2001) (&ldquo;We .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have no occasion to address the question that Justice Stevens raises concerning the availability of equitable tolling.&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 3(d) is new and provides guidance on determining whether a motion from an inmate is considered to have been filed in a timely fashion. The new provision parallels Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. The Committee modified the Committee Note to reflect that the clerk must file a motion, even in those instances where the necessary filing fee or in forma pauperis form is not attached. The Note also includes new language concerning the equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 4. Preliminary Review</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Referral to a Judge</cap-smallcap>. The clerk must promptly forward the motion to the judge who conducted the trial and imposed sentence or, if the judge who imposed sentence was not the trial judge, to the judge who conducted the proceedings being challenged. If the appropriate judge is not available, the clerk must forward the motion to a judge under the court's assignment procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Initial Consideration by the Judge</cap-smallcap>. The judge who receives the motion must promptly examine it. If it plainly appears from the motion, any attached exhibits, and the record of prior proceedings that the moving party is not entitled to relief, the judge must dismiss the motion and direct the clerk to notify the moving party. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge must order the United States attorney to file an answer, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take other action the judge may order.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4 outlines the procedure for assigning the motion to a specific judge of the district court and the options available to the judge and the government after the motion is properly filed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The long-standing majority practice in assigning motions made pursuant to &sect;2255 has been for the trial judge to determine the merits of the motion. In cases <!-- PDFPage:500 -->where the &sect;2255 motion is directed against the sentence, the merits have traditionally been decided by the judge who imposed sentence. The reasoning for this was first noted in <em>Currell v. United States</em>, 173 F.2d 348, 348&ndash;349 (4th Cir. 1949):</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Complaint is made that the judge who tried the case passed upon the motion. Not only was there no impropriety in this, but it is highly desirable in such cases that the motions be passed on by the judge who is familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding the trial, and is consequently not likely to be misled by false allegations as to what occurred.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">This case, and its reasoning, has been almost unanimously endorsed by other courts dealing with the issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">Commentators have been critical of having the motion decided by the trial judge. See Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1206&ndash;1208 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[T]he trial judge may have become so involved with the decision that it will be difficult for him to review it objectively. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that &ldquo;court&rdquo; refers to a specific judge, and the procedural advantages of section 2255 are available whether or not the trial judge presides at the hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The theory that Congress intended the trial judge to preside at a section 2255 hearing apparently originated in <em>Carvell v. United States</em>, 173 F.2d 348 (4th Cir. 1949) (per curiam), where the panel of judges included Chief Judge Parker of the Fourth Circuit, chairman of the Judicial Conference committee which drafted section 2255. But the legislative history does not indicate that Congress wanted the trial judge to preside. Indeed the advantages of section 2255 can all be achieved if the case is heard in the sentencing district, regardless of which judge hears it. According to the Senate committee report the purpose of the bill was to make the proceeding a part of the criminal action so the court could resentence the applicant, or grant him a new trial. (A judge presiding over a habeas corpus action does not have these powers.) In addition, Congress did not want the cases heard in the district of confinement because that tended to concentrate the burden on a few districts, and made it difficult for witnesses and records to be produced.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">83 Harv.L.Rev. at 1207&ndash;1208</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held that a judge other than the trial judge should rule on the 2255 motion. See <em>Halliday v. United States</em>, 380 F.2d 270 (1st Cir. 1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">There is a procedure by which the movant can have a judge other than the trial judge decide his motion in courts adhering to the majority rule. He can file an affidavit alleging bias in order to disqualify the trial judge. And there are circumstances in which the trial judge will, on his own, disqualify himself. See, <em>e.g., Webster v. United States</em>, 330 F.Supp. 1080 (1972). However, there has been some questioning of the effectiveness of this procedure. See Developments in the Law&mdash;Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1200&ndash;1207 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) adopts the majority rule and provides that the trial judge, or sentencing judge if different and appropriate for the particular motion, will decide the motion made pursuant to these rules, recognizing that, under some circumstances, he may want to disqualify himself. A movant is not without remedy if he feels this is unfair to him. He can file an affidavit of bias. And there is the right to appellate review if the trial judge refuses to grant his motion. Because the trial judge is thoroughly familiar with the case, there is obvious administrative advantage in giving him the first opportunity to decide whether there are grounds for granting the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the motion is part of the criminal action in which was entered the judgment to which it is directed, the files, records, transcripts, and correspondence relating to that judgment are automatically available to the judge in his consideration of the motion. He no longer need order them incorporated for that purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4 has its basis in &sect;2255 (rather than 28 U.S.C. &sect;2243 in the corresponding habeas corpus rule) which does not have a specific time limitation as to when the answer must be made. Also, under &sect;2255, the United States Attorney for the district is the party served with the notice and a copy of the motion and required to answer (when appropriate). Subdivision (b) continues this practice since there is no respondent involved in the motion (unlike habeas) and the United States Attorney, as prosecutor in the case in question, is the most appropriate one to defend the judgment and oppose the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The judge has discretion to require an answer or other appropriate response from the United States Attorney. See advisory committee note to rule 4 of the &sect;2254 rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Unlike the habeas corpus statutes (see 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2243, 2248) &sect;2255 does not specifically call for a return or answer by the United States Attorney or set any time limits as to when one must be submitted. The general practice, however, if the motion is not summarily dismissed, is for the government to file an answer to the motion as well as counter-affidavits, when appropriate. Rule 4 provides for an answer to the motion by the United States Attorney, and rule 5 indicates what its contents should be.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is no requirement that the movant exhaust his remedies prior to seeking relief under &sect;2255. However, the courts have held that such a motion is inappropriate if the movant is simultaneously appealing the decision.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">We are of the view that there is no jurisdictional bar to the District Court's entertaining a Section 2255 <!-- PDFPage:501 -->motion during the pendency of a direct appeal but that the orderly administration of criminal law precludes considering such a motion absent extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p class="note-body">There is nothing in &sect;2255 which corresponds to the &sect;2248 requirement of a traverse to the answer. Numerous cases have held that the government's answer and affidavits are not conclusive against the movant, and if they raise disputed issues of fact a hearing must be held. <em>Machibroda v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 487, 494, 495 (1962); <em>United States v. Salerno</em>, 290 F.2d 105, 106 (2d Cir. 1961); <em>Romero v. United States</em>, 327 F.2d 711, 712 (5th Cir. 1964); <em>Scott v. United States</em>, 349 F.2d 641, 642, 643 (6th Cir. 1965); <em>Schiebelhut v. United States</em>, 357 F.2d 743, 745 (6th Cir. 1966); and <em>Del Piano v. United States</em>, 362 F.2d 931, 932, 933 (3d Cir. 1966). None of these cases make any mention of a traverse by the movant to the government's answer. As under rule 5 of the &sect;2254 rules, there is no intention here that such a traverse be required, except under special circumstances. See advisory committee note to rule 9.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) provides for the government to supplement its answers with appropriate copies of transcripts or briefs if for some reason the judge does not already have them under his control. This is because the government will in all probability have easier access to such papers than the movant, and it will conserve the court's time to have the government produce them rather than the movant, who would in most instances have to apply in forma pauperis for the government to supply them for him anyway.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 5(a), which provides that the respondent is not required to file an answer to the motion, unless a judge so orders, is taken from current Rule 3(b). The revised rule does not address the practice in some districts, where the respondent files a pre-answer motion to dismiss the motion. But revised Rule 4(b) contemplates that practice and has been changed to reflect the view that if the court does not dismiss the motion, it may require (or permit) the respondent to file a motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, revised Rule 5(d) adopts the practice in some jurisdictions giving the movant an opportunity to file a reply to the respondent's answer. Rather than using terms such as &ldquo;traverse,&rdquo; <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2248, to identify the movant's response to the answer, the rule uses the more general term &ldquo;reply.&rdquo; The Rule prescribes that the court set the time for such responses, and in lieu of setting specific time limits in each case, the court may decide to include such time limits in its local rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. Rule 5(a) was modified to read that the government is not required to &ldquo;respond&rdquo; to the motion unless the court so orders; the term &ldquo;respond&rdquo; was used because it leaves open the possibility that the government's first response (as it is in some districts) is in the form of a pre-answer motion to dismiss the petition. The Note has been changed to reflect the fact that although the rule itself does not reflect that particular motion, it is used in some districts and refers the reader to Rule 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the Committee changed the Note to address the use of the term &ldquo;traverse,&rdquo; a point raised by one of the commentators on the proposed rule.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 6. Discovery</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Leave of Court Required</cap-smallcap>. A judge may, for good cause, authorize a party to conduct discovery under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or Civil Procedure, or in accordance with the practices and principles of law.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Requesting Discovery</cap-smallcap>. A party requesting discovery must provide reasons for the request. The request must also include any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Deposition Expenses</cap-smallcap>. If the government is granted leave to take a deposition, the judge may require the government to pay the travel expenses, subsistence expenses, and fees of the moving party's attorney to attend the deposition.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule differs from the corresponding discovery rule under the &sect;2254 rules in that it includes the processes of discovery available under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as well as the civil.

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">It is less likely that the court will feel the need to expand the record in a &sect;2255 proceeding than in a habeas corpus proceeding, because the trial (or sentencing) judge is the one hearing the motion (see rule 4) and should already have a complete file on the case in his possession. However, rule 7 provides a convenient method for supplementing his file if the case warrants it.</p>

<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 7(a) is not intended to restrict the court's authority to expand the record through means other than requiring the parties themselves to provide the information.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. Rule 7(a) was changed by removing the reference to the &ldquo;merits&rdquo; of the motion. One commentator had stated that the court may wish to expand the record for purposes other than the merits of the case.

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Rule 8. Evidentiary Hearing</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Determining Whether to Hold a Hearing</cap-smallcap>. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge must review the answer, any transcripts and records of prior proceedings, and any materials submitted under Rule 7 to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reference to a Magistrate Judge</cap-smallcap>. A judge may, under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b), refer the motion to a magistrate judge to conduct hearings and to file proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition. When they are filed, the clerk must promptly serve copies of the proposed findings and recommendations on all parties. Within 10 days after being served, a party may file objections as provided by local court rule. The judge must determine de novo any proposed finding or recommendation to which objection is made. The judge may accept, reject, or modify any proposed finding or recommendation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appointing Counsel; Time of Hearing</cap-smallcap>. If an evidentiary hearing is warranted, the judge must appoint an attorney to represent a moving party who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A.

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The standards for &sect;2255 hearings are essentially the same as for evidentiary hearings under a habeas petition, except that the previous federal fact-finding proceeding is in issue rather than the state's. Also &sect;2255 does not set specific time limits for holding the hearing, as does &sect;2243 for a habeas action. With these minor differences in mind, see the advisory committee note to rule 8 of &sect;2254 rules, which is applicable to rule 8 of these &sect;2255 rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 8 is one of a series of parallel amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 32, 32.1, and 46 which extend the scope of Rule 26.2 (Production of Witness Statements) to proceedings other than the trial itself. The amendments are grounded on the compelling need for accurate and credible information in making decisions concerning the defendant's liberty. <em>See</em> the Advisory Committee Note to Rule 26.2(g). A few courts have recognized the authority of a judicial officer to order production of prior statements by a witness at a Section 2255 hearing, <em>see, e.g., United States v. White</em>, 342 F.2d 379, 382, n.4 (4th Cir. 1959). The amendment to Rule 8 grants explicit authority to do so. The amendment is not intended to require production of a witness's statement before the witness actually presents oral testimony.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Unlike the statutory provisions on habeas corpus (28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2241&ndash;2254), &sect;2255 specifically provides that &ldquo;a motion for such relief may be made <em>at any time.&rdquo;</em> [Emphasis added.] Subdivision (a) provides that delayed motions may be barred from consideration if the government has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the motion by the delay and the movant's failure to seek relief earlier is not excusable within the terms of the rule. Case law, dealing with this issue, is in conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some courts have held that the literal language of &sect;2255 precludes any possible time bar to a motion brought under it. In <em>Heflin v. United States</em>, 358 U.S. 415 (1959), the concurring opinion noted:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">The statute [28 U.S.C. &sect;2255] further provides; &ldquo;A motion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may be made at any time.&rdquo; This *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* simply means that, as in habeas corpus, there is no statute of limitations, no <em>res judicata</em>, and that the doctrine of laches is inapplicable.</p>

<p class="note-body-block"><em>McKinney v. United States</em>, 208 F.2d 844 (D.C.Cir. 1953) reversed the district court's dismissal of a &sect;2255 motion for being too late, the court stating:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">McKinney's present application for relief comes late in the day: he has served some fifteen years in prison. But tardiness is irrelevant where a constitutional issue is raised and where the prisoner is still confined.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">208 F.2d at 846, 847</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">In accord, see: <em>Juelich v. United States</em>, 300 F.2d 381, 383 (5th Cir. 1962); <em>Conners v. United States</em>, 431 F.2d 1207, 1208 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Sturrup v.

<p class="note-body">It has also been held that delay in filing a &sect;2255 motion does not bar the movant because of lack of reasonable diligence in pressing the claim.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">The statute [28 U.S.C. &sect;2255], when it states that the motion may be made at any time, excludes the addition of a showing of diligence in delayed filings. A number of courts have considered contentions similar to those made here and have concluded that there are no time limitations. This result excludes the requirement of diligence which is in reality a time limitation.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Haier v. United States</em>, 334 F.2d 441, 442 (10th Cir. 1964)</h4>
<p class="note-body">Other courts have recognized that delay may have a negative effect on the movant. In <em>Raines v. United States</em>, 423 F.2d 526 (4th Cir. 1970), the court stated:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[B]oth petitioners&rsquo; silence for extended periods, one for 28 months and the other for nine years, serves to render their allegations less believable. &ldquo;Although a delay in filing a section 2255 motion is not a controlling element *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* it may merit some consideration *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">423 F.2d at 531</h4>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Aiken v. United States</em>, 191 F.Supp. 43, 50 (M.D.N.Car. 1961), aff'd 296 F.2d 604 (4th Cir. 1961), the court said: &ldquo;While motions under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 may be made at any time, the lapse of time affects the good faith and credibility of the moving party.&rdquo; For similar conclusions, see: <em>Parker v. United States</em>, 358 F.2d 50, 54 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 916 (1967); <em>Le Clair v. United States</em>, 241 F.Supp. 819, 824 (N.D. Ind. 1965); <em>Malone v.

Wiggins</em>, 184 F. Supp. 673, 676 (D.C.Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">There have been holdings by some courts that a delay in filing a &sect;2255 motion operates to increase the burden of proof which the movant must meet to obtain relief. The reasons for this, as expressed in <em>United States v. Bostic</em>, 206 F.Supp. 855 (D.C.Cir. 1962), are equitable in nature.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Obviously, the burden of proof on a motion to vacate a sentence under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 is on the moving party. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The burden is particularly heavy if the issue is one of fact and a long time has elapsed since the trial of the case. While neither the statute of limitations nor laches can bar the assertion of a constitutional right, nevertheless, the passage of time may make it impracticable to retry a case if the motion is granted and a new trial is ordered. No doubt, at times such a motion is a product of an afterthought. Long delay may raise a question of good faith.</p>

<p class="note-body-block">See also <em>United States v. Wiggins</em>, 184 F.Supp. at 676.</p>
<p class="note-body">A requirement that the movant display reasonable diligence in filing a &sect;2255 motion has been adopted by some courts dealing with delayed motions. The court in <em>United States v. Moore</em>, 166 F.2d 102 (7th Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 334 U.S. 849 (1948), did this, again for equitable reasons.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">[W]e agree with the District Court that the petitioner has too long slept upon his rights. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [A]pparently there is no limitation of time within which *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a motion to vacate may be filed, except that an applicant must show reasonable diligence in presenting his claim. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The reasons which support the rule requiring diligence seem obvious. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Law enforcement officials change, witnesses die, memories grow dim. The prosecuting tribunal is put to a disadvantage if an unexpected retrial should be necessary after long passage of time.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">166 F.2d at 105</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">In accord see <em>Desmond v. United States</em>, 333 F.2d 378, 381 (1st Cir. 1964), on remand, 345 F.2d 225 (1st Cir. 1965).</p>
<p class="note-body">One of the major arguments advanced by the courts which would penalize a movant who waits an unduly long time before filing a &sect;2255 motion is that such delay is highly prejudicial to the prosecution. In <em>Desmond v. United States</em>, writing of a &sect;2255 motion alleging denial of effective appeal because of deception by movant's own counsel, the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">[A]pplications for relief such as this must be made promptly. It will not do for a prisoner to wait until government witnesses have become unavailable as by death, serious illness or absence from the country, or until the memory of available government witnesses has faded. It will not even do for a prisoner to wait any longer than is reasonably necessary to prepare appropriate moving papers, however inartistic, after discovery of the deception practiced upon him by his attorney.</p>

<p class="note-body-block">In a similar vein are <em>United States v. Moore</em> and <em>United States v. Bostic</em>, supra, and <em>United States v. Wiggins</em>, 184 F. Supp. at 676.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) provides a flexible, equitable time limitation based on laches to prevent movants from withholding their claims so as to prejudice the government both in meeting the allegations of the motion and in any possible retrial. It includes a reasonable diligence requirement for ascertaining possible grounds for relief. If the delay is found to be excusable, or nonprejudicial to the government, the time bar is inoperative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is consistent with the language of &sect;2255 and relevant case law.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 11 is intended to make clear that, although a &sect;2255 action is a continuation of the criminal case, the bringing of a &sect;2255 action does not extend the time.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Prior to the promulgation of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, the courts consistently held that the time for appeal in a section 2255 case is as provided in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a), that is, 60 days when the government is a party, rather than as provided in appellate rule 4(b), which says that the time is 10 days in criminal cases. This result has often been explained on the ground that rule 4(a) has to do with civil cases and that &ldquo;proceedings under section 2255 are civil in nature.&rdquo; E.g., <em>Rothman v. United States</em>, 508 F.2d 648 (3d Cir. 1975). Because the new section 2255 rules are based upon the premise &ldquo;that a motion under &sect;2255 is a further step in the movant's criminal case rather than a separate civil action,&rdquo; see Advisory Committee Note to rule 1, the question has arisen whether the new rules have the effect of shortening the time for appeal to that provided in appellate rule 4(b). A sentence has been added to rule 11 in order to make it clear that this is not the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Even though section 2255 proceedings are a further step in the criminal case, the added sentence correctly states current law. In <em>United States v. Hayman</em>, 342 U.S. 205 (1952), the Supreme Court noted that such appeals &ldquo;are governed by the civil rules applicable to appeals from final judgments in habeas corpus actions.&rdquo; In support, the Court cited <em>Mercado v. United States</em>, 183 F.2d 486 (1st Cir. 1950), a case rejecting the argument that because &sect;2255 proceedings are criminal in nature the time for appeal is only 10 days. The <em>Mercado</em> court concluded that the situation was governed by that part of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 which reads: &ldquo;An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.&rdquo; Thus, because appellate rule 4(a) is applicable in habeas cases, it likewise governs in &sect;2255 cases even though they are criminal in nature.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Advisory Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule differs from rule 11 of the &sect;2254 rules in that it includes the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as well as the civil. This is because of the nature of a &sect;2255 motion as a continuing part of the criminal proceeding (see advisory committee note to rule 1) as well as a remedy analogous to habeas corpus by state prisoners.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since &sect;2255 has been considered analogous to habeas as respects the restrictions in Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(2) (see <em>Sullivan v. United States</em>, 198 F.Supp. 624 (S.D.N.Y. 1961)), rule 12 is needed. For discussion, see the advisory committee note to rule 11 of the &sect;2254 rules.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) This chapter shall apply to cases arising under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence. It shall apply only if the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) are satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) This chapter is applicable if a State establishes by statute, rule of its court of last resort, or by another agency authorized by State law, a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes. The rule of court or statute must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and reimbursement of counsel as provided in subsection (b) must offer counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must provide for the entry of an order by a court of record&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appointing one or more counsels to represent the prisoner upon a finding that the prisoner is indigent and accepted the offer or is unable competently to decide whether to accept or reject the offer;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) No counsel appointed pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) to represent a State prisoner under capital sentence shall have previously represented the prisoner at trial or on direct appeal in the case for which the appointment is made unless the prisoner and counsel expressly request continued representation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during State or Federal post-conviction proceedings in a capital case shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section 2254. This limitation shall not preclude the appointment of different counsel, on the court's own motion or at the request of the prisoner, at any phase of State or Federal post-conviction proceedings on the basis of the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel in such proceedings.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For purposes of this section, a &ldquo;unitary review&rdquo; procedure means a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence of death to raise, in the course of direct review of the judgment, such claims as could be raised on collateral attack. This chapter shall apply, as provided in this section, in relation to a State unitary review procedure if the State establishes by rule of its court of last resort or by statute a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in the unitary review proceedings, including expenses relating to the litigation of collateral claims in the proceedings. The rule of court or statute must provide standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) To qualify under this section, a unitary review procedure must include an offer of counsel following trial for the purpose of representation on unitary review, and entry of an order, as provided in section 2261(c), concerning appointment of counsel or waiver or denial of appointment of counsel for that purpose. No counsel appointed to represent the prisoner in the unitary review proceedings shall have previously represented the prisoner at trial in the case for which the appointment is made unless the prisoner and counsel expressly request continued representation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Sections 2262, 2263, 2264, and 2266 shall apply in relation to cases involving a sentence of death from any State having a unitary review procedure that qualifies under this section. References to State &ldquo;post-conviction review&rdquo; and &ldquo;direct review&rdquo; in such sections shall be understood as referring to unitary review under the State procedure. The reference in section 2262(a) to &ldquo;an order under section 2261(c)&rdquo; shall be understood as referring to the post-trial order under subsection (b) concerning representation in the unitary review proceedings, but if a transcript of the trial proceedings is unavailable at the time of the filing of such an order in the appropriate State court, then the start of the 180-day limitation period under section 2263 shall be deferred until a transcript is made available to the prisoner or counsel of the prisoner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The adjudication of any application under section 2254 that is subject to this chapter, and the adjudication of any motion under section 2255 by a person under sentence of death, shall be given priority by the district court and by the court of appeals over all noncapital matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) A district court shall render a final determination and enter a final judgment on any application for a writ of habeas corpus brought under this chapter in a capital case not later than 180 days after the date on which the application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A district court shall afford the parties at least 120 days in which to complete all actions, including the preparation of all pleadings and briefs, and if necessary, a hearing, prior to the submission of the case for decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A district court may delay for not more than one additional 30-day period beyond the period specified in subparagraph (A), the rendering of a determination of an application for a writ of habeas corpus if the court issues a written order making a finding, and stating the reasons for the finding, that the ends of justice that would be served by allowing the delay outweigh the best interests of the public and the applicant in a speedy disposition of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The factors, among others, that a court shall consider in determining whether a delay in the disposition of an application is warranted are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) Whether the failure to allow the delay would be likely to result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of defendants, the nature of the prosecution, or the existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate briefing within the time limitations established by subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) Whether the failure to allow a delay in a case that, taken as a whole, is not so unusual or so complex as described in subclause (II), but would otherwise deny the applicant reasonable time to obtain counsel, would unreasonably deny the applicant or the government continuity of counsel, or would deny counsel for the applicant or the government the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) No delay in disposition shall be permissible because of general congestion of the court's calendar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The court shall transmit a copy of any order issued under clause (i) to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for inclusion in the report under paragraph (5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any redetermination of an application for a writ of habeas corpus following a remand by the court of appeals or the Supreme Court for further proceedings, in which case the limitation period shall run from the date the remand is ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The time limitations under this section shall not be construed to entitle an applicant to a stay of execution, to which the applicant would otherwise not be entitled, for the purpose of litigating any application or appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No amendment to an application for a writ of habeas corpus under this chapter shall be permitted after the filing of the answer to the application, except on the grounds specified in section 2244(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The failure of a court to meet or comply with a time limitation under this section shall not be a ground for granting relief from a judgment of conviction or sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The State may enforce a time limitation under this section by petitioning for a writ of mandamus to the court of appeals. The court of appeals shall act on the petition for a writ of mandamus not later than 30 days after the filing of the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall submit to Congress an annual report on the compliance by the district courts with the time limitations under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The report described in subparagraph (A) shall include copies of the orders submitted by the district courts under paragraph (1)(B)(iv).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1)(A) A court of appeals shall hear and render a final determination of any appeal of an order granting or denying, in whole or in part, an application brought under this chapter in a capital case not later than 120 days after the date on which the reply brief is filed, or if no reply brief is filed, not later than 120 days after the date on which the answering brief is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A court of appeals shall decide whether to grant a petition for rehearing or other request for rehearing en banc not later than 30 days after the date on which the petition for rehearing is filed unless a responsive pleading is required, in which case the court shall decide whether to grant the petition not later than 30 days after the date on which the responsive pleading is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc is granted, the court of appeals shall hear and render a final determination of the appeal not later than 120 days after the date on which the order granting rehearing or rehearing en banc is entered.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;379 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;265, 36 Stat. 1162).</p>
<p class="note-body">An exception as to acts of Congress relating to bankruptcy was omitted and the general exception substituted to cover all exceptions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;in aid of its jurisdiction&rdquo; was added to conform to section 1651 of this title and to make clear the recognized power of the Federal courts to stay proceedings in State cases removed to the district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exceptions specifically include the words &ldquo;to protect or &ldquo;effectuate its judgments,&rdquo; for lack of which the Supreme Court held that the Federal courts are without power to enjoin relitigation of cases and controversies fully adjudicated by such courts. (See <em>Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Co</em>., 62 S.Ct. 139, 314 U.S. 118, 86 L.Ed. 100. A vigorous dissenting opinion (62 S.Ct. 148) notes that at the time of the 1911 revision of the Judicial Code, the power of the courts, of the United States to protect their judgments was unquestioned and that the revisers of that code noted no change and Congress intended no change).</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore the revised section restores the basic law as generally understood and interpreted prior to the Toucey decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) In any action required to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges under subsection (a) of this section, the composition and procedure of the court shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a request for three judges, the judge to whom the request is presented shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges, at least one of whom shall be a circuit judge.

A single judge shall not appoint a master, or order a reference, or hear and determine any application for a preliminary or permanent injunction or motion to vacate such an injunction, or enter judgment on the merits. Any action of a single judge may be reviewed by the full court at any time before final judgment.</p>

<p class="note-body">Provisions of sections 47, 47a, 380, and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction of direct appeals appear in section 1253 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of sections 47, 380, and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring applications for injunctions restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of Federal or State statutes or orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission to be heard and determined by three-judge district courts appear in sections 2281, 2282, and 2325 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision for notice to the United States attorney for the district where the action is pending was added because of the necessity of the United States attorney's preparation for hearing as soon as possible, to expedite such a case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of sections 47, 47a, 380, and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respecting time for direct appeal appear in section 2101 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">This revised section represents an effort to provide a uniform method of convoking three-judge district courts, and for procedure therein. It follows recommendations of a committee appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, composed of Circuit Judges Evan A. Evans, Kimbrough Stone, Orie L. Phillips, and Albert B. Maris.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee pointed out that section 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is the latest and &ldquo;most carefully drawn expression by Congress on the subject.&rdquo; Consequently, this section follows closely such section 380a and eliminates the discrepancies between sections 47, 47a, 380, and 380a of such title.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section governs only the composition and procedure of three-judge district courts. The requirement that applications for injunctions be heard and determined by such courts will appear in other sections of this and other titles of the United States Code as Congress may enact from time to time. For example, see sections 2281, 2282, and 2325 of this title, sections 1213, 1215, 1255 of title 11, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Bankruptcy, section 28 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 44 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">United States District Judge W. Calvin Chestnut, has referred to the provisions relating to enforcement or setting aside or orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission as unfortunately lengthy and prolix. He has urged revision to insure uniform procedure in the several classes of so-called three-judge cases.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The court of appeals has jurisdiction of the proceeding on the filing and service of a petition to review. The court of appeals in which the record on review is filed, on the filing, has jurisdiction to vacate stay orders or interlocutory injunctions previously granted by any court, and has exclusive jurisdiction to make and enter, on the petition, evidence, and proceedings set forth in the record on review, a judgment determining the validity of, and enjoining, setting aside, or suspending, in whole or in part, the order of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The filing of the petition to review does not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the agency, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition. When the petitioner makes application for an interlocutory injunction restraining or suspending the enforcement, operation, or execution of, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any order reviewable under this chapter, at least 5 days&rsquo; notice of the hearing thereon shall be given to the agency and to the Attorney General. In a case in which irreparable damage would otherwise result to the petitioner, the court of appeals may, on hearing, after reasonable notice to the agency and to the Attorney General, order a temporary stay or suspension, in whole or in part, of the operation of the order of the agency for not more than 60 days from the date of the order pending the hearing on the application for the interlocutory injunction, in which case the order of the court of appeals shall contain a specific finding, based on evidence submitted to the court of appeals, and identified by reference thereto, that irreparable damage would result to the petitioner and specifying the nature of the damage. The court of appeals, at the time of hearing the application for an interlocutory injunction, on a like finding, may continue the temporary stay or suspension, in whole or in part, until decision on the application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The United States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest, other than a security interest or water rights. This section does not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands, nor does it apply to or affect actions which may be or could have been brought under sections 1346, 1347, 1491, or 2410 of this title, sections 7424, 7425, or 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 7424, 7425, and 7426), or section 208 of the Act of July 10, 1952 (43 U.S.C. 666).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The United States shall not be disturbed in possession or control of any real property involved in any action under this section pending a final judgment or decree, the conclusion of any appeal therefrom, and sixty days; and if the final determination shall be adverse to the United States, the United States nevertheless may retain such possession or control of the real property or of any part thereof as it may elect, upon payment to the person determined to be entitled thereto of an amount which upon such election the district court in the same action shall determine to be just compensation for such possession or control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No preliminary injunction shall issue in any action brought under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The complaint shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff claims in the real property, the circumstances under which it was acquired, and the right, title, or interest claimed by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the United States disclaims all interest in the real property or interest therein adverse to the plaintiff at any time prior to the actual commencement of the trial, which disclaimer is confirmed by order of the court, the jurisdiction of the district court shall cease unless it has jurisdiction of the civil action or suit on ground other than and independent of the authority conferred by section 1346(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A civil action against the United States under this section shall be tried by the court without a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any civil action under this section, except for an action brought by a State, shall be barred unless it is commenced within twelve years of the date upon which it accrued. Such action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) No civil action may be maintained under this section by a State with respect to defense facilities (including land) of the United States so long as the lands at issue are being used or required by the United States for national defense purposes as determined by the head of the Federal agency with jurisdiction over the lands involved, if it is determined that the State action was brought more than twelve years after the State knew or should have known of the claims of the United States. Upon cessation of such use or requirement, the State may dispute title to such lands pursuant to the provisions of this section. The decision of the head of the Federal agency is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Any civil action brought by a State under this section with respect to lands, other than tide or submerged lands, on which the United States or its lessee or right-of-way or easement grantee has made substantial improvements or substantial investments or on which the United <!-- PDFPage:536 -->States has conducted substantial activities pursuant to a management plan such as range improvement, timber harvest, tree planting, mineral activities, farming, wildlife habitat improvement, or other similar activities, shall be barred unless the action is commenced within twelve years after the date the State received notice of the Federal claims to the lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) If a final determination in an action brought by a State under this section involving submerged or tide lands on which the United States or its lessee or right-of-way or easement grantee has made substantial improvements or substantial investments is adverse to the United States and it is determined that the State's action was brought more than twelve years after the State received notice of the Federal claim to the lands, the State shall take title to the lands subject to any existing lease, easement, or right-of-way. Any compensation due with respect to such lease, easement, or right-of-way shall be determined under existing law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Notice for the purposes of the accrual of an action brought by a State under this section shall be&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;tide or submerged lands&rdquo; means &ldquo;lands beneath navigable waters&rdquo; as defined in section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) Not less than one hundred and eighty days before bringing any action under this section, a State shall notify the head of the Federal agency with jurisdiction over the lands in question of the State's intention to file suit, the basis therefor, and a description of the lands included in the suit.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under the conditions prescribed in this section and section 1444 of this title for the protection of the United States, the United States may be named a party in any civil action or suit in any district court, or in any State court having jurisdiction of the subject matter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to quiet title to,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to foreclose a mortgage or other lien upon,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to partition,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to condemn, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader with respect to,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">real or personal property on which the United States has or claims a mortgage or other lien.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The complaint or pleading shall set forth with particularity the nature of the interest or lien of the United States. In actions or suits involving liens arising under the internal revenue laws, the complaint or pleading shall include the name and address of the taxpayer whose liability created the lien and, if a notice of the tax lien was filed, the identity of the internal revenue office which filed the notice, and the date and place such notice of lien was filed. In actions in the State courts service upon the United States shall be made by serving the process of the court with a copy of the complaint upon the United States attorney for the district in which the action is brought or upon an assistant United States attorney or clerical employee designated by the United States attorney in writing filed with the clerk of the court in which the action is brought and by sending copies of the process and complaint, by registered mail, or by certified mail, to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, District of Columbia. In such actions the United States may appear and answer, plead or demur within sixty days after such service or such further time as the court may allow.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A judgment or decree in such action or suit shall have the same effect respecting the discharge of the property from the mortgage or other lien held by the United States as may be provided with respect to such matters by the local law of the place where the court is situated. However, an action to foreclose a mortgage or other lien, naming the United States as a party under this section, must seek judicial sale. A sale to satisfy a lien inferior to one of the United States shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien of the United States, unless the United States consents that the property may be sold free of its lien and the proceeds divided as the parties may be entitled. Where a sale of real estate is made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States, the United States shall have one year from the date of sale within which to redeem, except that with respect to a lien arising under the internal revenue laws the period shall be 120 days or the period allowable for redemption under State law, whichever is longer, and in any case in which, under the provisions of section 505 of the Housing Act of 1950, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1701k), and subsection (d) of section 3720 of title 38 of the United States Code, the right to redeem does not arise, there shall be no right of redemption. In any case where the debt owing the United States is due, the United States may ask, by way of affirmative relief, for the foreclosure of its own lien and where property is sold to satisfy a first lien held <!-- PDFPage:537 -->by the United States, the United States may bid at the sale such sum, not exceeding the amount of its claim with expenses of sale, as may be directed by the head (or his delegate) of the department or agency of the United States which has charge of the administration of the laws in respect to which the claim of the United States arises. In any case where the United States is a bidder at the judicial sale, it may credit the amount determined to be due it against the amount it bids at such sales.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any case in which the United States redeems real property under this section or section 7425 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the amount to be paid for such property shall be the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the actual amount paid by the purchaser at such sale (which, in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent satisfied by reason of such sale),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) interest on the amount paid (as determined under paragraph (1)) at 6 percent per annum from the date of such sale, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount (if any) equal to the excess of (A) the expenses necessarily incurred in connection with such property, over (B) the income from such property plus (to the extent such property is used by the purchaser) a reasonable rental value of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Whenever any person has a lien upon any real or personal property, duly recorded in the jurisdiction in which the property is located, and a junior lien, other than a tax lien, in favor of the United States attaches to such property, such person may make a written request to the officer charged with the administration of the laws in respect of which the lien of the United States arises, to have the same extinguished. If after appropriate investigation, it appears to such officer that the proceeds from the sale of the property would be insufficient to wholly or partly satisfy the lien of the United States, or that the claim of the United States has been satisfied or by lapse of time or otherwise has become unenforceable, such officer may issue a certificate releasing the property from such lien.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 765 with provisions of sections 931(a) and 932, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to interest on judgments, the latter two sections being applicable to judgments in tort claims cases. For other provisions of said sections 931(a) and 932, see Distribution Table. Said section 932 made the provisions of said section 765 applicable to such judgments, therefore the provisions of said section 931(a) that &ldquo;the United States shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment&rdquo; was omitted as covered by the language of said section 765 providing that interest shall be computed from the date of the judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 765 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that when the findings of fact and the law applicable thereto have been filed in any case as provided in &ldquo;section 763&rdquo; [764] of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the judgment or decree is adverse to the Government, it shall be the duty of the district attorney to transmit to the Attorney General of the United States certified copies of all the papers filed in the cause, with a transcript of the testimony taken, the written findings of the court, and his written opinion as to the same, that, whereupon, the Attorney General shall determine and direct whether an appeal shall be taken or not, and that, when so directed, the district attorney shall cause an appeal to be perfected in accordance with the terms of the statutes and rules of practice governing the same were omitted as unnecessary and covered by section 507 of this title which provides for supervision of United States attorneys by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words of section 765 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;Until the time when an appropriation is made for the payment of the judgment or decree&rdquo; were omitted and words &ldquo;up to, but not exceeding, thirty days after the date of approval of any appropriation act providing for payment of the judgment&rdquo; were substituted.

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a judgment for costs, as enumerated in section 1920 of this title, but not including the <!-- PDFPage:539 -->fees and expenses of attorneys, may be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action. A judgment for costs when taxed against the United States shall, in an amount established by statute, court rule, or order, be limited to reimbursing in whole or in part the prevailing party for the costs incurred by such party in the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A judgment for costs, when awarded in favor of the United States in an action brought by the United States, may include an amount equal to the filing fee prescribed under section 1914(a) of this title. The preceding sentence shall not be construed as requiring the United States to pay any filing fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Unless expressly prohibited by statute, a court may award reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, in addition to the costs which may be awarded pursuant to subsection (a), to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action. The United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Any judgment against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity for costs pursuant to subsection (a) shall be paid as provided in sections 2414 and 2517 of this title and shall be in addition to any relief provided in the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any judgment against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity for fees and expenses of attorneys pursuant to subsection (b) shall be paid as provided in sections 2414 and 2517 of this title, except that if the basis for the award is a finding that the United States acted in bad faith, then the award shall be paid by any agency found to have acted in bad faith and shall be in addition to any relief provided in the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1)(A) Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed. The party shall also allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified. Whether or not the position of the United States was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record (including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based) which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The court, in its discretion, may reduce the amount to be awarded pursuant to this subsection, or deny an award, to the extent that the prevailing party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If, in a civil action brought by the United States or a proceeding for judicial review of an adversary adjudication described in section 504(a)(4) of title 5, the demand by the United States is substantially in excess of the judgment finally obtained by the United States and is unreasonable when compared with such judgment, under the facts and circumstances of the case, the court shall award to the party the fees and other expenses related to defending against the excessive demand, unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. Fees and expenses awarded under this subparagraph shall be paid only as a consequence of appropriations provided in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;fees and other expenses&rdquo; includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found by the court to be necessary for the preparation of the party's case, and reasonable attorney fees (The amount of fees awarded under this subsection shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that (i) no expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the United States; and (ii) attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;party&rdquo; means (i) an individual whose net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed, or (ii) any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization, the net worth of which did not exceed $7,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed, and which had not more than 500 employees at the time the civil action was filed; except that an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code, or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing <!-- PDFPage:540 -->Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), may be a party regardless of the net worth of such organization or cooperative association or for purposes of subsection (d)(1)(D), a small entity as defined in section 601 of title 5;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) &ldquo;civil action brought by or against the United States&rdquo; includes an appeal by a party, other than the United States, from a decision of a contracting officer rendered pursuant to a disputes clause in a contract with the Government or pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) &ldquo;court&rdquo; includes the United States Court of Federal Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) &ldquo;final judgment&rdquo; means a judgment that is final and not appealable, and includes an order of settlement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) &ldquo;prevailing party&rdquo;, in the case of eminent domain proceedings, means a party who obtains a final judgment (other than by settlement), exclusive of interest, the amount of which is at least as close to the highest valuation of the property involved that is attested to at trial on behalf of the property owner as it is to the highest valuation of the property involved that is attested to at trial on behalf of the Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) &ldquo;demand&rdquo; means the express demand of the United States which led to the adversary adjudication, but shall not include a recitation of the maximum statutory penalty (i) in the complaint, or (ii) elsewhere when accompanied by an express demand for a lesser amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In awarding fees and other expenses under this subsection to a prevailing party in any action for judicial review of an adversary adjudication, as defined in subsection (b)(1)(C) of section 504 of title 5, United States Code, or an adversary adjudication subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, the court shall include in that award fees and other expenses to the same extent authorized in subsection (a) of such section, unless the court finds that during such adversary adjudication the position of the United States was substantially justified, or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Fees and other expenses awarded under this subsection to a party shall be paid by any agency over which the party prevails from any funds made available to the agency by appropriation or otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any costs, fees, and other expenses in connection with any proceeding to which section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies (determined without regard to subsections (b) and (f) of such section). Nothing in the preceding sentence shall prevent the awarding under subsection (a) of section 2412 of title 28, United States Code, of costs enumerated in section 1920 of such title (as in effect on October 1, 1981).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) If the United States appeals an award of costs or fees and other expenses made against the United States under this section and the award is affirmed in whole or in part, interest shall be paid on the amount of the award as affirmed. Such interest shall be computed at the rate determined under section 1961(a) of this title, and shall run from the date of the award through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) was drafted to clarify a serious ambiguity in existing law and is based upon rulings of the Supreme Court. Numerous sections in the United States Code prescribe civil fines, penalties, and pecuniary forfeitures for violation of certain sections without specifying the mode of recovery or enforcement thereof. See, for example, section 567 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, section 64 of title 14, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Coast Guard, and section 180 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. Compare section 1 (21) of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">A civil fine, penalty, or pecuniary forfeiture is recoverable in a civil action. <em>United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess</em> et al., 1943, 63 S.Ct. 379, 317 U.S. 537, 87 L.Ed. 433, rehearing denied 63 S.Ct. 756, 318 U.S. 799, 87 L.Ed. 1163; <em>Hepner v. United States</em>, 1909, 29 S.Ct. 474, 213 U.S. 103, 53 L.Ed. 720, and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="note-body">Forfeiture of bail bonds in criminal cases are enforceable by procedure set out in Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the statute contemplates a criminal fine, it can only be recovered in a criminal proceeding under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, after a conviction. The collection of civil fines and penalties, however, may not be had under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 54(b)(5), but enforcement of a criminal fine imposed in a criminal case may be had by execution on the judgment rendered in such case, as in civil actions. (See section 569 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, incorporated in section 3565 of H.R. 1600, 80th Congress, for revision of the Criminal Code. See also Rule 69 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Advisory Committee Note thereunder, as to execution in civil actions.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) was drafted to cover the subject of forfeiture of property generally. Sections in the United States Code specifically providing a mode of enforcement of forfeiture of property for their violation and other procedural matters will, of course, govern and subsection (b) will not affect them. It will only cover cases where no mode of recovery is prescribed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;Unless otherwise provided by enactment of Congress&rdquo; were inserted at the beginning of subsection (b) to exclude from its application instances where a libel in admiralty is not required. For example, under sections 1607, 1609, and 1610 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, the collector of customs may, by summary procedure, sell at public auction, without previous declaration of forfeiture or libel proceedings, any vessel, etc., under $1,000 in value in cases where no claim for the same is filed or bond given as required by customs laws.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:547 --><p class="note-body">Rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure makes such rules applicable to the appeals in cases of seizures on land. (See also <em>443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United States</em>, 1912, 33 S.Ct. 50, 226 U.S. 172, 57 L.Ed. 174, and <em>Eureka Productions v. Mulligan</em>, C.C.A. 1940, 108 F.2d 760.) The proceeding, which resembles a suit in admiralty in that it is begun by a libel, is, strictly speaking, an &ldquo;action at law&rdquo; (The Sarah, 1823, 8 Wheat. 391, 21 U.S. 391, 5 L.Ed. 644; Morris's Cotton, 1869, 8 Wall. 507, 75 U.S. 507, 19 L.Ed. 481; Confiscation cases, 1873, 20 Wall. 92, 87 U.S. 92, 22 L.Ed. 320; <em>Eureka Productions v. Mulligan</em>, supra), even though the statute may direct that the proceedings conform to admiralty as near as may be. <em>In re Graham</em>, 1870, 10 Wall. 541, 19 L.Ed. 981, and <em>443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United States</em>, supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is in conformity with Rule 21 of the Supreme Court Admiralty Rules, which recognizes that a libel may be filed upon seizure for any breach of any enactment of Congress, whether on land or on the high seas or on navigable waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. Such rule also permits an information to be filed, but is rarely, if ever, used at present. Consequently, &ldquo;information&rdquo; has been omitted from the text and only &ldquo;libel&rdquo; is incorporated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except in cases of seizures for forfeiture under any law of the United States, whenever a warrant of arrest or other process in rem is issued in any admiralty case, the United States marshal shall stay the execution of such process, or discharge the property arrested if the process has been levied, on receiving from the respondent or claimant of the property a bond or stipulation in double the amount claimed by the libellant, with sufficient surety, to be approved by the judge of the district court where the case is pending, or, in his absence, by the collector of the port, conditioned to answer the decree of the court in such case. Such bond or stipulation shall be returned to the court, and judgment or decree thereon, against both the principal and sureties, may be secured at the time of rendering the decree in the original case. The owner of any vessel may deliver to the marshal a bond or stipulation, with sufficient surety, to be approved by the judge of the district court, conditioned to answer the decree of such court in all or any cases that are brought thereafter in such court against the vessel. Thereupon the execution of all such process against such vessel shall be stayed so long as the amount secured by such bond or stipulation is at least double the aggregate amount claimed by libellants in such suits which are begun and pending against such vessel. Similar judgments or decrees and remedies may be had on such bond or stipulation as if a special bond or stipulation had been filed in each of such suits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The court may make necessary orders to carry this section into effect, particularly in giving proper notice of any such suit. Such bond or stipulation shall be indorsed by the clerk with a minute of the suits wherein process is so stayed. Further security may be required by the court at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a special bond or stipulation in the particular case is given under this section, the liability as to said case on the general bond or stipulation shall cease. The parties may stipulate the amount of the bond or stipulation for the release of a vessel or other property to be not more than the amount claimed in the libel, with interest, plus an allowance for libellant's costs. In the event of the inability or refusal of the parties to so stipulate, the court shall fix the amount, but if not so fixed then a bond shall be required in the amount prescribed in this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;a person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;married women first accrued during marriage, of persons under the age of twenty-one years first accrued during minority, and of idiots, lunatics, insane persons, and persons beyond the seas at the time the claim accrued; entitled to the claim,&rdquo;.

<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;nor shall any of the said disabilities operate cumulatively&rdquo; were omitted, in view of the elimination of the reference to specific disabilities.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) For more than 40 years the Federal Tort Claims Act [28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.] has been the legal mechanism for compensating persons injured by negligent or wrongful acts of Federal employees committed within the scope of their employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The United States, through the Federal Tort Claims Act, is responsible to injured persons for the common law torts of its employees in the same manner in which the common law historically has recognized the responsibility of an employer for torts committed by its employees within the scope of their employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Because Federal employees for many years have been protected from personal common law tort liability by a broad based immunity, the Federal Tort Claims Act has served as the sole means for compensating persons injured by the tortious conduct of Federal employees.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Recent judicial decisions, and particularly the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Westfall v. Erwin, have seriously eroded the common law tort immunity previously available to Federal employees.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) This erosion of immunity of Federal employees from common law tort liability has created an immediate crisis involving the prospect of personal liability and the threat of protracted personal tort litigation for the entire Federal workforce.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The prospect of such liability will seriously undermine the morale and well being of Federal employees, impede the ability of agencies to carry out their missions, and diminish the vitality of the Federal Tort Claims Act as the proper remedy for Federal employee torts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In its opinion in Westfall v. Erwin, the Supreme Court indicated that the Congress is in the best position to determine the extent to which Federal employees should be personally liable for common law torts, and that legislative consideration of this matter would be useful.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note under section 1 of this title] to protect Federal employees from personal liability for common law torts committed within the scope of their employment, while providing persons injured by the common law torts of Federal employees with an appropriate remedy against the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The authority of any federal agency to sue and be sued in its own name shall not be construed to authorize suits against such federal agency on claims which are cognizable under section 1346(b) of this title, and the remedies provided by this title in such cases shall be exclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672 of this title for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment is exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for money damages by reason of the same subject matter against the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim or against the estate of such employee. Any other civil action or proceeding for money damages arising out of or relating to the same subject matter against the employee or the employee's estate is precluded without regard to when the act or omission occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which is brought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which is brought for a violation of a statute of the United States under which such action against an individual is otherwise authorized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Attorney General shall defend any civil action or proceeding brought in any court against any employee of the Government or his estate for any such damage or injury. The employee against whom such civil action or proceeding is brought shall deliver within such time after date of service or knowledge of service as determined by the Attorney General, all process served upon him or an attested true copy thereof to his immediate superior or to whomever was designated by the head of his department to receive such papers and such person shall promptly furnish copies of the pleadings and process therein to the United States attorney for the district embracing the place wherein the proceeding is brought, to the Attorney General, and to the head of his employing Federal agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a United States district court shall be deemed an action against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending. Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that the Attorney General has refused to certify scope of office or employment under this section, the employee may at any time before trial petition the court to find and certify that the employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment. Upon such certification by the court, such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. A copy of the petition shall be served upon the United States <!-- PDFPage:576 -->in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event the petition is filed in a civil action or proceeding pending in a State court, the action or proceeding may be removed without bond by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which it is pending. If, in considering the petition, the district court determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his office or employment, the action or proceeding shall be remanded to the State court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon certification, any action or proceeding subject to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall proceed in the same manner as any action against the United States filed pursuant to section 1346(b) of this title and shall be subject to the limitations and exceptions applicable to those actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Whenever an action or proceeding in which the United States is substituted as the party defendant under this subsection is dismissed for failure first to present a claim pursuant to section 2675(a) of this title, such a claim shall be deemed to be timely presented under section 2401(b) of this title if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the claim would have been timely had it been filed on the date the underlying civil action was commenced, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the claim is presented to the appropriate Federal agency within 60 days after dismissal of the civil action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Attorney General may compromise or settle any claim asserted in such civil action or proceeding in the manner provided in section 2677, and with the same effect.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 946 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was derived from section 424(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, was omitted from this revised title. It preserved the existing authority of federal agencies to settle tort claims not cognizable under section 2672 of this title. Certain enumerated laws granting such authority were specifically repealed by section 424(a) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, which section was also omitted from this revised title. These provisions were not included in this revised title as they are not properly a part of a code of general and permanent law.</p>

Three copies of the notice shall be served on each such person. The form and content of such notice shall be approved jointly by a majority of the chief judges of the Federal districts in the State in which the court is located and shall be in substantially the following form:</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;notice</cap-smallcap></h3>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;You are hereby notified that this [property] is being taken by the United States Government (&lsquo;the Government&rsquo;), which says that [name of debtor] owes it a debt of $ [amount] for [reason for debt] and has filed a lawsuit to collect this debt. The Government says it must take this property at this time because [recite the pertinent ground or grounds from section 3101(b)]. The Government wants to make sure [name of debtor] will pay if the court determines that this money is owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;In addition, you are hereby notified that there are exemptions under the law which may protect some of this property from being taken by the Government if [name of debtor] can show that the exemptions apply. Below is a summary of the major exemptions which apply in most situations in the State of [State where property is located]:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">&ldquo;[A statement summarizing in plain and understandable English the election available with respect to such State under section 3014 and the types of property that may be exempted under each of the alternatives specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 3014(a), and a statement that different property may be so exempted with respect to the State in which the debtor resides.]</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;If you are [name of debtor] and you disagree with the reason the Government gives for taking your property now, or if you think you do not owe the money to the Government that it says you do, or if you think the property the Government is taking qualifies under one of the above exemptions, you have a right to ask the court to return your property to you.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;If you want a hearing, you must promptly notify the court. You must make your request in writing, and either mail it or deliver it in person to the clerk of the court at [address]. If you wish, you may use this notice to request the hearing by checking the box below and mailing this notice to the court clerk. You must also send a copy of your request to the Government at [address], so the Government will know you want a hearing. The hearing will take place within 5 days after the clerk receives your request, if you ask for it to take place that quickly, or as soon after that as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;At the hearing you may explain to the judge why you think you do not owe the money to the Government, why you disagree with the reason the Government says it must take your property at this time, or why you believe the property the Government has taken is exempt or belongs to someone else. You may make any or all of these explanations as you see fit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;If you think you live outside the Federal judicial district in which the court is located, you may request, not later than 20 days after you receive this notice, that this proceeding to take your property be transferred by the court to the Federal judicial district in which you reside. You must make your request in writing, and either mail it or deliver it in person to the clerk of the court at [address]. You must also send a copy of your request to the Government at [address], so the Government will know you want the proceeding to be transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;Be sure to keep a copy of this notice for your own records. If you have any questions about your rights or about this procedure, you should contact a lawyer, an office of public legal assistance, or the clerk of the court. The clerk is not permitted to give legal advice, but can refer you to other sources of information.&rdquo;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) By requesting, at any time before judgment on the claim for a debt, the court to hold a hearing, the debtor may move to quash the order granting such remedy. The court shall hold a hearing on such motion as soon as practicable, or, if requested by the debtor, within 5 days after receiving the request for a hearing or as soon thereafter as possible. The issues at such hearing shall be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the probable validity of the claim for the debt for which such remedy was granted and of any defense or claim of exemption asserted by such person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) compliance with any statutory requirement for the issuance of the prejudgment remedy granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the existence of any ground set forth in subsection (b); and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:586 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inadequacy of alternative remedies (if any) to protect the interests of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Writ</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the court's determination that the requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c) have been met, the court shall issue all process sufficient to put into effect the prejudgment remedy sought.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3102. Attachment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Property Subject to Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Any property in the possession, custody, or control of the debtor and in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest, except earnings, may be attached pursuant to a writ of attachment in an action or proceeding against a debtor on a claim for a debt and may be held as security to satisfy such judgment, and interest and costs, as the United States may recover on such claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The value of property attached shall not exceed the amount by which the sum of the amount of the debt claimed by the United States and the amount of interest and costs reasonably likely to be assessed against the debtor by the court exceeds the aggregate value of the nonexempt interest of the debtor in any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) property securing the debt; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) property garnished or in receivership, or income sequestered, under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the requirements of section 3101 are satisfied, a court shall issue a writ authorizing the United States to attach property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest, as security for such judgment (and interest and costs) as the United States may recover on a claim for a debt&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in an action on a contract, express or implied, against the debtor for payment of money, only if the United States shows reasonable cause to believe that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contract is not fully secured by real or personal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of the original security is substantially diminished, without any act of the United States or the person to whom the security was given, below the amount of the debt;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in an action against the debtor for damages in tort;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the debtor resides outside the jurisdiction of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in an action to recover a fine, penalty, or tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Writ; Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsections (a) and (b), a writ of attachment shall be issued by the court directing the United States marshal of the district where property described in subsection (a) is located to attach the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Several writs of attachment may be issued at the same time, or in succession, and sent to different judicial districts until sufficient property is attached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The writ of attachment shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date of the issuance of the writ;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the identity of the court, the docket number of the action, and the identity of the cause of action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the name and last known address of the debtor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the amount to be secured by the attachment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a reasonable description of the property to be attached.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Levy of Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The United States marshal receiving the writ shall proceed without delay to levy upon the property specified for attachment if found within the district. The marshal may not sell property unless ordered by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In performing the levy, the United States marshal may enter any property owned, occupied, or controlled by the debtor, except that the marshal may not enter a residence or other building unless the writ expressly authorizes the marshal to do so or upon specific order of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Levy on real property is made by entering the property and posting the writ and notice of levy in a conspicuous place upon the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Levy on personal property is made by taking possession of it. Levy on personal property not easily taken into possession or which cannot be taken into possession without great inconvenience or expense may be made by affixing a copy of the writ and notice of levy on it or in a conspicuous place in the vicinity of it describing in the notice of levy the property by quantity and with sufficient detail to identify the property levied on.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The United States marshal shall file a copy of the notice of levy in the same manner as provided for judgments in section 3201(a)(1). The United States marshal shall serve a copy of the writ and notice of levy on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the debtor against whom the writ is issued; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the person who has possession of the property subject to the writ;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">in the same manner that a summons is served in a civil action and make the return thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The return shall describe the property attached with sufficient certainty to identify it and shall state the location where it was attached, the date and time it was attached, and the disposition made of the property. If no property was attached, the return shall so state.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the property levied on is claimed, replevied under subsection (j)(2), or sold under section 3007 after the return, the United States marshal shall immediately make a further return to the clerk of the court showing the disposition of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If personal property is replevied, the United States marshal shall deliver the replevin bond to the clerk of the court to be filed in the action.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:587 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Levy of Attachment as Lien on Property; Satisfaction of Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A levy on property under a writ of attachment under this section creates a lien in favor of the United States on the property or, in the case of perishable property sold under section 3007, on the proceeds of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such lien shall be ranked ahead of any other security interests perfected after the later of the time of levy and the time a copy of the notice of levy is filed under subsection (d)(5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such lien shall arise from the time of levy and shall continue until a judgment in the action is obtained or denied, or the action is otherwise dismissed. The death of the debtor whose property is attached does not terminate the attachment lien. Upon issuance of a judgment in the action and registration under this chapter, the judgment lien so created relates back to the time of levy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Reduction or Dissolution of Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If an excessive or unreasonable attachment is made, the debtor may submit a motion to the court for a reduction of the amount of the attachment or its dissolution. Notice of such motion shall be served on the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall order a part of the property to be released, if after a hearing the court finds that the amount of the attachment is excessive or unreasonable or if the attachment is for an amount larger than the sum of the liquidated or ascertainable amount of the debt and the amount of interest and costs likely to be taxed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The court shall dissolve the attachment if the amount of the debt is unliquidated and unascertainable by calculation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any property claimed to be exempt is levied on, the debtor may, at any time after such levy, request that the court vacate such levy. If it appears to the court that the property so levied upon is exempt, the court shall order the levy vacated and the property returned to the debtor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Replevin of Attached Property by Debtor; Bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If attached property is not sold before judgment, the debtor may replevy such property or any part thereof by giving a bond approved by counsel for the United States or the court and payable to the United States in double the reasonable value of the property to be replevied or double the value of the claim, whichever is less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of Personal Property Under Attachment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If personal property in custody of the United States marshal under a writ of attachment is not replevied, claimed, or sold, the court may make such order for its preservation or use as appears to be in the interest of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Judgment and Disposition of Attached Property.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Judgment for the united states</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On entry of judgment for the United States, the court shall order the proceeds of personal property sold pursuant to section 3007 to be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment, and shall order the sale of any remaining personal property and any real property levied on to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Judgment for the united states when personal property replevied</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With respect to personal property under attachment that is replevied, the judgment which may be entered shall be against the debtor against whom the writ of attachment is issued and also against the sureties on the debtor's replevin bond for the value of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Restoration of property and exoneration of replevin bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the attachment is vacated or if the judgment on the claim for the debt is for the person against whom the writ attachment is issued, the court shall order the property, or proceeds of perishable property sold under section 3007, restored to the debtor and shall exonerate any replevin bond.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of a Receiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the requirements of section 3101 are satisfied, a court may appoint a receiver for property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest if the United States shows reasonable cause to believe that there is a substantial danger that the property will be removed from the jurisdiction of the court, lost, concealed, materially injured or damaged, or mismanaged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Powers of Receiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The appointing court may authorize a receiver&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to administer, collect, improve, lease, repair or sell pursuant to section 3007 such real and personal property as the court shall direct.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A receiver appointed to manage residential or commercial property shall have demonstrable expertise in the management of these types of property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Duration of Receivership</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A receivership shall not continue past the entry of judgment, or the conclusion of an appeal of such judgment, unless the court orders it continued under section 3203(e) or unless the court otherwise directs its continuation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Accounts; Requirement to Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A receiver shall keep written accounts itemizing receipts and expenditures, describing the property and naming the depository of receivership funds. The receiver's accounts shall be open to inspection by any person having an apparent interest in the property.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Modification of Powers; Removal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On motion of the receiver or on its own initiative, the court which appointed the receiver may remove the receiver or modify the receiver's powers at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Priority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If more than one court appoints a receiver for particular property, the receiver <!-- PDFPage:588 -->first qualifying under law shall be entitled to take possession, control, or custody of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Compensation of Receivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A receiver is entitled to such commissions, not exceeding 5 percent of the sums received and disbursed by him, as the court allows unless the court otherwise directs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the termination of a receivership, the receiver shall file a final accounting of the receipts and disbursements and apply for compensation setting forth the amount sought and the services rendered by the receiver.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;If you are [name of judgment debtor], you have a right to ask the court to return your property to you if you think the property the Government is taking qualifies under one of the above exemptions [For a default judgment:] or if you think you do not owe the money to the United States Government that it says you do.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&ldquo;If you want a hearing, you must notify the court within 20 days after you receive this notice.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Garnishee's failure to answer or pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a garnishee fails to answer the writ of garnishment or to withhold property in accordance with the writ, the United States may petition the court for an order requiring the <!-- PDFPage:595 -->garnishee to appear before the court to answer the writ and to so withhold property before the appearance date.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Priorities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Judicial orders and garnishments for the support of a person shall have priority over a writ of garnishment issued under this section. As to any other writ of garnishment or levy, a garnishment issued under this section shall have priority over writs which are issued later in time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Accounting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) While a writ of garnishment is in effect under this section, the United States shall give an annual accounting on the garnishment to the judgment debtor and the garnishee.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4001. Assumption of contractual obligations related to transfers of rights in motion pictures</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Assumption of Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In the case of a transfer of copyright ownership under United States law in a motion picture (as the terms &ldquo;transfer of copyright ownership&rdquo; and &ldquo;motion picture&rdquo; are defined in section 101 of title 17) that is produced subject to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements negotiated under the laws of the United States, if the transfer is executed on or after the effective date of this chapter and is not limited to public performance rights, the transfer instrument shall be deemed to incorporate the assumption agreements applicable to the copyright ownership being transferred that are required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement, and the transferee shall be subject to the obligations under each such assumption agreement to make residual payments and provide related notices, accruing after the effective date of the transfer and applicable to the exploitation of the rights transferred, and any remedies under each such assumption agreement for breach of those obligations, as those obligations and remedies are set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the transferee knows or has reason to know at the time of the transfer that such collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the event of a court order confirming an arbitration award against the transferor under the collective bargaining agreement, the transferor does not have the financial ability to satisfy the award within 90 days after the order is issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), &ldquo;knows or has reason to know&rdquo; means any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Actual knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Constructive knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture, arising from recordation of a document pertaining to copyright in the motion picture under section 205 of title 17 or from publication, at a site avail<!-- PDFPage:601 -->able to the public on-line that is operated by the relevant union, of information that identifies the motion picture as subject to a collective bargaining agreement with that union, if the site permits commercially reasonable verification of the date on which the information was available for access.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Clause (i) applies only if the transfer referred to in subsection (a)(1) occurs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) after the motion picture is completed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) before the motion picture is completed and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(aa) within 18 months before the filing of an application for copyright registration for the motion picture under section 408 of title 17, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(bb) if no such application is filed, within 18 months before the first publication of the motion picture in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Awareness of other facts and circumstances pertaining to a particular transfer from which it is apparent that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Scope of Exclusion of Transfers of Public Performance Rights</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, the exclusion under subsection (a) of transfers of copyright ownership in a motion picture that are limited to public performance rights includes transfers to a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer to the extent that the station, system, or programmer is functioning as an exhibitor of the motion picture, either by exhibiting the motion picture on its own network, system, service, or station, or by initiating the transmission of an exhibition that is carried on another network, system, service, or station. When a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer, or other transferee, is also functioning otherwise as a distributor or as a producer of the motion picture, the public performance exclusion does not affect any obligations imposed on the transferee to the extent that it is engaging in such functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion for Grants of Security Interests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a transfer of copyright ownership consisting solely of a mortgage, hypothecation, or other security interest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a subsequent transfer of the copyright ownership secured by the security interest described in paragraph (1) by or under the authority of the secured party, including a transfer through the exercise of the secured party's rights or remedies as a secured party, or by a subsequent transferee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The exclusion under this subsection shall not affect any rights or remedies under law or contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Deferral Pending Resolution of Bona Fide Dispute</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A transferee on which obligations are imposed under subsection (a) by virtue of paragraph (1) of that subsection may elect to defer performance of such obligations that are subject to a bona fide dispute between a union and a prior transferor until that dispute is resolved, except that such deferral shall not stay accrual of any union claims due under an applicable collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Scope of Obligations Determined by Private Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall expand or diminish the rights, obligations, or remedies of any person under the collective bargaining agreements or assumption agreements referred to in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Failure To Notify</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the transferor under subsection (a) fails to notify the transferee under subsection (a) of applicable collective bargaining obligations before the execution of the transfer instrument, and subsection (a) is made applicable to the transferee solely by virtue of subsection (a)(1)(B), the transferor shall be liable to the transferee for any damages suffered by the transferee as a result of the failure to notify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Disputes and Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any dispute concerning the application of subsections (a) through (f) shall be determined by an action in United States district court, and the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party and may also award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Comptroller General, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, shall conduct a study of the conditions in the motion picture industry that gave rise to this section, and the impact of this section on the motion picture industry. The Comptroller General shall report the findings of the study to the Congress within 2 years after the effective date of this chapter.</p>
