<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">In my first Reorganization Plan of 1968, I call for the creation of a new and powerful Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body">With this action, America will serve notice to the pusher and the peddler that their criminal acts must stop.</p>
<p class="note-body">No matter how well organized they are, we will be better organized. No matter how well they have concealed their activities, we will root them out.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics laws are fragmented. One major element&mdash;the Bureau of Narcotics&mdash;is in the Treasury Department and responsible for the control of marihuana and narcotics such as heroin. Another&mdash;the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control&mdash;is in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and is responsible for the control of dangerous drugs including depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens such as LSD.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:162 --><p class="note-body">Neither is located in the agency which is primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement&mdash;the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">This separation of responsibilities&mdash;despite the relentless and dedicated efforts of the agents of each Bureau&mdash;has complicated and hindered our response to a national menace.</p>
<p class="note-body">For example, more than nine out of ten seizures of LSD made by the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control have also turned up marihuana&mdash;but that Bureau has no jurisdiction over marihuana.</p>
<p class="note-body">In many instances, we are confronted by well organized disciplined and resourceful criminals who reap huge profits at the expense of their unfortunate victims.</p>
<p class="note-body">The response of the Federal Government must be unified. And it must be total.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, in my Message on Crime, I recommended strong new laws to control dangerous drugs. I also recommended an increase of more than thirty percent in the number of Federal agents enforcing the narcotic and dangerous drug laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">I now propose that a single Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs be established in the Department of Justice to administer those laws and to bring to the American people the most efficient and effective Federal enforcement machinery we can devise.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under this Reorganization Plan the Attorney General will have full authority and responsibility for enforcing the Federal laws relating to narcotics and dangerous drugs. The new Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, to be headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General, will:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;consolidate the authority and preserve the experience and manpower of the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;work with states and local governments in their crackdown on illegal trade in drugs and narcotics, and help to train local agents and investigators.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;maintain worldwide operations, working closely with other nations, to suppress the trade in illicit narcotics and marihuana.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;conduct an extensive campaign of research and a nationwide public education program on drug abuse and its tragic effects.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Plan I forward today moves in the direction recommended by two distinguished groups:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;1949 Hoover Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;the 1963 Presidential Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body">This Administration and this Congress have the will and the determination to stop the illicit traffic in drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body">But we need more than the will and the determination. We need a modern and efficient instrument of Government to transform our plans into action. That is what this Reorganization Plan calls for.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have also found that, by reason of these reorganizations, it is necessary to include in the accompanying plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the five new positions as specified in section 3 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these new positions are those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable positions in the Executive Branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Should the reorganization I propose take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of Federal law enforcement functions. It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the reduction in expenditures which may result.</p>
<p class="note-body">I recommend that the Congress allow this urgently needed and important Reorganization Plan to become effective.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">Drug abuse is one of the most vicious and corrosive forces attacking the foundations of American society today. It is a major cause of crime and a merciless destroyer of human lives. We must fight it with all of the resources at our command.</p>
<p class="note-body">This Administration has declared all-out, global war on the drug menace. As I reported to the Congress earlier this month in my State of the Union message, there is evidence of significant progress on a number of fronts in that war.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both the rate of new addiction to heroin and the number of narcotic-related deaths showed an encouraging downturn last year. More drug addicts and abusers are in treatment and rehabilitation programs than ever before.</p>
<p class="note-body">Progress in pinching off the supply of illicit drugs was evident in last year's stepped-up volume of drug seizures worldwide&mdash;which more than doubled in 1972 over the 1971 level.</p>
<p class="note-body">Arrests of traffickers have risen by more than one-third since 1971. Prompt Congressional action on my proposal for mandatory minimum sentences for pushers of hard drugs will help ensure that convictions stemming from such arrests lead to actual imprisonment of the guilty.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notwithstanding these gains, much more must be done. The resilience of the international drug trade remains grimly impressive&mdash;current estimates suggest that we still intercept only a small fraction of all the heroin and cocaine entering this country. Local police still find that more than one of every three suspects arrested for street crimes is a narcotic abuser or addict. And the total number of Americans addicted to narcotics, suffering terribly themselves and inflicting their suffering in countless others, still stands in the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-end:notes -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">A UNIFIED COMMAND FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT</h4>
<p class="note-body">Seeking ways to intensify our counter-offensive against this menace, I am asking the Congress today to join with this Administration in strengthening and streamlining the Federal drug law enforcement effort.</p>
<p class="note-body">Funding for this effort has increased sevenfold during the past five years, from $36 million in fiscal year 1969 to $257 million in fiscal year 1974&mdash;more money is not the most pressing enforcement need at present. Nor is there a primary need for more manpower working on the problem, over 2100 new agents having already been added to the Federal drug enforcement agencies under this Administration, an increase of more than 250 percent over the 1969 level.</p>
<p class="note-body">The enforcement work could benefit significantly, however, from consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified command. Right now the Federal Government is fighting the war on drug abuse under a distinct handicap, for its efforts are those of a loosely confederated alliance facing a resourceful, elusive, worldwide enemy. Admiral Mahan, the master naval strategist, described this handicap precisely when he wrote that &ldquo;Granting the same aggregate of force, it is never as great in two hands as in one, because it is not perfectly concentrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">More specifically, the drug law enforcement activities of the United States now are not merely in two <!-- PDFPage:164 -->hands but in half a dozen. Within the Department of Justice, with no overall direction below the level of the Attorney General, these fragmented forces include the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence, and certain activities of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. The Treasury Department is also heavily engaged in enforcement work through the Bureau of Customs.</p>
<p class="note-body">This aggregation of Federal activities has grown up rapidly over the past few years in response to the urgent need for stronger anti-drug measures. It has enabled us to make a very encouraging beginning in the accelerated drug enforcement drive of this Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">But it also has serious operational and organizational shortcomings. Certainly the cold-blooded underworld networks that funnel narcotics from suppliers all over the world into the veins of American drug victims are no respecters of the bureaucratic dividing lines that now complicate our anti-drug efforts. On the contrary, these modern-day slave traders can derive only advantage from the limitations of the existing organizational patchwork. Experience has now given us a good basis for correcting those limitations, and it is time to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">I therefore propose creation of a single, comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to lead the war against illicit drug traffic.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, which I am transmitting to the Congress with this message, would establish such an agency, to be called the Drug Enforcement Administration. It would be headed by an Administrator reporting directly to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Drug Enforcement Administration would carry out the following anti-drug functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;All functions of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (which would be abolished as a separate entity by the reorganization plan);</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Those functions of the Bureau of Customs pertaining to drug investigations and intelligence (to be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General by the reorganization plan).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;All functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement; and</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;All functions of the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Merger of the latter two organizations into the new agency would be effected by an executive order dissolving them and transferring their functions, to take effect upon approval of Reorganization Plan No. 2 by the Congress. Drug law enforcement research currently funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and other agencies would also be transferred to the new agency by executive action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The major responsibility of the Drug Enforcement Administration would thus include:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;development of overall Federal drug law enforcement strategy, programs, planning, and evaluation;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects for violations under all Federal drug trafficking laws;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects connected with illicit drugs seized at U.S. ports-of-entry and international borders;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;conduct of all relations with drug law enforcement officials of foreign governments, under the policy guidance of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;full coordination and cooperation with State and local law enforcement officials on joint drug enforcement efforts; and</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;regulation of the legal manufacture of drugs and other controlled substances under Federal regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Attorney General, working closely with the Administrator of this new agency, would have authority to make needed program adjustments. He would take steps within the Department of Justice to ensure that high priority emphasis is placed on the prosecution and sentencing of drug traffickers following their apprehension by the enforcement organization. He would also have the authority and responsibility for securing the fullest possible cooperation-particularly with respect to collection of drug intelligence&mdash;from all Federal departments and agencies which can contribute to the anti-drug work, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">My proposals would make possible a more effective antidrug role for the FBI, especially in dealing with the relationship between drug trafficking and organized crime. I intend to see that the resources of the FBI are fully committed to assist in supporting the new Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">The consolidation effected under Reorganization Plan No. 2 would reinforce the basic law enforcement and criminal justice mission of the Department of Justice. With worldwide drug law enforcement responsibilities no longer divided among several organizations in two different Cabinet departments, more complete and cumulative drug law enforcement intelligence could be compiled. Patterns of international and domestic illicit drug production, distribution, and sale could be more directly compared and interpreted. Case-by-case drug law enforcement activities could be more comprehensively linked, cross-referenced, and coordinated into a single, organic enforcement operation. In short, drug law enforcement officers would be able to spend more time going after the traffickers and less time coordinating with one another.</p>
<p class="note-body">Such progress could be especially helpful on the international front. Narcotics control action plans, developed under the leadership of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, are now being carried out by U.S. officials in cooperation with host governments in 59 countries around the world. This wide-ranging effort to cut off drug supplies before they ever reach U.S. borders or streets is just now beginning to bear fruit. We can enhance its effectiveness, with little disruption of ongoing enforcement activities, by merging both the highly effective narcotics force of overseas Customs agents and the rapidly developing international activities of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs into the Drug Enforcement Administration. The new agency would work closely with the Cabinet Committee under the active leadership of the U.S. Ambassador in each country where anti-drug programs are underway.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two years ago, when I established the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention within the Executive Office of the President, we gained an organization with the necessary resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to begin dealing decisively with the &ldquo;demand&rdquo; side of the drug abuse problem&mdash;treatment and rehabilitation for those who have been drug victims, and preventive programs for potential drug abusers. This year, by permitting my reorganization proposals to take effect, the Congress can help provide a similar capability on the &ldquo;supply&rdquo; side. The proposed Drug Enforcement Administration, working as a team with the Special Action Office, would arm Americans with a potent one-two punch to help us fight back against the deadly menace of drug abuse. I ask full Congressional cooperation in its establishment.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">IMPROVING PORT-OF-ENTRY INSPECTIONS</h4>
<p class="note-body">No heroin or cocaine is produced within the United States; domestic availability of these substances results solely from their illegal importation. The careful and complete inspection of all persons and goods coming into the United States is therefore an integral part of effective Federal drug law enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body">At the present time, however, Federal responsibility for conducting port-of-entry inspections is awkwardly divided among several Cabinet departments. The principal agencies involved are the Treasury Department's Bureau of Customs, which inspects goods, and the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, which inspects persons and their papers. The two utilize separate inspection procedures, hold differ<!-- PDFPage:165 -->ing views of inspection priorities, and employ dissimilar personnel management practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">To reduce the possibility that illicit drugs will escape detection at ports-of-entry because of divided responsibility, and to enhance the effectiveness of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the reorganization plan which I am proposing today would transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury all functions currently vested in Justice Department officials to inspect persons, or the documents of persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">When the plan takes effect, it is my intention to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to use the resources so transferred&mdash;including some 1,000 employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service&mdash;to augment the staff and budget of the Bureau of Customs. The Bureau's primary responsibilities would then include:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;inspection of all persons and goods entering the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;valuation of goods being imported, and assessment of appropriate tariff duties;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;interception of contraband being smuggled into the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;enforcement of U.S. laws governing the international movement of goods, except the investigation of contraband drugs and narcotics; and</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;turning over the investigation responsibility for all drug law enforcement cases to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization would thus group most port-of-entry inspection functions in a single Cabinet department. It would reduce the need for much day-to-day interdepartmental coordination, allow more efficient staffing at some field locations, and remove the basis for damaging interagency rivalries. It would also give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority and flexibility to meet changing requirements in inspecting the international flow of people and goods. An important by-product of the change would be more convenient service for travellers entering and leaving the country.</p>
<p class="note-body">For these reasons, I am convinced that inspection activities at U.S. ports-of-entry can more effectively support our drug law enforcement efforts if concentrated in a single agency. The processing of persons at ports-of-entry is too closely interrelated with the inspection of goods to remain organizationally separated from it any longer. Both types of inspections have numerous objectives besides drug law enforcement, so it is logical to vest them in the Treasury Department, which has long had the principal responsibility for port-of-entry inspection of goods, including goods being transported in connection with persons. As long as the inspections are conducted with full awareness of related drug concerns it is neither necessary nor desirable that they be made a responsibility of the primary drug enforcement organization.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">DECLARATIONS</h4>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found that each action included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive of the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1): &ldquo;to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;&rdquo; Section 901(a)(3): &ldquo;to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;&rdquo; Section 901(a)(5) &ldquo;to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government;&rdquo; and Section 901(a)(6): &ldquo;to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">As required by law, the plan has one logically consistent subject matter: consolidation of Federal drug law enforcement activities in a manner designed to increase their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="note-body">The plan would establish in the Department of Justice a new Administration designated as the Drug Enforcement Administration. The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in Section 5 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which may result from the actions proposed, some savings may be anticipated in administrative costs now associated with the functions being transferred and consolidated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed reorganization is a necessary step in upgrading the effectiveness of our Nation's drug law enforcement effort. Both of the proposed changes would build on the strengths of established agencies, yielding maximum gains in the battle against drug abuse with minimum loss of time and momentum in the transition.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section is revised to express the effect of the law.

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12988, Feb. 5, 1996, 61 F.R. 4729, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to improve access to justice for all persons who wish to avail themselves of court and administrative adjudicatory tribunals to resolve disputes, to facilitate the just and efficient resolution of civil claims involving the United States Government, to encourage the filing of only meritorious civil claims, to improve legislative and regulatory drafting to reduce needless litigation, to promote fair and prompt adjudication before administrative tribunals, and to provide a model for similar reforms of litigation practices in the private sector and in various states, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Guidelines to Promote Just and Efficient Government Civil Litigation</em>. To promote the just and efficient resolution of civil claims, those Federal agencies and litigation counsel that conduct or otherwise participate in civil litigation on behalf of the United States Government in Federal court shall respect and adhere to the following guidelines during the conduct of such litigation:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Pre-filing Notice of a Complaint</em>. No litigation counsel shall file a complaint initiating civil litigation without first making a reasonable effort to notify all disputants about the nature of the dispute and to attempt to achieve a settlement, or confirming that the referring agency that previously handled the dispute has made a reasonable effort to notify the disputants and to achieve a settlement or has used its conciliation processes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Settlement Conferences</em>. As soon as practicable after ascertaining the nature of a dispute in litigation, and throughout the litigation, litigation counsel shall evaluate settlement possibilities and make reasonable efforts to settle the litigation. Such efforts shall include offering to participate in a settlement conference or moving the court for a conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 App. U.S.C.] in an attempt to resolve the dispute without additional civil litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Alternative Methods of Resolving the Dispute in Litigation</em>. Litigation counsel shall make reasonable attempts to resolve a dispute expeditiously and properly before proceeding to trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Whenever feasible, claims should be resolved through informal discussions, negotiations, and settlements rather than through utilization of any formal court proceeding. Where the benefits of Alternative Dispute Resolution (&ldquo;ADR&rdquo;) may be derived, and after consultation with the agency referring the matter, litigation counsel should suggest the use of an appropriate ADR technique to the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) It is appropriate to use ADR techniques or processes to resolve claims of or against the United States or its agencies, after litigation counsel determines that the use of a particular technique is warranted in the context of a particular claim or claims, and that such use will materially contribute to the prompt, fair, and efficient resolution of the claims.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) To facilitate broader and effective use of informal and formal ADR methods, litigation counsel should be trained in ADR techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Discovery</em>. To the extent practical, litigation counsel shall make every reasonable effort to streamline and expedite discovery in cases under counsel's supervision and control.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) <em>Review of Proposed Document Requests</em>. Each agency within the executive branch shall establish a coordinated procedure for the conduct and review of document discovery undertaken in litigation directly by that agency when that agency is litigation counsel. The procedure shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, review by a senior lawyer prior to service or filing of the request in litigation to determine that the request is not cumulative or duplicative, unreasonable, oppressive, unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the requirements of the litigation, the amount in controversy, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and whether the documents can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) <em>Discovery Motions</em>. Before petitioning a court to resolve a discovery motion or petitioning a court to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, litigation counsel shall attempt to resolve the dispute with opposing counsel. If litigation counsel makes a discovery motion concerning the dispute, he or she shall represent in that motion that any attempt at resolution was unsuccessful or impracticable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) <em>Sanctions</em>. Litigation counsel shall take steps to seek sanctions against opposing counsel and opposing parties where appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Litigation counsel shall evaluate filings made by opposing parties and, where appropriate, shall petition <!-- PDFPage:170 -->the court to impose sanctions against those responsible for abusive practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Prior to filing a motion for sanctions, litigation counsel shall submit the motion for review to the sanctions officer, or his or her designee, within the litigation counsel's agency. Such officer or designee shall be a senior supervising attorney within the agency, and shall be licensed to practice law before a State court, courts of the District of Columbia, or courts of any territory or Commonwealth of the United States. The sanctions officer or designee shall also review motions for sanctions that are filed against litigation counsel, the United States, its agencies, or its officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) <em>Improved Use of Litigation Resources</em>. Litigation counsel shall employ efficient case management techniques and shall make reasonable efforts to expedite civil litigation in cases under that counsel's supervision and control. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) making reasonable efforts to negotiate with other parties about, and stipulate to, facts that are not in dispute;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) reviewing and revising pleadings and other filings to ensure that they are accurate and that they reflect a narrowing of issues, if any, that has resulted from discovery;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) requesting early trial dates where practicable;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) moving for summary judgment in every case where the movant would be likely to prevail, or where the motion is likely to narrow the issues to be tried; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) reviewing and revising pleadings and other filings to ensure that unmeritorious threshold defenses and jurisdictional arguments, resulting in unnecessary delay, are not raised.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Government Pro Bono and Volunteer Service</em>. All Federal agencies should develop appropriate programs to encourage and facilitate pro bono legal and other volunteer service by government employees to be performed on their own time, including attorneys, as permitted by statute, regulation, or other rule or guideline.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Principles to Enact Legislation and Promulgate Regulations Which Do Not Unduly Burden the Federal Court System.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>General Duty to Review Legislation and Regulations</em>. Within current budgetary constraints and existing executive branch coordination mechanisms and procedures established in OMB Circular A-19 and Executive Order No. 12866 [5 U.S.C. 601 note], each agency promulgating new regulations, reviewing existing regulations, developing legislative proposals concerning regulations, and developing new legislation shall adhere to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be reviewed by the agency to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be written to minimize litigation; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, and shall promote simplification and burden reduction.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Specific Issues for Review</em>. In conducting the reviews required by subsection (a), each agency formulating proposed legislation and regulations shall make every reasonable effort to ensure:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) that the legislation, as appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) specifies whether all causes of action arising under the law are subject to statutes of limitations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) specifies in clear language the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the law;</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal law, if any, including all provisions repealed, circumscribed, displaced, impaired, or modified;</p>
<p class="note-body">(D) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct;</p>
<p class="note-body">(E) specifies whether private arbitration and other forms of private dispute resolution are appropriate under enforcement and relief provisions; subject to constitutional requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(F) specifies whether the provisions of the law are severable if one or more of them is found to be unconstitutional;</p>
<p class="note-body">(G) specifies in clear language the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the law;</p>
<p class="note-body">(H) specifies in clear language the applicable burdens of proof;</p>
<p class="note-body">(I) specifies in clear language whether it grants private parties a right to sue and, if so, the relief available and the conditions and terms for authorized awards of attorney's fees, if any;</p>
<p class="note-body">(J) specifies whether State courts have jurisdiction under the law and, if so, whether and under what conditions an action would be removable to Federal court;</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Improvements in Administrative Adjudication</em>. All Federal agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes and develop specific procedures to reduce delay in decision-making, to facilitate self-representation where appropriate, to expand non-lawyer counseling and representation where appropriate, and to invest maximum discretion in fact-finding officers to encourage appropriate settlement of claims as early as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Bias</em>. All Federal agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes to identify any type of bias on the part of the decision-makers that results in an injustice to persons who appear before administrative adjudicatory tribunals; regularly train all fact-finders, administrative law judges, and other decision-makers to eliminate such bias; and establish appropriate mechanisms to receive and resolve complaints of such bias from persons who appear before administrative adjudicatory tribunals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Public Education</em>. All Federal agencies should develop effective and simple methods, including the use of electronic technology, to educate the public about its claims/benefits policies and procedures.</p>

Such guidelines shall serve as models for internal guidelines that may be issued by other agencies pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;agency&rdquo; shall be defined as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The term &ldquo;litigation counsel&rdquo; shall be defined as the trial counsel or the office in which such trial counsel is employed, such as the United States Attorney's Office for the district in which the litigation is pending or a litigating division of the Department of Justice. Special Assistant United States Attorneys are included within this definition. Those agencies authorized by law to represent themselves in court without assistance from the Department of Justice are also included in this definition, as are private counsel hired by any Federal agency to conduct litigation on behalf of the agency or the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>No Private Rights Created</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch in resolving disputes, conducting litigation in a reasonable and just manner, and reviewing legislation and regulations. This order shall not be construed as creating any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person. This order shall not be construed to create any right to judicial review involving the compliance or noncompliance of the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person with this order. Nothing in this order shall be construed to obligate the United States to accept a particular settlement or resolution of a dispute, to alter its standards for accepting settlements, to forego seeking a consent decree or other relief, or to alter any existing delegation of settlement or litigating authority.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Scope.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>No Applicability to Criminal Matters or Proceedings in Foreign Courts</em>. This order is applicable to civil matters only. It is not intended to affect criminal matters, including enforcement of criminal fines or judgments of criminal forfeiture. This order does not apply to litigation brought by or against the United States in foreign courts or tribunals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Application of Notice Provision</em>. Notice pursuant to subsection (a) of section 1 is not required (1) in any action to seize or forfeit assets subject to forfeiture or in any action to seize property; (2) in any bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship, receivership, or liquidation proceeding; (3) when the assets that are the subject of the action or that would satisfy the judgment are subject to flight, dissipation, or destruction; (4) when the defendant is subject to flight; (5) when, as determined by litigation counsel, exigent circumstances make providing such notice impracticable or such notice would otherwise defeat the purpose of the litigation, such as in actions seeking temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctive relief; or (6) in those limited classes of cases where the Attorney General determines that providing such notice would defeat the purpose of the litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Additional Guidance as to Scope</em>. The Attorney General shall have the authority to issue further guidance as to the scope of this order, except section 3, consistent with the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>Conflicts with Other Rules</em>.

Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301 of title 5, United States Code.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section is supplied for convenience and clarification. The Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice, the earliest predecessor agency of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was created administratively in 1908. It appears that funds used for the Bureau of Investigation were first obtained through the Department of Justice Appropriation Act of May 22, 1908, ch. 186, &sect;1 (par. beginning &ldquo;From the appropriations for the prosecution of crimes&rdquo;), 35 Stat. 236, although that statutory provision makes no express mention of the Bureau or of the investigative function.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, specifically recognized the Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice and provided that all that Bureau's functions together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition were &ldquo;transferred to and consolidated in a Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Division of Investigation was first designated as the &ldquo;Federal Bureau of Investigation&rdquo; by the Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39, title II, 49 Stat. 77, and has been so designated in statutes since that date.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section is from the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1965. Similar provisions were contained in each appropriation Act for the Department running back to 1921, which Acts are identified in a note under sections 299 and 300 of title 5, U.S.C. 1964 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The section is reorganized for clarity. The authority to appoint officials for the cited purposes is implied. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;is authorized to&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;who shall be vested with the authority necessary for the execution of such duties&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary as the appointment of the officials for the purposes indicated carries with it the authority necessary to perform their duties.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (2), the words &ldquo;to assist in&rdquo; are added for clarity and in recognition of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3056 which vest in the United States Secret Service the responsibility for the protection of the person of the President. As so revised, this paragraph will assure that the Secret Service will continue to have primary responsibility for the protection of the President but at the same time will permit the Federal Bureau of Investigation to render assistance in such protection.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence is added because in various areas the authority to investigate certain criminal offenses has been specifically assigned by statute to departments and agencies other than the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For example, the enforcement of the internal revenue laws is specifically a function of the Secretary of the Treasury and he is authorized to employ such number of persons as he deems proper for the enforcement of such laws (26 U.S.C. 7801, 7803). The Secretary of the Treasury is specifically authorized to direct the collection of duties on imports and to appoint such employees for that purpose as he deems necessary (19 U.S.C. 3, 6). The U.S. Coast Guard is specifically authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing the Federal laws upon the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (14 U.S.C. 2). Subject to the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secret Service is specifically authorized to detect and arrest persons committing offenses against the laws of the United States relating to coins and obligations and securities of the United States and foreign governments (18 U.S.C. 3056).</p>

<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;United States attorney&rdquo; was adopted in this section for &ldquo;attorney for the United States.&rdquo; Since the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in In re Neagle, 1890 (10 S. Ct. 658, 135 U.S. 1, 34, L. Ed. 55) where the terms &ldquo;attorneys of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;district attorneys&rdquo; were used interchangeably, Congress has also designated such officers as either &ldquo;United States attorneys&rdquo; or as &ldquo;district attorneys.&rdquo; See Acts of Feb. 22, 1886, ch. 928, &sect;7, 24 Stat. 309; July 3, 1890, ch. 656, &sect;16, 26 Stat. 217; July 10, 1890, ch. 664, &sect;16, 26 Stat. 225, and Acts of July 20, 1882, ch. 312, &sect;3, 22 Stat. 172; Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 100, &sect;3, 38 Stat. 961; May 28, 1926, ch. 414, &sect;2(b), 44 Stat. 672.</p>
<p class="note-body">At present, such officers are invariably designated as &ldquo;United States attorneys&rdquo; by Federal courts and the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;The President may appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,&rdquo; were inserted to conform section with the Constitution. See article II, section 2, clause 2.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;including the District of Columbia&rdquo; were omitted, because the District is made a judicial district by section 88 of this title. District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., &sect;11&ndash;1001, provided for appointment of an &ldquo;attorney of the United States for the District&rdquo; by the President, subject to Senate confirmation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;learned in the law&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary. Such requirement is not made of United States judges and no reason appears to make a distinction respecting United States attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">Parts of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., remain in said title 48. For remainder thereof, see Distribution Table. Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 504 [now 541 and 544], and 541 [see 561] of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision permitting the United States attorney and his assistants to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few Federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein. Also the residence requirement of this section has no relation to domicile or voting residence nor does it affect the citizenship or residence status of District of Columbia officeholders in the several States from which appointed.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 330 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which required that United States attorneys should conduct, under direction of the General Counsel of the Treasury, all suits and proceedings involving the United States under the laws governing national banking associations is covered by subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">The second paragraph of former section 509 is omitted as it was superseded by the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph was based in part on former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in section 5706 of title 5, United States Code, substantially reenacted former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was repealed by the Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, by which title 28 was originally enacted. The purpose of section 6 was to allow reimbursement for only such actual and necessary travel expenses incurred unless otherwise permitted by the Act of 1949 itself or by laws relating to the military. Section 6 did not, however, provide for the exception of United States attorneys as did former section 73.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1949, which are codified in sections 5701 and 5702 of title 5, United States Code, defined the coverage of the Act and allowed for specific exclusions in the legislative and judicial branches but did not mention an exclusion in the executive branch for United States attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 7 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5707 of title 5, United States Code, expressly vested in the Director of the Bureau of the Budget the authority to prescribe regulations covering travel allowances and the reimbursement of travel expenses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(1), (2) of title 5, United States Code, made specific exclusions from the coverage of the Act, and United States attorneys were not so excluded.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 9 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(3), (4) of title 5, United States Code, modified acts inconsistent with the 1949 Act, and specifically mentioned acts which authorize reimbursement of &ldquo;actual and necessary&rdquo; expenses.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Prior section 509.&mdash;</em>Based on sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;586, 587 and 592 (R.S. &sect;&sect;368, 833, 834; Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 133, &sect;1, 18 Stat. 452; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, &sect;&sect;13, 14, 24, 29 Stat. 183, 186; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, &sect;1, 34 Stat. 1360; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, &sect;1, 35 Stat. 375; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167; July 1, 1918, ch. 113, &sect;1, 40 Stat. 683; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, &sect;1, 41 Stat. 209; Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825, &sect;3, 56 Stat. 1089).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates parts of sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and of sections 586, 587, and 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">First paragraph of this section is from section 587 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which did not apply to Alaska because of the restriction in section 591 of said title 28. However, the latter section has been superseded, in that respect, by subsequent appropriation acts, the latest being act July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title II, 60 Stat. 460, which specifically allows office expenses for United States attorneys in Alaska. This section applies to all United States attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 73 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., allowed only actual traveling expenses to Government employees, except &ldquo;district attorneys,&rdquo; marshals and clerks of courts and their deputies. It has been superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926. See sections 821 et seq. of said title 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">References in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to absence &ldquo;from their respective official residences&rdquo; and to going to and returning from attendance before courts, etc., were omitted as surplusage and covered by the phrase &ldquo;on official business.&rdquo; Language relating to Standardized Government Travel Regulations was also omitted as the reference in this section is to the provision in the Subsistence Expense Act, supra, authorizing those regulations. Verification under oath provision was omitted as covered by section 553 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title which simplifies procedure by requiring payment upon certification by the payee. The penal provisions of title 18 are ample protection against fraud and an oath alone is no deterrent.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the marshals should include such payments in their accounts for auditing and allowance, was omitted as unnecessary. See section 541 et seq. [now section 561 et seq.] of this title and section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to supervise the accounts of &ldquo;district&rdquo; attorneys, marshals, clerks, and other court officers. The language of this section covers that requirement. The provision as to marshals is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Quarterly expense accounts were required of United States attorneys and marshals by section 586 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such provision is omitted as unnecessary in view of this section and section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Further provisions of said section 586 that office expenses of United States attorneys, assistants, and marshals should be allowed under regulations of the Attorney General and verified under oath, are simplified by this section and section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Another provision that accounts therefor should be submitted to, examined by the district court and, when approved by the court then audited and allowed by law, was omitted. The power of the Attorney General is sufficient. The reference to audit and allowance was unnecessary as covered by section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance. Said section 586 applied also to marshals and deputies and those provisions are incorporated in section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception in sections 586 and 591 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the former should not apply in Alaska was omitted as unnecessary. Section 114 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, requires travel expense accounts to be rendered and paid as in other districts.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerks and messengers in the office of United States attorney, southern district of New York. Section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerical assistants for all United States attorneys. It was not affected by section 678 of title 5 U.S.C. 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, according to a Department of Justice interpretation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision of said section 593 for office expenses of United States attorneys is covered by section 509 [now 549] of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 593 also required that payment of salaries of such clerks and messengers be made by the disbursing clerk of the Department of Justice.

<p class="note-body">The provision in such section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the need for clerical assistants be certified by the district judge, was omitted as unnecessary. The need may be determined by the Attorney General.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The Attorney General shall not base a determination under this chapter that information with respect to a violation of criminal law by a person is not specific and from a credible source upon a determination that such person lacked the state of mind required for the violation of criminal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Attorney General shall not base a determination under this chapter that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted, upon a determination that such person lacked the state of mind required for the violation of criminal law involved, unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the person lacked such state of mind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Extension of time for preliminary investigation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General may apply to the division of the court for a single extension, for a period of not more than 60 days, of the 90-day period referred to in paragraph (1). The division of the court may, upon a showing of good cause, grant such extension.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determination That Further Investigation Not Warranted.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notification of division of the court</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Attorney General, upon completion of a preliminary investigation under this chapter, determines that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted, the Attorney General shall promptly so notify the division of the court, and the division of the court shall have no power to appoint an independent counsel with respect to the matters involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the 90-day period referred to in subsection (a)(1), and any extension granted under subsection (a)(3), have elapsed and the Attorney General has not filed a notification with the division of the court under subsection (b)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In determining under this chapter whether reasonable grounds exist to warrant further investigation, the Attorney General shall comply with the written or other established policies of the Department of Justice with respect to the conduct of criminal investigations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Receipt of additional information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after submitting a notification under subsection (b)(1), the Attorney General receives additional information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate the matters to which such notification related, the Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or as is deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes, no officer or employee of the Department of Justice or an office of independent counsel may, without leave of the division of the court, disclose to any individual outside the Department of Justice or such office any notification, application, or any other document, materials, or memorandum supplied to the division of the court under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing the withholding of information from the Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Judicial Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General's determination under this chapter to apply to the division of the court for the appointment of an independent counsel shall not be reviewable in any court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>By judiciary committee or members thereof</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Committee on the Judiciary of either House of the Congress, or a majority of majority party members or a majority of all nonmajority party members of either such committee, may request in writing that the Attorney General apply for the appointment of an independent counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Report by attorney general pursuant to request</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after the receipt of a request under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall submit, to the committee making the request, or to the committee on which the persons making the request serve, a report on whether the Attorney General has begun or will begin a preliminary investigation under this chapter of the matters with respect to which the request is made, in <!-- PDFPage:217 -->accordance with subsection (a) or (c) of section 591, as the case may be. The report shall set forth the reasons for the Attorney General's decision regarding such preliminary investigation as it relates to each of the matters with respect to which the congressional request is made. If there is such a preliminary investigation, the report shall include the date on which the preliminary investigation began or will begin.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Submission of information in response to congressional request</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the same time as any notification, application, or any other document, material, or memorandum is supplied to the division of the court pursuant to this section with respect to a preliminary investigation of any matter with respect to which a request is made under paragraph (1), such notification, application, or other document, material, or memorandum shall be supplied to the committee making the request, or to the committee on which the persons making the request serve. If no application for the appointment of an independent counsel is made to the division of the court under this section pursuant to such a preliminary investigation, the Attorney General shall submit a report to that committee stating the reasons why such application was not made, addressing each matter with respect to which the congressional request was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any report, notification, application, or other document, material, or memorandum supplied to a committee under this subsection shall not be revealed to any third party, except that the committee may, either on its own initiative or upon the request of the Attorney General, make public such portion or portions of such report, notification, application, document, material, or memorandum as will not in the committee's judgment prejudice the rights of any individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon receipt of an application under section 592(c), the division of the court shall appoint an appropriate independent counsel and shall define that independent counsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Qualifications of independent counsel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The division of the court shall appoint as independent counsel an individual who has appropriate experience and who will conduct the investigation and any prosecution in a prompt, responsible, and cost-effective manner.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Vacancies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a vacancy in office arises by reason of the resignation, death, or removal of an independent counsel, the division of the court shall appoint an independent counsel to complete the work of the independent counsel whose resignation, death, or removal caused the vacancy, except that in the case of a vacancy arising by reason of the removal of an independent counsel, the division of the court may appoint an acting independent counsel to serve until any judicial review of such removal is completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Award of fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the request of an individual who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel pursuant to this chapter, the division of the court may, if no indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation, award reimbursement for those reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred by that individual during that investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Grounds for removal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An independent counsel appointed under this chapter may be removed from office, other than by impeachment and conviction, only by the personal action of the Attorney General and only for good cause, physical or mental disability (if not prohibited by law protecting persons from discrimination on the basis of such a disability),,<sup><a href="#596_1_target" name="596_1">1</a></sup> or any other condition that substantially impairs the performance of such independent counsel's duties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Report to division of the court and congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an independent counsel is removed from office, the Attorney General shall promptly submit to the division of the court and the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report specifying the facts found and the ultimate grounds for such removal. The committees shall make available to the public such report, except that each committee may, if necessary to protect the rights of any individual named in the report or to prevent undue interference with any pending prosecution, postpone or refrain from publishing any or all of the report. The division of the court may release any or all of such report in accordance with section 594(h)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Judicial review of removal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An independent counsel removed from office may obtain judicial review of the removal in a civil action commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. A member of the division of the court may not hear or determine any such civil action or any appeal of a decision in any such civil action. The independent counsel may be reinstated or granted other appropriate relief by order of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Office.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Termination by action of independent counsel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An office of independent counsel shall terminate when&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the independent counsel files a final report in compliance with section 594(h)(1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Termination by division of the court</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The division of the court, either on its own motion or upon the request of the Attorney General, may terminate an office of independent counsel at any time, on the ground that the investigation of all matters within the prosecutorial jurisdiction of such independent counsel or accepted by such independent counsel under section 594(e), and any resulting prosecutions, have been completed or so substantially completed that it would be appropriate for the Department of Justice to complete such investigations and prosecutions. At the time of such termination, the independent counsel shall file the final report required by section 594(h)(1)(B). If the Attorney General has not made a request under this paragraph, the division of the court shall determine on its own motion whether termination is appropriate under this paragraph no later than 2 years after the appointment of an independent counsel, at the end of the succeeding 2-year period, and thereafter at the end of each succeeding 1-year period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Audits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On or before June 30 of each year, an independent counsel shall prepare a statement of expenditures for the 6 months that ended on the immediately preceding March 31.
