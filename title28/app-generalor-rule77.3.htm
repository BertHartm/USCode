<h3 class="section-head">Rule 77.3. Withdrawal of Papers, Exhibits</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Withdrawal for Trial.</strong> The reporter engaged to transcribe the evidence may temporarily withdraw all papers and exhibits for use during any trial session. All exhibits admitted into evidence or designated to accompany the transcript shall remain in the reporter's custody until the transcript of the court session is filed with the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Withdrawal of Papers and Exhibits.</strong> No papers or exhibits filed with the court shall be temporarily or permanently withdrawn from the office or custody of the clerk except by order of the court. No such order will be entered except in extraordinary circumstances. In the event of such withdrawal, a record of the filing and the order of withdrawal shall be preserved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Disposition of Physical Exhibits.</strong> All physical exhibits, including models, diagrams, depositions, transcripts, briefs, tables, and charts shall be removed from the clerk's custody by the party by whom they were produced or offered within sixty (60) days after the entry of final judgment by this court, or, in the event of an appeal, within ninety (90) days after the receipt and filing of a mandate or other process or certificate showing the disposition of the case by the appellate court; otherwise, such exhibits shall be deemed abandoned and shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Sealed Materials.</strong> Unless otherwise specified by order, no earlier than five years after the entry of final judgment by this court, or, in the event of appeal, within five years after the receipt and filing of a mandate or other process or certificate showing disposition of the case by the appellate court, the clerk may notify the parties that materials maintained under seal shall be unsealed, absent timely notice of objection by either party.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule has no FRCP counterpart. The rule has been amended in several respects:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, former subdivision (a) was deleted, thereby eliminating the practice of permitting temporary withdrawal of exhibits and papers by the parties. The need to accommodate the copying of extensive parts of a record should be addressed directly through arrangements made by the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a), formerly subdivision (b), was amended to clarify that the reporter is to retain custody of <!-- PDFPage:444 -->the transcript and exhibits until they are filed with the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (b), formerly subdivision (c), clarifies that no withdrawal of papers or exhibits from the clerk's office may occur in the absence of a court order, and then only in extraordinary circumstances. The fact of withdrawal shall be preserved in the court's docketing entries.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (c), formerly subdivision (d), was rewritten to clarify the practice with respect to the disposition of physical exhibits and to make clear the parties&rsquo; obligation to retrieve such exhibits, to avoid their loss through routine disposal. The reference to <em>in camera</em> materials was omitted, because such materials are not filed with the Office of the Clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (d) establishes a procedure for handling materials filed under seal, requiring the parties affirmatively to indicate a desire to maintain filings in closed cases under seal.</p>
