<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Rules.</strong> The United States Court of Federal Claims, acting by a majority of its judges, may, after giving appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment, make and amend rules governing its practice. Such rules, to the extent permitted by this court's jurisdiction, shall be consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A rule takes effect on the date specified by the court and remains in effect unless amended by the court. Copies of rules and amendments shall be made available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedures When There is no Controlling Law.</strong> A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law or rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2072, or 2503(b). No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for non-compliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or these rules, unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 83.1. Attorneys</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Attorneys Eligible to Practice.</strong> Only attorneys who are members of the bar of this court and who comply with these rules may enter an appearance, file pleadings, and practice in this court, provided that any attorney admitted to practice before the highest court of any state, territory, possession or the District of Columbia may participate <em>pro hac vice</em> in any proceeding at the request of and in the presence of the attorney of record for a party to the proceeding, or otherwise with the approval of the court. All attorneys who were members in good standing of the bar of the United States Court of Claims are eligible to practice herein. See RCFC 83.1(c)(2) concerning authorization to sign filings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Admission to Practice.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Qualifications; Oath.</strong> Any person of good moral character who has been admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the highest court of any state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia, and is in good standing therein, may be admitted to practice before this court upon oral motion or by verified application, as provided in this rule, and upon taking or subscribing to the following oath: I, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and that I will conduct myself in an upright manner as an attorney of this court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Upon Oral Motion.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A) In Washington, D.C.</strong> An oral motion for admission may be made by a member of the bar of this court before any judge, and the judge or the clerk shall administer the oath. Motions for admission will be heard the first Thursday of each month which is not a legal holiday as defined by RCFC 6(a). Where the first Thursday of the month falls on a legal holiday, admissions will be held on the second Thursday of the month. Applicants for admission must appear in the clerk's office no later than 9:30 a.m. to pay the admission fee and fill out the necessary papers. Motions will be heard promptly at 10:00 a.m., in Courtroom No. 4, Room 501, National Courts Building, 717 Madison Place, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Applicants who for special reasons are unable to appear for admission on the first Thursday of the month should contact the Office of the Clerk to make appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B) Outside Washington, D.C.</strong> An oral motion for admission may be made by a member of the bar of this court before a judge outside Washington, D.C., who shall administer the oath. As a preliminary to the motion, the attorney who moves the admission shall submit to the judge the appropriate form obtained from the judge and completed <!-- PDFPage:446 -->by the applicant. In the absence of an oral motion for admission in conformity with this subdivision, the applicant may advise the judge of the applicant's qualifications as set forth in subdivision (b)(1). Upon consideration thereof, and upon representation by the attorney that such attorney will promptly apply to the clerk for admission by verified application as provided in subdivision (b)(3), the judge may permit the applicant to participate in the particular proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) By Verified Application.</strong> Without need for appearing in person, admission may be made upon presentation to the clerk of a verified application showing that the applicant is possessed of the qualifications described in subdivision (b)(1). See Appendix of Forms, Form 1. The application shall be accompanied by: (A) a certificate of a judge or of the clerk of any of the courts specified in subdivision (b)(1) indicating that the applicant is a member of the bar of such court and is in good standing therein; (B) two letters or signed statements of members of the bar of this court or of the Supreme Court of the United States, not related to the applicant, affirming that the applicant is personally known to them, that the applicant possesses all the qualifications required for admission to the bar of this court, that they have examined the application, and that the applicant's personal and professional character and standing are good; and (C) an oath in the form prescribed in subdivision (b)(1) signed by the applicant and administered by an officer authorized to administer oaths in the state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia, where the oath is administered, or as permitted by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Fee for Admission.</strong> Unless the applicant is an attorney representing the United States before this court, an admission fee as provided for in RCFC 77.1 (c)(2) shall be paid in advance in cash or by check payable to &ldquo;Clerk, United States Court of Federal Claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Admission of Foreign Attorneys.</strong> An attorney, barrister, or advocate who is qualified to practice in the highest court of any foreign state may be specially admitted for purposes limited to a particular case. Such attorney, barrister or advocate shall not, however, be authorized to act as attorney of record. In the case of such applicants, the oath shall not be required and there shall be no fee. Such admission shall be only on written motion of a member of the bar of this court, filed with the clerk at least 3 days prior to the consideration of the motion by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Attorneys of Record.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) One for Each Party.</strong> There shall be but one attorney of record for a party in any case at any one time, and such attorney of record shall be an individual (and not a firm) who has been admitted to practice before this court. Any other attorneys assisting the attorney of record shall be designated as &ldquo;of counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Authorization to Sign Filings.</strong> Any attorney who is a member of the bar of this court may sign any filing in the attorney of record's name. An attorney who signs the name of the attorney of record shall so indicate by adding the following after the name of the attorney of record: &ldquo;by [the signing attorney's full name].&rdquo; Authorization to sign filings shall not relieve the attorney of record from the provisions of RCFC 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Appearance.</strong> For parties other than the United States, the attorney of record shall include on the initial pleading or paper said attorney's name, address, telephone, and facsimile number. For the United States the attorney who is to appear as the attorney of record shall, promptly after service of the complaint, file with the clerk and serve on all other parties a notice of appearance setting forth the identical information. The attorneys of record for all parties shall promptly file with the clerk and serve on all other parties a notice of any change in address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Change by Parties Other than the United States.</strong> A party other than the United States may by leave of court on motion change the party's attorney at any time. The motion may be signed by said party in person or by the newly designated attorney accompanied by an affidavit of appointment executed by such attorney. If the consent of the previous attorney of record is annexed to or endorsed on the motion, substitution shall be accomplished by an appropriate entry on the docket by the clerk. When the motion is not thus shown to have the consent of the previous attorney, such attorney shall be served with the motion, and shall have 14 days to show cause why the motion should not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Change by the United States.</strong> A new notice of appearance shall be filed and served on all parties by the United States whenever a case is reassigned to another attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Withdrawal of Attorney.</strong> No attorney of record for a plaintiff or a third party may withdraw such attorney's appearance except by leave of the court on motion and after notice is served on such attorney's client.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7) Death of Attorney.</strong> If the attorney of record dies, a suggestion of such attorney's death shall be made, and a motion to substitute another attorney admitted to practice before this court may be made by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(8) Unrepresented Party.</strong> An individual may represent oneself or a member of one's immediate family as a party before the court. Any other party, however, must be represented by an attorney who is admitted to practice in this court. A corporation may only be represented by counsel. The terms counsel or attorney in these rules shall include unrepresented parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Honorary Membership.</strong> Honorary membership in the bar of the court may be granted from time to time to distinguished professionals of the United States or of other nations who are knowledgeable in the affairs of law and government in their respective countries. After nomination by the chief judge and approval by the court, the candidate for honorary membership will be presented at the bar in person. A certificate of honorary membership in the bar will be presented to the person so honored.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule has no FRCP counterpart. Former RCFC 83.1 (&ldquo;Content of Briefs or Memoranda; Length of Briefs or Memoranda&rdquo;) has been renumbered as RCFC 5.2. The renumbering of RCFC 83.1 was intended to reflect its more logical placement in the organizational structure of this court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The substance of the rule reflects the text of former RCFC 81, as modified. Paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) (formerly paragraph (d)(2) of RCFC 81) was amended to formalize the court's practice of allowing joint filings to be signed by one counsel, on behalf of both counsel, when authorized to do so by opposing counsel. Also, subdivision (e) of former RCFC 81 (relating to attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses) was not retained as part of this rule but was, instead, incorporated into RCFC 54(d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, former General Order No. 15, &ldquo;Honorary Bar Membership,&rdquo; was slightly modified and moved to new subdivision 83.1(d).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 83.2. Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement.</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Court of Federal Claims, in furtherance of its inherent power and responsibility to supervise the conduct of attorneys who are admitted to practice before it, or admitted for the purpose of a particular proceeding pursuant to RCFC 83.1(a) and (b)(5), promulgates the following Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement superseding all of its other rules pertaining to disciplinary enforcement heretofore promulgated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Attorneys Convicted of Crimes.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Upon the filing with the court of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction demonstrating that any attorney admitted to practice before the court has been convicted in any court of the United States, or the District of Columbia, or of any state, territory, commonwealth or possession of the United States of a serious crime as hereinafter defined, the court shall enter an order immediately suspending that attorney, whether the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or from a verdict after trial or otherwise, and regardless of the pendency of any appeal, until final disposition of a disciplinary proceeding to be commenced upon such conviction. A copy of such order shall immediately be served upon the attorney. Upon good cause shown, the court may set aside such order when it appears in the interest of justice so to do.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The term serious crime shall include any felony and any lesser crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of such crime in the jurisdiction where the judgment was entered, involves false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, willful failure to file income tax returns, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or an attempt or a conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a serious crime.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> A certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for any crime shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against that attorney based upon the conviction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for a serious crime, the court shall, in addition to suspending that attorney in accordance with the provisions of this rule, refer the matter to counsel for the institution of a disciplinary proceeding before the court in which the sole issue to be determined shall be the extent of the final discipline to be imposed as a result of the conduct resulting in the conviction, provided that a disciplinary proceeding so instituted will not be brought to final hearing until all appeals from the conviction are concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for a crime not constituting a serious crime, the court may refer the matter to counsel for whatever action counsel may deem warranted, including the institution of a disciplinary proceeding before the court; provided, however, that the court may in its discretion make no reference with respect to convictions for minor offenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> An attorney suspended under the provisions of this rule will be reinstated immediately upon the filing of a certificate demonstrating that the underlying conviction of a serious crime has been reversed, but the reinstatement will not terminate any disciplinary proceeding then pending against the attorney, the disposition of which shall be determined by the court on the basis of all available evidence pertaining to both guilt and the extent of discipline to be imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discipline Imposed by Other Courts; Disbarment on Consent or Representation in Other Courts.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court shall, upon being subjected to public discipline by any other court of the United States or District of Columbia, or by a court of any state, territory, commonwealth or possession of the United States, promptly inform the clerk of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court shall, upon being disbarred on consent or resigning from the bar of any other court of the United States or the District of Columbia, or from the bar of any state, territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States while an investigation into allegations of misconduct is pending, promptly inform the clerk of such disbarment on consent or resignation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment or order demonstrating that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been disciplined by another court or upon accepting disbarment on consent or resignation, the court shall forthwith issue a notice directed to the attorney containing: a copy of the judgment or order from the other court or a copy of the communication indicating disbarment on consent or resignation; and an order to show cause directing that the attorney inform the court within 30 days after service of that order upon the attorney, personally or by mail of any claim by the attorney predicated upon the grounds set forth in paragraph (5), and that the imposition of the identical discipline by the court would be unwarranted and the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> In the event the discipline imposed in the other jurisdiction has been stayed there, any <!-- PDFPage:448 -->reciprocal discipline imposed in the court shall be deferred until such stay expires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> Upon the expiration of 30 days from service of the notice issued pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (3), the court shall impose the identical discipline unless the respondent-attorney demonstrates, or the court finds, that upon the face of the record upon which the discipline in another jurisdiction is predicated it clearly appears:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> that the procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> or that there was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that the court could not, consistent with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on that subject;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> or that the imposition of the same discipline by the court would result in grave injustice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> or that the misconduct established is deemed by the court to warrant substantially different discipline.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">Where the court determines that any of said elements exist, it shall enter such other order as it deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> In all other respects, a final adjudication in another court that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct shall establish conclusively the misconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> The court may at any stage appoint counsel to prosecute the disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Standards for Professional Conduct.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> For misconduct defined in this rule and after notice and opportunity to be heard, any attorney admitted to practice before the court may be disbarred, suspended from practice before the court, publicly reprimanded, or subjected to such other disciplinary action as the circumstances may warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Acts or omissions by an attorney admitted to practice before the court, individually or in concert with any other person or persons, which violate the Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by the court shall constitute misconduct and shall be grounds for discipline, whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship. The Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by the court is the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, as amended from time to time by the Association, except as otherwise provided by specific rule of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Disciplinary Proceedings</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> When misconduct or allegations of misconduct which, if substantiated, would warrant discipline on the part of an attorney admitted to practice before the court shall come to the attention of a judge or special master of the court, whether by complaint or otherwise, and the applicable procedure is not otherwise mandated by this rule, the judge or special master shall refer the matter to the chief judge for determination whether the matter should be referred to a disciplinary judge for a formal disciplinary proceeding or the formulation of such other recommendation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Should the disciplinary judge conclude after review that a formal disciplinary proceeding should not be initiated against the respondent-attorney because sufficient evidence is not present, or because there is pending another proceeding against the respondent-attorney the disposition of which in the judgment of the disciplinary judge should be awaited before further action by the court is considered or for any other valid reason, the disciplinary judge shall file with the court a recommendation for disposition of the matter, whether by dismissal, admonition, deferral, or otherwise setting forth the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> To initiate formal disciplinary proceedings, the disciplinary judge shall file an order of the court upon a showing of probable cause requiring the respondent-attorney to show cause within 30 days after service of that order upon that attorney, personally, or by mail, why the attorney should not be disciplined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Upon the respondent-attorney's answer to the order to show cause, if any issue of fact is raised or the respondent-attorney wishes to be heard in mitigation, the disciplinary judge shall set the matter for prompt hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Disbarment on Consent While Under Disciplinary Investigation or Prosecution</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court who is the subject of an investigation into or a pending proceeding involving allegations of misconduct may consent to disbarment, but only by delivering to the court an affidavit stating that the attorney desires to consent to disbarment and that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the attorney's consent is freely and voluntarily rendered; the attorney is not being subjected to coercion or duress; the attorney is fully aware of the implications of so consenting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the attorney is aware that there is a presently pending investigation or proceeding involving allegations that there exist grounds for the attorney's discipline the nature of which the attorney shall specifically set forth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> the attorney acknowledges that the material facts so alleged are true; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> the attorney so consents because the attorney knows that if charges were predicated upon the matters under investigation, or if the proceeding were prosecuted, the attorney could not successfully defend himself.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Upon receipt of the required affidavit, the court shall enter an order disbarring the attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The order disbarring the attorney on consent shall be a matter of public record. However, the affidavit required under the provisions of this rule shall not be publicly disclosed or made available for use in any other proceeding except upon order of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Reinstatement.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) After Disbarment or Suspension.</strong> An attorney suspended for three months or less shall be automatically reinstated at the end of the period of suspension upon the filing with the court of an affidavit of compliance with <!-- PDFPage:449 -->the provisions of the order. An attorney suspended for more than three months or disbarred may not resume practice until reinstated by order of the court, except as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Time of Application Following Disbarment.</strong> A person who has been disbarred after hearing or by consent may not apply for reinstatement until the expiration of at least one year from the effective day of the disbarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Hearing on Application.</strong> Petitions for reinstatement by a disbarred or suspended attorney under this rule shall be filed with the Clerk, and directed to the chief judge of the court. Such petitions shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner has the moral qualifications, competency and learning in the law before the court and that the petitioner's resumption to the practice of law will not be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the bar or to the administration of justice, or subversive of the public interest. Upon receipt of the petition, the chief judge shall promptly assign the petition to one or more judges of the court for prompt action. The judge or judges assigned to the matter shall within 30 days after referral issue an order of reinstatement based upon the petition or, schedule a hearing at which the petitioner shall have the burden of demonstrating the elements listed above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Deposit for Costs of Proceeding.</strong> The court may direct that petitions for reinstatement under this rule shall be accompanied by an advance cost deposit in an amount to be set from time to time by the court to cover anticipated costs of the reinstatement proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Conditions of Reinstatement.</strong> If the petitioner is found unfit to resume the practice of law, the petition shall be dismissed. If the petitioner is found fit to resume the practice of law, the judgment shall reinstate the petitioner, provided that the judgment may make reinstatement conditional upon the payment of all or part of the costs of the proceedings, and upon the making of partial or complete restitution to parties harmed by the petitioner whose conduct led to the suspension or disbarment. Provided further, that if the petitioner has been suspended or disbarred for 5 years or more, reinstatement may be conditioned, in the discretion of the judge or judges before whom the matter is heard, upon the furnishing of proof of competency and learning in law, which proof may include certification by the bar examiners of a state or other jurisdiction of the attorney's successful completion of an examination for admission to practice subsequent to the date of suspension or disbarment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an attorney applies to be admitted or is admitted to the court for purposes of a particular proceeding pursuant to RCFC 83.1(a) or(b)(5), the attorney shall be deemed thereby to have conferred disciplinary jurisdiction upon the court for any alleged misconduct of that attorney arising in the course of or in the preparation for such proceeding.</p>

Counsel, once appointed, may not resign unless permission to do so is given by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(j) Payment of Fees and Costs.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">At the conclusion of any disciplinary investigation or prosecution, if any, under this rule, counsel may make application to the court for an order awarding reasonable fees and reimbursing costs expended in the course of such disciplinary investigation or prosecution. Any such order shall be submitted to the clerk who shall pay the amount required thereunder from the funds collected pursuant to subdivision (j).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(k) Duties of the Clerk.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Upon being informed that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been convicted of any crime, the clerk shall determine whether the clerk of the convicting court has forwarded a certificate of such conviction to the court.
