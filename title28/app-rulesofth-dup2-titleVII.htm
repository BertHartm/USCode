<h3 class="section-head">Rule 54. Judgments</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Definition&mdash;Form. &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Demand for Judgment. A judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment. Except as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party's pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Attorney's Fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Claims for attorney's fees and related non-taxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive law governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court, the motion must be filed and served no later than 14 days after entry of judgment; must specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the moving party to the award; and must state the amount <!-- PDFPage:461 -->or provide a fair estimate of the amount sought. If directed by the court, the motion shall also disclose the terms of any agreement with respect to fees to be paid for the services for which claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On request of a party or class member, the court shall afford an opportunity for adversary submissions with respect to the motion. The court may determine issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions bearing on issues of evaluation of services for which liability is imposed by the court. The court shall find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in USCIT R. 52(a), and a judgment shall be set forth in a separate document as provided in USCIT R. 58.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) By court rules, the court may establish special procedures by which issues relating to such fees may be resolved without extensive evidentiary hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (4) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violations of these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 55. Default</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Entry. When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as prescribed by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party's default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Judgment. Judgment by default may be entered as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In all cases the party entitled to a judgment by default shall apply to the court therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">When the plaintiff's claim against a defendant is for a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain, the court upon request of the plaintiff and upon affidavit of the amount due shall enter judgment for that amount against the defendant, if the defendant has been defaulted for failure to appear and is not an infant or incompetent person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action, the party (or, if appearing by representative, the party's representative) shall be served with 10-days written notice of the application for judgment. If, in order to enable the court to enter judgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of damages or to establish the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an investigation of any other matter, the court may conduct such hearings or order such references as it deems necessary and proper and shall accord a right of trial by jury to the parties when and as required by any statute of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Setting Aside Default. For good cause shown, the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside as prescribed by Rule 60(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Plaintiffs, Counterclaimants, Cross-Claimants. The provisions of this rule apply whether the party entitled to the judgment by default is a plaintiff, a third-party plaintiff, or a party who has pleaded a cross-claim or counterclaim. In all cases a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of Rule 54(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Judgment Against the United States. No judgment by default shall be entered against the United States or an officer or agency thereof unless the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.</p>

<!-- field-start:head -->
<h3 class="section-head">Rule 56. Summary Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For Claimant. A party seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim or cross-claim, or to obtain a declaratory judgment, may, at any time after the expiration of the initial time within which to file an answer or after service of a motion for summary judgment by the adverse party, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in the party's favor upon all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For Defending Party. A party against whom a claim, counterclaim or cross-claim is asserted, or a declaratory judgment is sought, may, at any time after the filing of a complaint, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in the party's favor as to all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When Leave Is Required. A motion for summary judgment may not be filed by any party, except by order of the court upon motion, (1) after the action has been set for trial, or (2) after the filing of a stipulation of the parties or a pretrial memorandum containing all of the material facts, or (3) after the filing of his response to a motion for summary judgment by an adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Motion and Proceedings Thereon. A hearing upon a motion may be requested as prescribed by Rule 7(c). The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on Motion. If on motion under this rule judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel, shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Form of Affidavits&mdash;Further Testimony&mdash;Defense Required. Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that <!-- PDFPage:462 -->the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith, except that all papers and documents which are part of the official record of the action pursuant to Title IX of these rules may be referred to in an affidavit without attaching copies, and shall be considered by the court without additional certification. The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) When Affidavits Are Unavailable. Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Affidavits Made in Bad Faith. Should it appear to the satisfaction of the court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this rule are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order the party employing them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any offending party or attorney may be adjudged guilty of contempt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Annexation of Statement. Upon any motion for summary judgment, there shall be annexed to the motion a separate, short and concise statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried. The papers opposing a motion for summary judgment shall include a separate, short and concise statement of the material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried. All material facts set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement required to be served by the opposing party.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Motion for Judgment. After issue is joined in any action in which a party believes that the determination of the court is to be made solely upon the basis of the record made before an agency, that party may move for judgment in its favor upon all or any part of the agency determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Cross-Motions. When a motion for judgment upon an agency record is filed by a party, an opposing party shall not file a cross-motion for judgment upon an agency record.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The issues of law presented together with the reasons for contesting or supporting the administrative determination, specifying how the determination may be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not otherwise in accordance with law, unsupported by substantial evidence; or, how the determination may be unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the agency may or may not have considered facts which, as a matter of law, should or should not have been properly considered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The brief shall include the authorities relied upon and the conclusions of law deemed warranted by the authorities. All references to the administrative record shall be made by citing the portions of the record to the factual or legal issues raised.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Time to Respond. A response to a motion for judgment upon an agency record shall be served within 30 days after service of the motion. The moving party shall have 10 days after service of the response to the motion to serve a reply. No other papers or briefs shall be allowed, except by leave of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Hearing. Upon motion of a party, or upon its own initiative, the court may direct oral argument on a motion for judgment upon an agency record at a time and place designated as prescribed in Rule 77(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Partial Judgment. After considering a motion filed under this rule, the court may grant judgment in whole or in part in favor of any party.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Proposed Briefing Schedule and Joint Status Report. The judge may modify the fol<!-- PDFPage:463 -->lowing procedures as appropriate in the circumstances of the action, or the parties may suggest modification of these procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Any proposed judicial protective order shall be filed within 30 days after the date of service of the complaint. Prior to the filing of the proposed judicial protective order, the moving party shall consult with all other parties to the action in accordance with Rule 7(b) regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed judicial protective order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Any motion to intervene as of right shall be filed within the time and in the manner prescribed by Rule 24.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Any motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the liquidation of entries that are the subject of the action shall be filed by a party to the action within 30 days after the date of service of the complaint, or at such later time, for good cause shown. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph, an intervenor shall file a motion for a preliminary injunction no earlier than the date of filing of its motion to intervene and no later than 30 days after the date of service of the order granting intervention, or at such later time, but only for good cause shown. Prior to the filing of the motion, the moving party shall consult with all other parties to the action in accordance with Rule 7(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">No later than 30 days after the filing of the record with the court, the parties, including proposed intervenors, shall file with the clerk (1) a Joint Status Report, and (2) a proposed briefing schedule. The Joint Status Report shall be signed by counsel for all parties and shall set forth answers to the following questions, although separate views may be set forth on any point on which the parties cannot agree:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">1. Does the court have jurisdiction over the action?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">2. Should the case be consolidated with any other case, or should any portion of the case be severed, and the reasons therefor?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">3. Should further proceedings in this case be deferred pending consideration of another case before the court or any other tribunal and the reasons therefor?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">4. Are there any outstanding issues concerning the issuance of a judicial protective order?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">5. Is there any other information of which the court should be aware at this time?</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The proposed briefing schedule shall indicate whether the parties (1) agree to the time periods set forth in Rule 56.2(d), (2) agree to time periods other than the periods set forth in Rule 56.2(d), or (3) cannot agree upon a time period. In the event the parties cannot agree upon a time period, the parties shall indicate the areas of disagreement and shall set forth the reasons for their respective positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">After the Joint Status Report and proposed briefing schedule are filed, the judge promptly shall enter a scheduling order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Cross-Motions. When a motion for judgment upon an agency record is filed by a party, an opposing party shall not file a cross-motion for judgment upon an agency record. If the court determines that judgment should be entered in favor of an opposing party, it may enter judgment in favor of that party, notwithstanding the absence of a cross-motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Briefs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to the other requirements prescribed by these rules, the briefs submitted on the motion, either contesting or supporting the agency determination, shall include a statement setting forth in numbered paragraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the administrative determination sought to be reviewed with appropriate reference to the Federal Register; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the issues of law presented together with the reasons for contesting or supporting the administrative determination, specifying how the determination may be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not otherwise in accordance with law, unsupported by substantial evidence; or, how the determination may be unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the agency may or may not have considered facts which, as a matter of law, should have been properly considered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The brief shall include the authorities relied upon and the conclusions of law deemed warranted by the authorities. All references to the administrative record shall be made by citing the portions of the record to the factual or legal issues raised. Citations shall be by page number of the transcript, if any, and by specific identification of exhibits together with the relevant page number. The brief also shall include a table of contents, a table of authorities and an appendix containing a copy of those portions of the record cited in the brief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Time to Respond. Unless the scheduling order otherwise provides, a motion for judgment upon an agency record shall be served within 60 days after the date of service of the scheduling order. Responsive briefs shall be served within 60 days after the date of service of the brief of the moving party. The moving party shall have 25 days after service of the response to the motion to serve a reply. No other papers or briefs shall be allowed, except by leave of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Hearing. Upon motion of a party, subject to the time limitations set forth in Rule 7(c), or upon its own initiative, the court may direct oral argument on a motion for judgment upon an agency record at a time and place designated in Rule 77(c). The moving party, after consultation with all other parties to the action, shall request a hearing date that is not more than 30 days after the date of service of the reply memorandum, except for good cause shown as to why the hearing should be scheduled on a later date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Partial Judgment. After considering a motion filed under this rule, the court may grant judgment in whole or in part in favor of any party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Voluntary Dismissal&mdash;Time Limitation.

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 59. New Trials&mdash;Rehearings&mdash;Amendment of Judgments</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Grounds. A new trial or rehearing may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues (1) in an action in which there has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States; and (2) in an action tried without a jury or in an action finally determined, for any of the reasons for which rehearings have heretofore been granted in suits in equity in the courts of the United States. On a motion for a new trial in an action tried without a jury, the court may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Time for Motion. A motion for a new trial or rehearing shall be served and filed not later than 30 days after the entry of the judgment or order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Time for Serving Affidavits. When a motion for a new trial or rehearing is based upon affidavits they shall be served with the motion. The opposing party has 10 days after such service within which to serve opposing affidavits, which period may be extended for an additional period not exceeding 20 days by order of the court for good cause shown or by the parties by written stipulation. The court may permit reply affidavits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) On Initiative of Court. Not later than 30 days after the entry of the judgment or order the court on its own initiative may order a new trial or rehearing for any reason for which it might have granted a new trial or rehearing on motion of a party. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter, the court may grant a motion for a new trial or rehearing, timely served, for a reason not stated in the motion. In either case, the court shall specify in the order the grounds therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Motion To Alter or Amend a Judgment. A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 30 days after the entry of the judgment.</p>

<p class="note-body">Rule 59(b) provides for a 30-day period within which to move for a new trial or rehearing. In contrast, Rule 59(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for a 10-day period. The lengthier period is required by 28 U.S.C. &sect;2646, a statute not applicable to the district courts.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 60. Relief From Judgment or Order</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Clerical Mistakes. Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative or on motion of a party and after such notice, if any, as the court directs. After an appeal is filed, such mistakes may be corrected with leave of the appellate court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Mistakes, Inadvertence, Excusable Neglect&mdash;Newly Discovered Evidence&mdash;Fraud, Etc. On motion of a party or upon its own initiative and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial or rehearing under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, re<!-- PDFPage:465 -->leased, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">This rule does not limit the power of the court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not actually personally notified as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1655, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court. The procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 62. Stay of Proceedings To Enforce a Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Automatic Stay&mdash;Exceptions&mdash;Injunctions. Except as stated herein or as otherwise ordered by the court, no execution shall issue upon a judgment nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of 30 days after its entry. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction shall not be stayed during the period after its entry and until an appeal is taken or during the pendency of an appeal. The provisions of subdivision (c) of this rule govern the suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting of an injunction during the pendency of an appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Stay on Motion for New Trial or Rehearing, or for Judgment. In its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, the court may stay the execution of a judgment or any proceedings to enforce a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial or rehearing or to alter or amend a judgment made pursuant to Rule 59, or of a motion for relief from a judgment or order made pursuant to Rule 60, or of a motion for judgment in accordance with a motion for a directed verdict made pursuant to Rule 50, or of a motion for amendment to the findings or for additional findings made pursuant to Rule 52(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Injunction Pending Appeal. When an appeal is taken from an interlocutory or final judgment granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction, the court in its discretion may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the adverse party. If the judgment appealed from is rendered by a three-judge panel, no such order shall be made except (1) by such court sitting in open court or (2) by the assent of all judges of such court evidenced by their signatures to the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Stay Upon Appeal. When an appeal is taken, the appellant, by giving a supersedeas bond, may obtain a stay subject to the exception contained in subdivision (a) of this rule. The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the appeal, as the case may be. The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Stay in Favor of the United States or Agency Thereof. When an appeal is taken by the United States or an officer or agency thereof or by direction of any department of the Government of the United States and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall be required from the appellant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Stay According to State Law. In any state in which a judgment is a lien upon the property of the judgment debtor and in which the judgment debtor is entitled to a stay of execution, a judgment debtor is entitled to such stay as would be accorded the judgment debtor had the action been maintained in the courts of that state.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Stay of Judgment as to Multiple Claims or Multiple Parties. When the court has ordered a final judgment under the conditions stated in Rule 54(b), the court may stay enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.</p>
