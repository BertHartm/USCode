<h3 class="section-head">Rule 26. General Provisions Governing Discovery</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Discovery Methods.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property, for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; requests for admission; and calls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discovery Scope and Limits.</strong> Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods set forth in subdivision (a) of this rule shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the limitations on the parties&rsquo; resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. The court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion under subdivision (c) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Trial Preparation: Materials.</em></strong> Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)(3) of this rule, a party may obtain discovery of documents and <!-- PDFPage:387 -->tangible things otherwise discoverable under subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative (including that other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party. Upon request, a person not a party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that person. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement previously made is (A) a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or (B) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>Trial Preparation: Experts.</em></strong> Discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under the provisions of subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be obtained only as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(A)(i)</strong> A party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion. <strong>(ii)</strong> Upon motion, the court may order further discovery by other means, subject to such restrictions as to scope and such provisions, pursuant to subdivision (b)(3)(C) of this rule, concerning fees and expenses as the court may deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> A party may discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial, only as provided in Rule 35(b) or upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> Unless manifest injustice would result: <strong>(i)</strong> the court shall require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery under subdivisions (b)(3)(A)(ii) and (b)(3)(B) of this rule; and <strong>(ii)</strong> with respect to discovery obtained under subdivision (b)(3)(A)(ii) of this rule the court may require, and with respect to discovery obtained under subdivision (b)(3)(B) of this rule the court shall require, the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protective Orders.</strong> Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, see Appendix G 8, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following: <strong>(1)</strong> that the discovery not be had; <strong>(2)</strong> that the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place; <strong>(3)</strong> that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery; <strong>(4)</strong> that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be limited to certain matters; <strong>(5)</strong> that discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court; <strong>(6)</strong> that a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of the court; <strong>(7)</strong> that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; <strong>(8)</strong> that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court. If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Sequence and Timing of Discovery.</strong> Unless the court upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, shall not operate to delay any other party's discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Supplementation of Responses.</strong> A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the party's response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the party's response with respect to any question directly addressed to <strong>(A)</strong> the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and <strong>(B)</strong> the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the expert witness is expected to testify, and the substance of the expert witness&rsquo; testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if the party obtains information upon the basis of which <strong>(A)</strong> the party knows that the response was incorrect when made or <strong>(B)</strong> the party knows that the response though correct when made is no longer true and <!-- PDFPage:388 -->the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Discovery Conference.</strong> At any time after commencement of an action the court may direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for a conference on the subject of discovery. The court may do so upon motion by the attorney for any party if the motion includes:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> A statement of the issues as they then appear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> A proposed plan and schedule of discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> Any limitations proposed to be placed on discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4)</strong> Any other proposed orders with respect to discovery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(5)</strong> A statement showing that the attorney making the motion has made a reasonable effort to reach agreement with opposing attorneys on the matters set forth in the motion. Each party and each party's attorney are under a duty to participate in good faith in the framing of a discovery plan if a plan is proposed by the attorney for any party. Notice of the motion shall be served on all parties. Objections or additions to matters set forth in the motion shall be served not later than 10 days after service of the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Following the discovery conference, the court may enter an order tentatively identifying the issues for discovery purposes, establishing a plan and schedule for discovery, setting limitations on discovery, if any; and determining such other matters, including the allocation of expenses, as are necessary for the proper management of discovery in the action. An order may be altered or amended whenever justice so requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the right of a party who properly moves for a discovery conference to prompt convening of the conference, the court may combine the discovery conference with a pretrial conference authorized by Rule 16.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Signing of Discovery Requests, Responses, and Objections.</strong> Every request for discovery or response or objection thereto made by a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by the attorney of record in such attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign the request, response, or objection and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that the attorney or party has read the request, response, or objection and that to the best of the attorney's or party's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry it is: <strong>(1)</strong> consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; <strong>(2)</strong> not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay, or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and <strong>(3)</strong> not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If a certification is made in violation of these rules, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose behalf the request, response, or objection is made, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 27. Discovery To Perfect Complaint or Pending Appeal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Preliminary Complaint. (1) <em>Complaint.</em></strong> When a plaintiff cannot state a case with the requisite particularity without an examination of documents or things or other information in the possession of the United States, and the plaintiff has been unable upon application to obtain a sufficient examination of such documents or things or other information, such plaintiff may file a complaint stating the plaintiff's claim as far as is in the plaintiff's power. The complaint shall state specifically: (A) that it is filed under this rule; (B) the subject matter of a claim cognizable by this court, with as much particularity as plaintiff can provide; and (C) a description of the documents or things or other information required as definite as plaintiff can provide. Within 30 days after filing such preliminary complaint, plaintiff shall file a motion for leave to take depositions upon oral examination or written questions, to submit requests for admission or written interrogatories, or for production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property for inspection and other purposes, or such combination thereof as may be needed to obtain from the proper department or agency of the United States such documents or things or other information as may be deemed necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Order.</em></strong> If plaintiff's motion is allowed, the court by order shall designate the persons whose depositions may be taken, the subject matter of the examination, and whether the depositions shall be taken on oral examination or written interrogatories. The order shall specify the extent of other discovery permitted, and a date for completion of all discovery thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>Amended Complaint.</em></strong> Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint within 30 days after the discovery has been completed. Defendant need not respond to a preliminary complaint filed under this rule, but shall answer or otherwise respond to the amended complaint in accordance with these rules for answering an original complaint. If plaintiff's motion is not allowed, or if an amended complaint is not filed after the requested documents or things or other information is furnished or obtained, defendant shall file such responsive pleading or motion within such time as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pending Appeal.</strong> If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of the court or before <!-- PDFPage:389 -->the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, on motion the court may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in this court. The party who desires to perpetuate the testimony may file a motion for leave to take the depositions that shows <strong>(1)</strong> the names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the party expects to elicit from each and <strong>(2)</strong> the reasons for perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by Rules 34 and 35, and thereupon the depositions may be taken and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in these rules for depositions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Perpetuation by Action.</strong> [Not used.]</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 28. Persons Before Whom Depositions May Be Taken</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Within the United States.</strong> Within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held or before a person appointed by the court. A person so appointed has power to administer oaths and take testimony. The term officer as used in Rules 30, 31 and 32 includes a person appointed by the court or designated by the parties under Rule 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) In Foreign Countries.</strong> In a foreign country, depositions may be taken: <strong>(1)</strong> on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in which the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the United States; or <strong>(2)</strong> before a person commissioned by the court and a person so commissioned shall have the power by virtue of the person's commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony; or <strong>(3)</strong> pursuant to a letter rogatory. A commission or a letter rogatory shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter rogatory that the taking of the deposition in any other manner is impracticable or inconvenient; and both a commission and a letter rogatory may be issued in proper cases. A notice or commission may designate the person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive title. A letter rogatory may be addressed &ldquo;To the Appropriate Authority in [here name the country].&rdquo; Evidence obtained in response to a letter rogatory need not be excluded merely for the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that the testimony was not taken under oath or for any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States under these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Disqualification for Interest.</strong> No deposition shall be taken before a person who is a relative or employee or attorney or counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of such attorney or counsel, or is financially interested in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Fees.</strong> The party at whose instance the deposition is taken shall be responsible for the payment of the officer's fees for taking, transcribing, and returning the deposition.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the court orders otherwise, the parties may by written stipulation <strong>(1)</strong> provide that depositions may be taken before any person, at any time or place, upon any notice, and in any manner and when so taken may be used like other depositions, and <strong>(2)</strong> modify the procedures provided by these rules for other methods of discovery, except that stipulations extending the time provided in Rules 33, 34 and 36 for responses to discovery may be made only with the approval of the court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 30. Depositions upon Oral Examination</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Depositions May Be Taken.</strong> After commencement of the action, any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon oral examination. Leave of court, granted with or without notice, must be obtained only if the plaintiff seeks to take a deposition prior to the expiration of 30 days after service of the complaint upon the United States. Leave is not required <strong>(1)</strong> if the United States has served a notice of taking deposition or otherwise sought discovery, or <strong>(2)</strong> if special notice is given as provided in subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by subpoena as provided in Rule 45. The deposition of a person confined in prison may be taken only by leave of court on such terms as the court prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Notice of Examination: General Requirements; Special Notice; Non-Stenographic Recording; Production of Documents and Things; Deposition of Organization; Deposition by Telephone. (1)</strong> A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination shall give reasonable notice in writing to every other party to the action. The notice shall state the time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the designation of the materials to be produced as set forth in the subpoena shall be attached to or included in the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> Leave of court is not required for the taking of a deposition by the plaintiff if the notice (A) states that the person to be examined is more than 100 miles from the place of trial, or is about to go out of the United States, or is bound on a voyage to sea, and will be unavailable for examination unless the person's deposition is taken before expiration of the 30-day period, and (B) sets forth facts to support the statement. The plaintiff's attorney shall sign the notice, and the attorney's signature constitutes a certification by the attorney that to the best of the attorney's knowledge, information, and belief the statement and supporting facts are true. The sanctions provided by Rule 11 are applicable to the certification.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:390 --><p class="statutory-body">If the party shows that when the party was served with notice under subdivision (b)(2) of this rule the party was unable through the exercise of diligence to obtain counsel to represent the party at the taking of the deposition, the deposition may not be used against the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> The court may for cause shown enlarge or shorten the time for taking the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4)</strong> The parties may stipulate in writing or the court may upon motion order that the testimony at a deposition be recorded by other than stenographic or electronic means. The stipulation or order shall designate the person before whom the deposition shall be taken and the manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition and may include other provisions to ensure that the recorded testimony will be accurate and trustworthy. A party may arrange to have a transcription made at the party's own expense. Any objections under subdivision (c), any changes made by the witness, the witness&rsquo; signature identifying the deposition as the witness&rsquo; own or the statement of the officer that is required if the witness does not sign, as provided in subdivision (e) of this rule, and the certification of the officer required by subdivision (f) of this rule shall be set forth in a writing to accompany a deposition recorded by non-stenographic means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(5)</strong> The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request made in compliance with Rule 34 for the production of documents and tangible things at the taking of the deposition. The procedure of Rule 34 shall apply to the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(6)</strong> A party may in the party's notice and in a subpoena name as the deponent a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency and describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In that event, the organization so named shall designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated, the matters on which each person will testify. A subpoena shall advise a non-party organization of its duty to make such a designation. The persons so designated shall testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the organization. Subdivision (b)(6) of this rule does not preclude taking a deposition by any other procedure authorized in these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(7)</strong> The parties may stipulate in writing or the court may upon motion order that a deposition be taken by telephone. For the purposes of this rule and Rules 28(a), 37(b)(1) and 45, a deposition taken by telephone is taken at the place where the deponent is to answer questions propounded to him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Examination and Cross-Examination; Record of Examination; Oath; Objections.</strong> Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted at the trial under the provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken shall put the witness on oath and shall personally, or by someone acting under the officer's direction and in his presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically or recorded by any other means ordered in accordance with subdivision (b)(4) of this rule. If requested by one of the parties, the testimony shall be transcribed. All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other objection to the proceedings, shall be noted by the officer upon the deposition. Evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition and such party shall transmit them to the officer, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Motion To Terminate or Limit Examination.</strong> At any time during the taking of the deposition, on motion of a party or of the deponent and upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, the court may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the deposition as provided in Rule 26(c). If it is impractical to make such a motion personally or in writing, the moving party or deponent may do so by telephone, provided the opposing party has a fair opportunity to participate. If the order made terminates the examination, it shall be resumed thereafter only upon the order of the court. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition shall be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for an order. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Submission To Witness; Changes; Signing.</strong> When the testimony is fully transcribed the deposition shall be submitted to the witness for examination and shall be read to or by the witness, unless such examination and reading are waived by the witness and by the parties. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The deposition shall then be signed by the witness, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness within 30 days of submission to the witness, the officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed unless on a motion to suppress under Rule 32(d)(4) the court holds that the reasons given for the refusal to sign require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Certification and Filing by Officer; Exhibits; Copies; Notice of Completion. (1)</strong> The officer shall certify on the deposition that the witness was duly sworn by the officer and that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by the witness. The officer shall securely seal the deposition in an envelope endorsed with the title of the action and marked &ldquo;Deposition of [here <!-- PDFPage:391 -->insert name of witness]&rdquo; and shall have it delivered or mailed by registered or certified mail to the party taking the deposition. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the deposition shall not be filed with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Documents and things produced for inspection during the examination of the witness shall, upon the request of a party, be marked for identification and annexed to the deposition and may be inspected and copied by any party, except that if the person producing the materials desires to retain them the person may (A) offer copies to be marked for identification and annexed to the deposition and to serve thereafter as originals if the person affords to all parties fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparison with the originals, or (B) offer the originals to be marked for identification, after giving to each party an opportunity to inspect and copy them, in which event the materials may then be used in the same manner as if annexed to and returned with the deposition, pending final disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the officer shall furnish a copy of the deposition to any party or to the deponent.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 31. Depositions upon Written Questions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Serving Questions; Notice.</strong> After commencement of the action, any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon written questions. The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by the use of subpoena as provided in Rule 45. The deposition of a person confined in prison may be taken only by leave of court on such terms as the court prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A party desiring to take a deposition upon written questions shall serve them upon every other party with a notice stating <strong>(1)</strong> the name and address of the person who is to answer them, if known, and if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs, and <strong>(2)</strong> the name or descriptive title and address of the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken. A deposition upon written questions may be taken of a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency in accordance with the provisions of Rule 30(b)(6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 30 days after the notice and written questions are served, a party may serve cross questions upon all other parties. Within 10 days after being served with cross questions, a party may serve redirect questions upon all other parties. Within 10 days after being served with redirect questions, a party may serve recross questions upon all other parties. The court may for cause shown enlarge or shorten the time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Officer To Take Responses and Prepare Record.</strong> A copy of the notice and copies of all questions served shall be delivered by the party taking the deposition to the officer designated in the notice, who shall proceed promptly, in the manner provided by Rule 30(c), (e) and (f), to take the testimony of the witness in response to the questions and to prepare, certify, and deliver or mail the deposition, attaching thereto the copy of the notice and the questions received by the officer.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 32. Use of Depositions in Court Proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Use of Depositions.</strong> At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions, in addition to Appendix G &nbsp;12b, governing the use of depositions as substantive evidence:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership, or association, or governmental agency which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds: <strong>(A)</strong> that the witness is dead; or <strong>(B)</strong> that the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing and the judge after timely request has refused to authorize a subpoena to the witness or to set a trial in closer proximity to the place of residence of the witness, or is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or <strong>(C)</strong> that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, ill<!-- PDFPage:392 -->ness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or <strong>(D)</strong> that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or <strong>(E)</strong> upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4)</strong> If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Substitution of parties pursuant to Rule 25 does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken; and, when an action has been brought in any court of the United States or of any State and another action involving the same subject matter is afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken therefor. A deposition previously taken may also be used as permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Objections to Admissibility.</strong> Subject to the provisions of Rules 28(b) and 32(d)(3), objection may be made at the trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Effect of Taking or Using Depositions.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Errors and Irregularities in Depositions. (1) <em>As to Notice.</em></strong> All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>As to Disqualification of Officer.</em></strong> Objection to taking a deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>As to Taking of Deposition. </em></strong><strong>(A)</strong> Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> Objections to the form of written questions submitted under Rule 31 are waived unless served in writing upon the party propounding them within the time allowed for serving the succeeding cross or other questions and within 5 days after service of the last questions authorized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4) <em>As to Completion and Return of Deposition.</em></strong> Errors and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, transmitted, delivered or mailed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under Rules 30 and 31 are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 33. Interrogatories to Parties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Availability; Procedures for Use.</strong> Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Interrogatories may, without leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon the United States after service of the complaint. The form of interrogatories is governed by Appendix G &nbsp;7.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections signed by the attorney making them. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections, if any, within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories, except that the defendant may serve answers or objections within 45 days after service of the complaint upon the defendant. The court may allow a shorter or longer time. The party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under Rule 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Scope; Use at Trial.</strong> Interrogatories may relate to any matters which can be inquired into under Rule 26(b), and the answers may be used to the extent permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has been completed or until a pretrial conference or other later time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Option To Produce Business Records.</strong> Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, including a compilation, abstract, or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party <!-- PDFPage:393 -->serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries. A specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Scope.</strong> Any party may serve on any other party a request: (1) to produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on such party's behalf, to inspect and copy, any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, phono-records, and other data compilations from which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, by the respondent through detection devices into reasonably usable form), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which constitute or contain matters within the scope of Rule 26(b) and which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served; or (2) to permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon, within the scope of Rule 26(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure.</strong> The request may, without leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon the United States after service of the complaint. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or by category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 30 days after the service of the request, except that the United States may serve a response within 45 days after service of the complaint. The court may allow a shorter or longer time. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified. The party submitting the request may move for an order under Rule 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Persons Not Parties.</strong> A person not a party to the action may be compelled to produce documents and things or to submit to an inspection as provided in Rule 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Calls. (1) <em>Issuance.</em></strong> Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2507(a), the court at any time <strong>(A)</strong> may call upon any department or agency of the United States for any information or papers it deems necessary to be filed with the clerk within a specified time, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> in any case appropriate for a computation by a department or agency of the United States, the court, upon the motion of a party or on its own motion, may issue a call for the computation. Within 30 days after the clerk has served notice of the filing of the computation, each party shall file with the clerk its acceptance or rejection of the computation. A rejection shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Refusal of Compliance.</em></strong> The head of any department or agency of the United States may refuse to comply with such a call when, in the head of the department's or agency's opinion, compliance will be injurious to the public interest. Such refusal may be made known by a communication signed by the head of the department or agency and filed with the clerk.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 35. Physical and Mental Examination of Persons</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Order for Examination.</strong> When the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party, or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party's custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Report of Examiner. (1)</strong> If requested by the party against whom an order is made under subdivision (a) of this rule or the person examined, the party causing the examination to be made shall deliver to the requesting party a copy of a detailed written report of the examiner setting out the examiner's findings, including results of all tests made, diagnoses, and conclusions, together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. After delivery the party causing the examination shall be entitled upon request to receive from the party against whom the order is made a like report of any examination, previously or thereafter made, of the same condition, unless, in the case of a report of examination of a person not a party, the party shows that the party is unable to obtain it. The court on motion may make an order against a party requiring delivery of a report on such terms as are just, and if an examiner fails or refuses to make a report the court may exclude the examiner's testimony if offered at trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> By requesting and obtaining a report of the examination so ordered or by taking the deposi<!-- PDFPage:394 -->tion of the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege the party may have in that action or any other involving the same controversy, regarding the testimony of every other person who has examined or may thereafter examine the party in respect of the same mental or physical condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> Subdivision (b) of this rule applies to examinations made by agreement of the parties, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. Subdivision (b) of this rule does not preclude discovery of a report of an examiner or the taking of a deposition of the examiner in accordance with the provisions of any other rule.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 36. Requests for Admission</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Request for Admission.</strong> A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b) set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to facts including the genuineness of any documents described in the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. The request may, without leave of court, be served upon the plaintiff after commencement of the action and upon the United States after service of the complaint. The form of requests for admission and answers is governed by Appendix G &nbsp;7.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or by the party's attorney, but, unless the court shortens the time, the defendant shall not be required to serve answers or objections before the expiration of 45 days after service of the complaint. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify the party's answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless the answering party states that the answering party has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by the answering party is insufficient to enable the answering party to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; the party may, subject to the provisions of Rule 37(d), deny the matter or set forth reasons why the party cannot admit or deny it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the court determines that an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer be served. If the court determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court may, in lieu of these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be made at a pretrial conference or at a designated time prior to trial. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Effect of Admission.</strong> Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Subject to the provisions of Rule 16 governing amendment of a pretrial order, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice the party in maintaining the party's action or defense on the merits. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission by the party for any other purpose nor may it be used against the party in any other proceeding.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Motion for Order Compelling Discovery.</strong> A party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby, may apply for an order compelling discovery as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1) <em>Appropriate Court.</em></strong> [Not Used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Motion.</em></strong> If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or submitted under Rule 30 or 31, or a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a), or a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33, or if a party, in response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, fails to respond that inspection will be permitted as requested or fails to permit inspection as requested, the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer, or a designation, or an order compelling inspection in accordance with the request. See Appendix G &nbsp;8. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the examination before the proponent applies for an order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the court denies the motion in whole or in part, it may make such protective order as it would have been empowered to make on a motion made pursuant to Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>Evasive or Incomplete Answer.</em></strong> For purposes of subdivision (a) of this rule, an evasive or incomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4) <em>Award of Expenses of Motion.</em></strong> If the motion is granted, the court shall, after opportunity for hearing, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion or the party or attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, unless the court finds that the <!-- PDFPage:395 -->opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the motion is denied, the court shall, after opportunity for hearing, require the moving party or the attorney advising the motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure To Comply with Order. (1) <em>Sanctions Against a Deponent.</em></strong> If a deponent fails to be sworn or to answer a question after being directed to do so by the court, the failure may be considered a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Sanctions Against a Party.</em></strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of this rule or Rule 35, or if a party fails to obey an order entered under Rule 26(f), the court may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just and among others the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(A)</strong> An order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting such party from introducing designated matters in evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings unless the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(D)</strong> In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, an order treating as a contempt of court the failure to obey any orders except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(E)</strong> Where a party has failed to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring the party to produce another for examination, such orders as are listed in paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of subdivision (b) of this rule, unless the party failing to comply shows that the party is unable to produce such person for examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising such party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Expenses on Failure To Admit.</strong> If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested under Rule 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, such party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay such party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that <strong>(1)</strong> the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 36(a), or <strong>(2)</strong> the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or <strong>(3)</strong> the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, or <strong>(4)</strong> there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</p>

In lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to act or the attorney advising such party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
