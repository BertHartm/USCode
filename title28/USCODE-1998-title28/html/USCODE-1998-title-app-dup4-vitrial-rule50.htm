<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Judgment as a Matter of Law.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Motions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury. Such a motion shall specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Renewing Motion for Judgment After Trial; Alternative Motion for New Trial</cap-smallcap>. If, <!-- PDFPage:198 -->for any reason, the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence, the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. The movant may renew its request for judgment as a matter of law by filing a motion no later than 10 days after entry of judgment&mdash;and may alternatively request a new trial or join a motion for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on a renewed motion, the court may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if a verdict was returned:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allow the judgment to stand,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) order a new trial, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) direct entry of judgment as a matter of law; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if no verdict was returned:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) order a new trial, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) direct entry of judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Granting Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law; Conditional Rulings; New Trial Motion.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, the court shall also rule on the motion for a new trial, if any, by determining whether it should be granted if the judgment is thereafter vacated or reversed, and shall specify the grounds for granting or denying the motion for the new trial. If the motion for a new trial is thus conditionally granted, the order thereon does not affect the finality of the judgment. In case the motion for a new trial has been conditionally granted and the judgment is reversed on appeal, the new trial shall proceed unless the appellate court has otherwise ordered. In case the motion for a new trial has been conditionally denied, the appellee on appeal may assert error in that denial; and if the judgment is reversed on appeal, subsequent proceedings shall be in accordance with the order of the appellate court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any motion for a new trial under Rule 59 by a party against whom judgment as a matter of law is rendered shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a</em>). The present federal rule is changed to the extent that the formality of an express reservation of rights against waiver is no longer necessary. See <em>Sampliner v. Motion Picture Patents Co</em>., 254 U.S. 233 (1920); <em>Union Indemnity Co. v. United States</em>, 74 F.(2d) 645 (C.C.A.6th, 1935). The requirement that specific grounds for the motion for a directed verdict must be stated settles a conflict in the federal cases. See Simkins, <em>Federal Practice</em> (1934) &sect;189.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b</em>). For comparable state practice upheld under the conformity act, see <em>Baltimore and Carolina Line v. Redman</em>, 295 U.S. 654 (1935); compare <em>Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co</em>., 228 U.S. 364 (1913).</p>
<p class="note-body">See <em>Northern Ry. Co. v. Page</em>, 274 U.S. 65 (1927), following the Massachusetts practice of alternative verdicts, explained in Thorndike, <em>Trial by Jury in United States Courts</em>, 26 Harv.L.Rev. 732 (1913). See also Thayer, <em>Judicial Administration</em>, 63 U. of Pa.L.Rev. 585, 600&ndash;601, and note 32 (1915); Scott, <em>Trial by Jury and the Reform of Civil Procedure</em>, 31 Harv.L.Rev. 669, 685 (1918); Comment, 34 Mich.L.Rev. 93, 98 (1935).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The practice, after the court has granted a motion for a directed verdict, of requiring the jury to express assent to a verdict they did not reach by their own deliberations serves no useful purpose and may give offense to the members of the jury. See 2B Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;1072, at 367 (Wright ed. 1961); Blume, <em>Origin and Development of the Directed Verdict</em>, 48 Mich.L.Rev. 555, 582&ndash;85, 589&ndash;90 (1950). The final sentence of the subdivision, added by amendment, provides that the court's order granting a motion for a directed verdict is effective in itself, and that no action need be taken by the foreman or other members of the jury. See Ariz.R.Civ.P. 50(c); cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 (a). No change is intended in the standard to be applied in deciding the motion. To assure this interpretation, and in the interest of simplicity, the traditional term, &ldquo;directed verdict,&rdquo; is retained.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict will not lie unless it was preceded by a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of the second sentence of this subdivision sets the time limit for making the motion for judgment n.o.v. at 10 days after the entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after the reception of the verdict. Thus the time provision is made consistent with that contained in Rule 59(b) (time for motion for new trial) and Rule 52(b) (time for motion to amend findings by the court).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> deals with the situation where a party joins a motion for a new trial with his motion for judgment n.o.v. or prays for a new trial in the alternative, and the motion for judgment n.o.v. is granted. The procedure to be followed in making rulings on the motion for the new trial, and the consequences of the rulings thereon, were partly set out in <em>Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan</em>, 311 U.S. 243, 253, 61 S.Ct. 189, 85 L.Ed. 147 (1940), and have been further elaborated in later cases. See <em>Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co</em>., 330 U.S. 212, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947); <em>Globe Liquor Co., Inc. v. San Roman</em>, 332 U.S. 571, 68 S.Ct. 246, 92 L.Ed. 177 (1948); <em>Fountain v. Filson</em>, 336 U.S. 681, 69 S.Ct. 754, 93 L.Ed. 971 (1949); <em>Johnson v. New York, N.H. & H.R.R. Co</em>., 344 U.S. 48, 73 S.Ct. 125, 97 L.Ed. 77 (1952). However, courts as well as counsel have often misunderstood the procedure, and it will be helpful to summarize the proper practice in the text of the rule. The amendments do not alter the effects of a jury verdict or the scope of appellate review.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the situation mentioned, <em>subdivision (c)(1)</em> requires that the court make a &ldquo;conditional&rdquo; ruling on the new-trial motion, i.e., a ruling which goes on the assumption that the motion for judgment n.o.v. was erroneously granted and will be reversed or vacated; and the court is required to state its grounds for the conditional ruling. Subdivision (c)(1) then spells out the consequences of a reversal of the judgment in the light of the conditional ruling on the new-trial motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the motion for new trial has been conditionally granted, and the judgment is reversed, &ldquo;the new trial shall proceed unless the appellate court has otherwise ordered.&rdquo; The party against whom the judgment n.o.v. was entered below may, as appellant, besides seeking to overthrow that judgment, also attack the conditional grant of the new trial. And the appellate court, if it reverses the judgment n.o.v., may in an appropriate case also reverse the conditional grant of the new trial and direct that judgment be entered on the verdict. See <em>Bailey v. Slentz</em>, 189 F.2d 406 (10th Cir. 1951); <em>Moist Cold Refrigerator Co. v. Lou Johnson Co</em>., 249 F.2d 246 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 968, 78 S.Ct. 1008, 2 L.Ed.2d 1074 (1958); <em>Peters v. Smith</em>, 221 F.2d 721 (3d Cir.1955); <em>Dailey v. Timmer</em>, 292 F.2d 824 (3d Cir. 1961), explaining <!-- PDFPage:199 --><em>Lind v. Schenley Industries, Inc</em>., 278 F.2d 79 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 835, 81 S.Ct. 58, 5 L.Ed.2d 60 (1960); <em>Cox v. Pennsylvania R.R</em>., 120 A.2d 214 (D.C.Mun.Ct.App. 1956); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;1302.1 at 346&ndash;47 (Wright ed. 1958); 6 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;59.16 at 3915 n. 8a (2d ed. 1954).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the motion for a new trial has been conditionally denied, and the judgment is reversed, &ldquo;subsequent proceedings shall be in accordance with the order of the appellate court.&rdquo; The party in whose favor judgment n.o.v. was entered below may, as appellee, besides seeking to uphold that judgment, also urge on the appellate court that the trial court committed error in conditionally denying the new trial. The appellee may assert this error in his brief, without taking a cross-appeal. <em>Cf. Patterson v. Pennsylvania R.R</em>., 238 F.2d 645, 650 (6th Cir. 1956); <em>Hughes v. St. Louis Nat. L. Baseball Club, Inc</em>., 359 Mo. 993, 997, 224 S.W.2d 989, 992 (1949). If the appellate court concludes that the judgment cannot stand, but accepts the appellee's contention that there was error in the conditional denial of the new trial, it may order a new trial in lieu of directing the entry of judgment upon the verdict.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(2)</em>, which also deals with the situation where the trial court has granted the motion for judgment n.o.v., states that the verdict-winner may apply to the trial court for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 after the judgment n.o.v. has been entered against him. In arguing to the trial court in opposition to the motion for judgment n.o.v., the verdict-winner may, and often will, contend that he is entitled, at the least, to a new trial, and the court has a range of discretion to grant a new trial or (where plaintiff won the verdict) to order a dismissal of the action without prejudice instead of granting judgment n.o.v. See <em>Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., supra</em>, 330 U.S. at 217, 218 67 S.Ct. at 755, 756, 91 L.Ed. 849. Subdivision (c)(2) is a reminder that the verdict-winner is entitled, even after entry of judgment n.o.v. against him, to move for a new trial in the usual course. If in these circumstances the motion is granted, the judgment is superseded.</p>
<p class="note-body">In some unusual circumstances, however, the grant of the new-trial motion may be only conditional, and the judgment will not be superseded. See the situation in <em>Tribble v. Bruin</em>, 279 F.2d 424 (4th Cir. 1960) (upon a verdict for plaintiff, defendant moves for and obtains judgment n.o.v.; plaintiff moves for a new trial on the ground of inadequate damages; trial court might properly have granted plaintiff's motion, conditional upon reversal of the judgment n.o.v.).</p>
<p class="note-body">Even if the verdict-winner makes no motion for a new trial, he is entitled upon his appeal from the judgment n.o.v. not only to urge that that judgment should be reversed and judgment entered upon the verdict, but that errors were committed during the trial which at the least entitle him to a new trial.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> deals with the situation where judgment has been entered on the jury verdict, the motion for judgment n.o.v. and any motion for a new trial having been denied by the trial court. The verdict-winner, as appellee, besides seeking to uphold the judgment, may urge upon the appellate court that in case the trial court is found to have erred in entering judgment on the verdict, there are grounds for granting him a new trial instead of directing the entry of judgment for his opponent. In appropriate cases the appellate court is not precluded from itself directing that a new trial be had. See <em>Weade v. Dichmann, Wright & Pugh, Inc</em>., 337 U.S. 801, 69 S.Ct. 1326, 93 L.Ed. 1704 (1949). Nor is it precluded in proper cases from remanding the case for a determination by the trial court as to whether a new trial should be granted. The latter course is advisable where the grounds urged are suitable for the exercise of trial court discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) does not attempt a regulation of all aspects of the procedure where the motion for judgment n.o.v. and any accompanying motion for a new trial are denied, since the problems have not been fully canvassed in the decisions and the procedure is in some respects still in a formative stage. It is, however, designed to give guidance on certain important features of the practice.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The revision of this subdivision aims to facilitate the exercise by the court of its responsibility to assure the fidelity of its judgment to the controlling law, a responsibility imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Cf. Galloway v. United States</em>, 319 U.S. 372 (1943).</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision abandons the familiar terminology of <em>direction of verdict</em> for several reasons. The term is misleading as a description of the relationship between judge and jury. It is also freighted with anachronisms some of which are the subject of the text of former subdivision (a) of this rule that is deleted in this revision. Thus, it should not be necessary to state in the text of this rule that a motion made pursuant to it is not a waiver of the right to jury trial, and only the antiquities of directed verdict practice suggest that it might have been. The term &ldquo;judgment as a matter of law&rdquo; is an almost equally familiar term and appears in the text of Rule 56; its use in Rule 50 calls attention to the relationship between the two rules. Finally, the change enables the rule to refer to preverdict and post-verdict motions with a terminology that does not conceal the common identity of two motions made at different times in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a motion is denominated a motion for directed verdict or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the party's error is merely formal. Such a motion should be treated as a motion for judgment as a matter of law in accordance with this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (a)(1) articulates the standard for the granting of a motion for judgment as a matter of law. It effects no change in the existing standard. That existing standard was not expressed in the former rule, but was articulated in long-standing case law. <em>See generally</em> Cooper, <em>Directions for Directed Verdicts: A Compass for Federal Courts</em>, 55 MINN. L. REV. 903 (1971). The expressed standard makes clear that action taken under the rule is a performance of the court's duty to assure enforcement of the controlling law and is not an intrusion on any responsibility for factual determinations conferred on the jury by the Seventh Amendment or any other provision of federal law. Because this standard is also used as a reference point for entry of summary judgment under 56(a), it serves to link the two related provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision authorizes the court to perform its duty to enter judgment as a matter of law at any time during the trial, as soon as it is apparent that either party is unable to carry a burden of proof that is essential to that party's case. Thus, the second sentence of paragraph (a)(1) authorizes the court to consider a motion for judgment as a matter of law as soon as a party has completed a presentation on a fact essential to that party's case. Such early action is appropriate when economy and expedition will be served. In no event, however, should the court enter judgment against a party who has not been apprised of the materiality of the dispositive fact and been afforded an opportunity to present any available evidence bearing on that fact. In order further to facilitate the exercise of the authority provided by this rule, Rule 16 is also revised to encourage the court to schedule an order of trial that proceeds first with a presentation on an issue that is likely to be dispositive, if such an issue is identified in the course of pretrial. Such scheduling can be appropriate where the court is uncertain whether favorable action should be taken under Rule 56. Thus, the revision affords the court the alternative of denying a motion for summary judgment while scheduling a separate trial of <!-- PDFPage:200 -->the issue under Rule 42(b) or scheduling the trial to begin with a presentation on that essential fact which the opposing party seems unlikely to be able to maintain.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (a)(2) retains the requirement that a motion for judgment be made prior to the close of the trial, subject to renewal after a jury verdict has been rendered. The purpose of this requirement is to assure the responding party an opportunity to cure any deficiency in that party's proof that may have been overlooked until called to the party's attention by a late motion for judgment. Cf. <em>Farley Transp. Co. v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co</em>., 786 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1986) (&ldquo;If the moving party is then permitted to make a later attack on the evidence through a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or an appeal, the opposing party may be prejudiced by having lost the opportunity to present additional evidence before the case was submitted to the jury&rdquo;); <em>Benson v. Allphin</em>, 786 F.2d 268 (7th Cir. 1986) (&ldquo;the motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence provides the nonmovant an opportunity to do what he can to remedy the deficiencies in his case .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.); <em>McLaughlin v. The Fellows Gear Shaper Co</em>., 4 F.R.Serv. 3d 607 (3d Cir. 1986) (per Adams, J., dissenting: &ldquo;This Rule serves important practical purposes in ensuring that neither party is precluded from presenting the most persuasive case possible and in preventing unfair surprise after a matter has been submitted to the jury&rdquo;). At one time, this requirement was held to be of constitutional stature, being compelled by the Seventh Amendment. Cf. <em>Slocum v. New York Insurance Co</em>., 228 U.S. 364 (1913). But cf. <em>Baltimore & Carolina Line v. Redman</em>, 295 U.S. 654 (1935).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) does impose a requirement that the moving party articulate the basis on which a judgment as a matter of law might be rendered. The articulation is necessary to achieve the purpose of the requirement that the motion be made before the case is submitted to the jury, so that the responding party may seek to correct any overlooked deficiencies in the proof. The revision thus alters the result in cases in which courts have used various techniques to avoid the requirement that a motion for a directed verdict be made as a predicate to a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. E.g., <em>Benson v. Allphin</em>, 788 F.2d 268 (7th cir. 1986) (&ldquo;this circuit has allowed something less than a formal motion for directed verdict to preserve a party's right to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict&rdquo;). <em>See generally</em> 9 WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE &sect;2537 (1971 and Supp.). The information required with the motion may be supplied by explicit reference to materials and argument previously supplied to the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision deals only with the entry of judgment and not with the resolution of particular factual issues as a matter of law. The court may, as before, properly refuse to instruct a jury to decide an issue if a reasonable jury could on the evidence presented decide that issue in only one way.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This provision retains the concept of the former rule that the post-verdict motion is a renewal of an earlier motion made at the close of the evidence. One purpose of this concept was to avoid any question arising under the Seventh Amendment. <em>Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan</em>, 311 U.S. 243 (1940). It remains useful as a means of defining the appropriate issue posed by the post-verdict motion. A post-trial motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the pre-verdict motion. <em>E.g., Kutner Buick, Inc. v. American Motors Corp</em>., 848 F.2d 614 (3d cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="note-body">Often it appears to the court or to the moving party that a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of the evidence should be reserved for a post-verdict decision. This is so because a jury verdict for the moving party moots the issue and because a pre-verdict ruling gambles that a reversal may result in a new trial that might have been avoided. For these reasons, the court may often wisely decline to rule on a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of the evidence, and it is not inappropriate for the moving party to suggest such a postponement of the ruling until after the verdict has been rendered.</p>
<p class="note-body">In ruling on such a motion, the court should disregard any jury determination for which there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis enabling a reasonable jury to make it. The court may then decide such issues as a matter of law and enter judgment if all other material issues have been decided by the jury on the basis of legally sufficient evidence, or by the court as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised rule is intended for use in this manner with Rule 49. Thus, the court may combine facts established as a matter of law either before trial under Rule 56 or at trial on the basis of the evidence presented with other facts determined by the jury under instructions provided under Rule 49 to support a proper judgment under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">This provision also retains the former requirement that a post-trial motion under the rule must be made within 10 days after entry of a contrary judgment. The renewed motion must be served and filed as provided by Rule 5. A purpose of this requirement is to meet the requirements of F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Revision of this subdivision conforms the language to the change in diction set forth in subdivision (a) of this revised rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Revision of this subdivision conforms the language to that of the previous subdivisions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This technical amendment corrects an ambiguity in the text of the 1991 revision of the rule, which, as indicated in the Notes, was not intended to change the existing standards under which &ldquo;directed verdicts&rdquo; could be granted. This amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of law in jury trials may be entered against both plaintiffs and defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The only change, other than stylistic, intended by this revision is to prescribe a uniform explicit time for filing of post-judgment motions under this rule&mdash;no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment. Previously, there was an inconsistency in the wording of Rules 50, 52, and 59 with respect to whether certain post-judgment motions had to be filed, or merely served, during that period. This inconsistency caused special problems when motions for a new trial were joined with other post-judgment motions. These motions affect the finality of the judgment, a matter often of importance to third persons as well as the parties and the court. The Committee believes that each of these rules should be revised to require filing before end of the 10-day period. Filing is an event that can be determined with certainty from court records. The phrase &ldquo;no later than&rdquo; is used&mdash;rather than &ldquo;within&rdquo;&mdash;to include post-judgment motions that sometimes are filed before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. It should be noted that under Rule 6(a) Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in measuring the 10-day period, and that under Rule 5 the motions when filed are to contain a certificate of service on other parties.</p>
