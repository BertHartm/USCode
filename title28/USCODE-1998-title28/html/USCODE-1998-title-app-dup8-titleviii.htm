<h3 class="section-head">Rule 65. Injunctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Preliminary Injunction. (1) <em>Notice.</em></strong> No preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Consolidation of Hearing with Trial on Merits.</em></strong> Before or after the commencement of the hearing of an application for a preliminary injunction, the court may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application. Even when this consolidation is not ordered, any evidence received upon an application for a preliminary injunction which would be admissible upon the trial on the merits becomes part of the record on the trial and need not be repeated upon the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Temporary Restraining Order; Notice; Hearing; Duration.</strong> A temporary restraining order may be granted without written or oral notice to the adverse party or such party's attorney only if (1) it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant before the adverse party or such party's attorney can be heard in opposition, and (2) the applicant's attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if any, which have been made to give the notice and the reasons supporting the attorney's claim that notice should not be required. Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance; shall be filed forthwith in the clerk's office and entered of record; shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 10 days, as the court fixes unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered of record. In case a temporary restraining order is granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence of all matters except older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes on for hearing the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for a preliminary injunction and, if such party does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On 2 days&rsquo; notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification and in that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Security.</strong> No restraining order or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been <!-- PDFPage:405 -->wrongfully enjoined or restrained. No such security shall be required of the United States, or of an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of Rule 65.1 apply to a surety upon a bond or undertaking under this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Form and Scope of Injunction or Restraining Order.</strong> Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Employer and Employee.</strong> These rules do not modify any statute of the United States relating to temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions in actions affecting employer and employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Procedures. (1)</strong> An application for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction shall be filed with the clerk along with the complaint, unless the complaint has been filed previously. The application shall be accompanied by the proposed order(s), affidavits, supporting memoranda, and other documents upon which plaintiff intends to rely. The application shall also be accompanied by a statement of plaintiff's attorney that the attorney has hand delivered or caused to be hand delivered 2 copies of each of the foregoing documents to the office of the attorney in charge of the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Room 9030, Todd Building, 550 11th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20530.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> If plaintiff's attorney knows the name and address of the apparently successful bidder, plaintiff's attorney shall give the attorney notice by telephone or telegram of the intended filing of the application, shall provide the apparently successful bidder with a copy of its application, served on the same day by hand delivery, facsimile, or overnight carrier, and shall certify in the application whether or not the plaintiff's attorney has done so, or state that the apparently successful bidder is unknown. With respect to notice to interested parties, see Rule 14(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> The apparently successful bidder may enter an appearance at any hearing on the application for temporary restraining order if it advises the court of its intention to move to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) or has moved to intervene before the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4)</strong> The clerk promptly will inform the parties personally or by telephone of the judge to whom the case has been assigned and the time and place for the hearing, if any, on the application for the restraining order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(5)</strong> Except in an emergency, the court will not consider ex parte applications for a temporary restraining order.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 65.1. Security: Proceedings Against Sureties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Proceedings.</strong> Whenever these rules require or permit the giving of security by a party, and security is given in the form of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as the surety's agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. The surety's liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and such notice of the motion as the court prescribes may be served on the clerk of the court, who shall forthwith mail copies to the sureties if their addresses are known.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Sureties.</strong> Acceptable sureties on bonds shall be those bonding companies holding certificates of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury. See the latest U.S. Treasury Dept. Circ. 570. When a court decision provides for the giving of security, the clerk will furnish counsel with the appropriate bond form.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 68. Offer of Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the defending party's offer, with costs then accrued. If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof, and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment. An offer not accepted shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs. If the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer. The fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not preclude a subsequent offer. When the liability of one party to another has been determined by order or judgment, but the amount or extent of the liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party adjudged liable may make an offer of judgment, which shall have the same effect as an offer made before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not less than 10 days prior to the commencement of hearings to determine the amount or extent of liability.</p>
