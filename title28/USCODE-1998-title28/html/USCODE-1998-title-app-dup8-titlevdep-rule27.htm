<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Preliminary Complaint. (1) <em>Complaint.</em></strong> When a plaintiff cannot state a case with the requisite particularity without an examination of documents or things or other information in the possession of the United States, and the plaintiff has been unable upon application to obtain a sufficient examination of such documents or things or other information, such plaintiff may file a complaint stating the plaintiff's claim as far as is in the plaintiff's power. The complaint shall state specifically: (A) that it is filed under this rule; (B) the subject matter of a claim cognizable by this court, with as much particularity as plaintiff can provide; and (C) a description of the documents or things or other information required as definite as plaintiff can provide. Within 30 days after filing such preliminary complaint, plaintiff shall file a motion for leave to take depositions upon oral examination or written questions, to submit requests for admission or written interrogatories, or for production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property for inspection and other purposes, or such combination thereof as may be needed to obtain from the proper department or agency of the United States such documents or things or other information as may be deemed necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Order.</em></strong> If plaintiff's motion is allowed, the court by order shall designate the persons whose depositions may be taken, the subject matter of the examination, and whether the depositions shall be taken on oral examination or written interrogatories. The order shall specify the extent of other discovery permitted, and a date for completion of all discovery thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>Amended Complaint.</em></strong> Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint within 30 days after the discovery has been completed. Defendant need not respond to a preliminary complaint filed under this rule, but shall answer or otherwise respond to the amended complaint in accordance with these rules for answering an original complaint. If plaintiff's motion is not allowed, or if an amended complaint is not filed after the requested documents or things or other information is furnished or obtained, defendant shall file such responsive pleading or motion within such time as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pending Appeal.</strong> If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of the court or before <!-- PDFPage:389 -->the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, on motion the court may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in this court. The party who desires to perpetuate the testimony may file a motion for leave to take the depositions that shows <strong>(1)</strong> the names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the party expects to elicit from each and <strong>(2)</strong> the reasons for perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by Rules 34 and 35, and thereupon the depositions may be taken and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in these rules for depositions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Perpetuation by Action.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
