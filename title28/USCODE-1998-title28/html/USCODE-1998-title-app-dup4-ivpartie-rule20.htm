<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Permissive Joinder</cap-smallcap>. All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any <!-- PDFPage:123 -->right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will arise in the action. All persons (and any vessel, cargo or other property subject to admiralty process in rem) may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action. A plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief, and against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Separate Trials</cap-smallcap>. The court may make such orders as will prevent a party from being embarrassed, delayed, or put to expense by the inclusion of a party against whom the party asserts no claim and who asserts no claim against the party, and may order separate trials or make other orders to prevent delay or prejudice.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provisions for joinder here stated are in substance the provisions found in England, California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. They represent only a moderate expansion of the present federal equity practice to cover both law and equity actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">With this rule compare also [former] Equity Rules 26 (Joinder of Causes of Action), 37 (Parties Generally&mdash;Intervention), 40 (Nominal Parties), and 42 (Joint and Several Demands).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of this rule for the joinder of parties are subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a</em>). The first sentence is derived from <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r. 1. Compare Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;&sect;378, 379a; Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;&sect;147&ndash;148; N.J.Comp.Stat. (2 Cum.Supp., 1911&ndash;1924), N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;209, 211. The second sentence is derived from <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (he Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r. 4. The third sentence is derived from O. 16, r. 5, and the fourth from O. 16, r.r. 1 and 4.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b</em>). This is derived from <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r.r. 1 and 5.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">See the amendment of Rule 18(a) and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto. It has been thought that a lack of clarity in the antecedent of the word &ldquo;them,&rdquo; as it appeared in two places in Rule 20(a), contributed to the view, taken by some courts, that this rule limited the joinder of claims in certain situations of permissive party joinder. Although the amendment of Rule 18(a) should make clear that this view is untenable, it has been considered advisable to amend Rule 20(a) to eliminate any ambiguity. See 2 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> 202 (Wright Ed. 1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">A basic purpose of unification of admiralty and civil procedure is to reduce barriers to joinder; hence the reference to &ldquo;any vessel,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
