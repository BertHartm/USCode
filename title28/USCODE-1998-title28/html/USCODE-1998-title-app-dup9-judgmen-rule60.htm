<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Clerical Mistakes. Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record <!-- PDFPage:482 -->and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative or on motion of a party and after such notice, if any, as the court directs. After an appeal is filed, such mistakes may be corrected with leave of the appellate court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Mistakes, Inadvertence, Excusable Neglect&mdash;Newly Discovered Evidence&mdash;Fraud, Etc. On motion of a party or upon its own initiative and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial or rehearing under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">This rule does not limit the power of the court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not actually personally notified as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1655, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court. The procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.</p>
