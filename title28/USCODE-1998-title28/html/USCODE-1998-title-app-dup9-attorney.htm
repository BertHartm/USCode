<h3 class="section-head">Rule 75. Practice&mdash;Appearance&mdash;Substitution of Attorneys&mdash;Withdrawal of Attorney&mdash;Notification of Changes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Practice. Only an attorney admitted to the bar of the court may practice before the court, except that an individual may represent himself in an action. An attorney who is employed or retained by the United States, or an agency or officer thereof, may enter an appearance, file pleadings, and practice in this court in cases in which the United States or the agency is a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Appearances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except for an individual (not a corporation, partnership, organization or other legal entity) appearing <em>pro se</em>, each party and <em>amicus curiae</em> must appear through an attorney authorized to practice before the court. When a summons contains the name, address and telephone number of an attorney, the attorney shall be recognized as the attorney of record and no separate notice of appearance shall be required of the attorney. Provided, however, that an attorney representing the United States, or an agency or officer thereof, who is not otherwise admitted to practice before the court, shall serve a separate notice of appearance as prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In all other instances, an attorney authorized to appear in an action shall serve a separate notice of appearance for each action. The notice shall be substantially in the form as set forth in Form 11 of the Appendix of Forms. An appearance may be made by an individual attorney or a firm of attorneys. If the appearance is made by a firm of attorneys the individual attorney responsible for the litigation shall be designated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Substitution of Attorneys. A party who desires to substitute an attorney may do so by serving a notice of substitution upon the prior attorney of record and the other parties. The notice shall be substantially in the form as set forth in Form 12 of the Appendix of Forms. If the prior attorney of record wishes to be heard by the court on the substitution, that attorney may, by motion, request such relief as the attorney deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Withdrawal of Attorney. An attorney of record may withdraw an appearance only by order of the court, upon motion served upon the attorney's client and the other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notification of Changes. Whenever there is any change in the name of an attorney of record, the attorney's address or telephone number, a new notice of appearance for each action shall be promptly served upon the other parties and filed with the court. The notice shall be substantially in the form as set forth in Form 11 of the Appendix of Forms. Unless and until an attorney of record files a new notice of appearance as prescribed in this subdivision, service of all papers shall be made upon the attorney of record at the last known address.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The filing of a brief by an <em>amicus curiae</em> may be allowed upon a motion made as prescribed by Rule 7, or at the request of the court. The brief may be conditionally filed with the motion. The motion for leave shall identify the interest of the applicant and shall state the reasons why an <em>amicus curiae</em> is desirable. An <em>amicus curiae</em> shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position the <em>amicus curiae</em> brief will support unless the court for cause shown shall grant leave for later filing. In that event the court shall specify within what period an opposing party may answer. A motion of an <em>amicus curiae</em> to participate in the oral argument will be granted only for extraordinary reasons.</p>
