<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Right Preserved</cap-smallcap>. The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Demand</cap-smallcap>. Any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by (1) serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issue, and (2) filing the demand as required by Rule 5(d). Such demand may be indorsed upon a pleading of the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Same: Specification of Issues</cap-smallcap>. In the demand a party may specify the issues which the party wishes so tried; otherwise the party shall be deemed to have demanded trial by jury for all the issues so triable. If the party has demanded trial by jury for only some of the issues, any other party within 10 days after service of the demand or such lesser time as the court may order, may serve a demand for trial by jury of any other or all of the issues of fact in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>. The failure of a party to serve and file a demand as required by this rule constitutes a waiver by the party of trial by jury. A demand for trial by jury made as herein provided may not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Admiralty and Maritime Claims</cap-smallcap>. These rules shall not be construed to create a right to trial by jury of the issues in an admiralty or maritime claim within the meaning of Rule 9(h).</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule provides for the preservation of the constitutional right of trial by jury as directed in the enabling act (act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;723c [see 2072]), and it and the next rule make definite provision for claim and waiver of jury trial, following the method used in many American states and in England and the British Dominions. Thus the claim must be made at once on initial pleading or appearance under Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;188; 6 Tenn.Code Ann. (Williams, 1934) &sect;8734; compare Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann.

<p class="note-body">Rule 81(c) provides for claim for jury trial in removed actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The right to trial by jury as declared in U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;770 [now 1873] (Trial of issues of fact; by jury; exceptions), and similar statutes, is unaffected by this rule. This rule modifies U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;773 (Trial of issues of fact; by court).</p>
