<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. The petitioner or appellant shall file 40 copies of the brief on the merits within 45 days of the order granting the writ of certiorari, noting probable jurisdiction, or postponing consideration of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. The respondent or appellee shall file 40 copies of the brief on the merits within 30 days after receiving the brief for the petitioner or appellant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. The petitioner or appellant shall file 40 copies of the reply brief, if any, within 30 days after receiving the brief for the respondent or appellee, but any reply brief must actually be received by the Clerk not later than one week before the date of oral argument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. The time periods stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Rule may be extended as provided in Rule 30. An application to extend the time to file a brief on the merits is not favored. If a case is advanced for hearing, the time to file briefs on the merits may be abridged as circumstances require pursuant to an order of the Court on its own motion or that of a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. A party wishing to present late authorities, newly enacted legislation, or other intervening matter that was not available in time to be included in a brief may file 40 copies of a supplemental brief, restricted to such new matter and otherwise presented in conformity with these Rules, up to the time the case is called for oral argument or by leave of the Court thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. After a case has been argued or submitted, the Clerk will not file any brief, except that of a party filed by leave of the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">7. The Clerk will not file any brief that is not accompanied by proof of service as required by Rule 29.</p>
