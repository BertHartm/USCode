<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Postassignment Conferences&mdash;Objectives. In any action, the judge to whom the action is assigned may, in the discretion of that judge, direct the attorneys for the parties and any unrepresented parties to appear for a conference or conferences for such purposes as</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) expediting the disposition of the action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establishing early and continuing control so that the action will not be protracted because of lack of management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) discouraging wasteful activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) improving the quality of the proceedings for the final disposition of the action through more thorough preparation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) facilitating the settlement of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Scheduling and Planning. Except as provided in Rule 56.2 or when the judge to whom the action is assigned finds that a scheduling order will not aid in the disposition of the action and enters an order to that effect, together with a statement of reasons and facts upon which the order is based, the judge shall, after consulting with the attorneys for the parties and any unrepresented parties, by a scheduling conference, telephone, mail, or other suitable means, enter a scheduling order that limits the time</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to join other parties and to amend the pleadings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to file and hear motions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to complete discovery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The scheduling order also may include</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the date or dates for conferences before submission of the action for final disposition, <!-- PDFPage:458 -->a final postassignment conference, and trial or submission of a dispositive motion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) any other matters appropriate in the circumstances of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The scheduling order, or the order that a scheduling order will not aid in the disposition of the action, shall issue as soon as practicable but in no event more than 90 days after the action is assigned. A schedule shall not be modified except by leave of the judge upon a showing of good cause.</p>

<p class="note-body">The attorneys for the parties and any unrepresented parties are expected to consult prior to a postassignment conference. The consultations should pertain to such matters as: access to the confidential portions of the administrative record, if any; the definition of the issues; whether discovery is necessary or permissible; and, the establishment of a proposed discovery schedule, if it is agreed that discovery will be conducted.</p>
