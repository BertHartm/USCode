<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>. Process to enforce a judgment for the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise. The procedure on execution, in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of a judgment, and in proceedings on and in aid of execution shall be in accordance with the practice and procedure of the state in which the district court is held, existing at the time the remedy is sought, except that any statute of the United States governs to the extent that it is applicable. In aid of the judgment or execution, the judgment creditor or a successor in interest when that interest appears of record, may obtain discovery from any person, including the judgment debtor, in the manner provided in these rules or in the manner provided by the practice of the state in which the district court is held.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Against Certain Public Officers</cap-smallcap>. When a judgment has been entered against a collector or other officer of revenue under the circumstances stated in Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;2006, or against an officer of Congress in an action mentioned in the Act of March 3, 1875, ch. 130, &sect;8 (18 Stat. 401), U.S.C., Title 2, &sect;118, and when the court has given the certificate of probable cause for the officer's act as provided in those statutes, execution shall not issue against the officer or the officer's property but the final judgment shall be satisfied as provided in such statutes.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment assures that, in aid of execution on a judgment, all discovery procedures provided in the rules are available and not just discovery via the taking of a deposition. Under the present language, one court has held that Rule 34 discovery is unavailable to the judgment creditor. <em>M. Lowenstein & Sons, Inc. v. American Underwear Mfg. Co</em>., 11 F.R.D. 172 (E.D.Pa. 1951). Notwithstanding the language, and relying heavily on legislative history referring to Rule 33, the Fifth Circuit has held that a judgment creditor may invoke Rule 33 interrogatories. <em>United States v. McWhirter</em>, 376 F.2d 102 (5th Cir. 1967). But the court's reasoning does not extend to discovery except as provided in Rules 26&ndash;33. One commentator suggests that the existing language might properly be stretched to all discovery, 7 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;69.05[1] (2d ed. 1966), but another believes that a rules amendment is needed. 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 1484 (Wright ed. 1958). Both commentators and the court in <em>McWhirter</em> are clear that, as a matter of policy, Rule 69 should authorize the use of all discovery devices provided in the rules.</p>
