The clerk shall refuse to file any paper which is not in substantial conformity with this rule or not in clear type.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Duplication.</strong> All requirements of duplication may be satisfied by the use of any photocopy method capable of producing a clear black image on white paper, but not including ordinary carbon copy, provided, that in each instance the duplication shall conform to the requirements of subdivision (c) of this rule as to paper, size, form, and pagination.</p>

Papers duplicated shall be double spaced, except that quoted and indented material and footnotes may be single spaced, and, if covering both sides of the sheet, shall be duplicated on paper of sufficient quality that the duplication process does not bleed through the sheet; shall be bound or attached on the left margin and unfolded, in book form; and shall have legible margins when bound or attached. Such pages need not be justified on the right margin. The first page of each separate document shall be numbered 1. Page numbers shall be in large, distinct type and shall appear in the bottom center margin of the page.</p>
