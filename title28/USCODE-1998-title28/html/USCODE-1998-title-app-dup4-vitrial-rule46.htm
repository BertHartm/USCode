<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Formal exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which the party desires the court to take or the party's objection to the action of the court and the grounds therefor; and, if a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection does not thereafter prejudice the party.</p>

(Courtright, 1929) &sect;105&ndash;830; 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7653; Ohio Code Ann. (Throckmorton, 1936) &sect;11560; 1 S.D.Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;2542; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann.
