<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is an expression of the rule of completeness. McCormick &sect;56. It is manifested as to depositions in Rule 32(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, of which the proposed rule is substantially a restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is based on two considerations. The first is the misleading impression created by taking matters out of context. The second is the inadequacy of repair work when delayed to a point later in the trial. See McCormick &sect;56; California Evidence Code &sect;356. The rule does not in any way circumscribe the right of the adversary to develop the matter on cross-examination or as part of his own case.</p>
<p class="note-body">For practical reasons, the rule is limited to writings and recorded statements and does not apply to conversations.</p>
