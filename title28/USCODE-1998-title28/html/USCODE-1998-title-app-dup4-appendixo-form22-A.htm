<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment of Rule 14(a), a defendant who files a third-party complaint not later than 10 days after serving his original answer need not obtain leave of court to bring in the third-party defendant by service under Rule 4. Form 22&ndash;A is intended for use in these cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The changes in the form of summons reflect an earlier amendment of Rule 14(a), effective in 1948, making it permissive, rather than mandatory, for the third-party defendant to answer the plaintiff's complaint. See <em>Cooper v. D/S A/S Progress</em>, 188 F.Supp. 578 (E.D.Pa. 1960); 1A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 696 (Wright ed. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment of Rule 5(a) requiring, with certain exceptions, that papers be served upon all the parties to the action, the third-party defendant, even if he makes no answer to the plaintiff's complaint, is obliged to serve upon the plaintiff a copy of his answer to the third-party complaint. Similarly, the defendant is obliged to serve upon the plaintiff a copy of the summons and complaint against the third-party defendant.</p>
