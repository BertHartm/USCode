<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Real Party in Interest</cap-smallcap>. Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, or a party authorized by statute may sue in that person's own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought; and when a statute of the United States so provides, an action for the use or benefit of another shall be brought in the name of the United States. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Capacity To Sue or Be Sued</cap-smallcap>. The capacity of an individual, other than one acting in a representative capacity, to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the individual's domicile. The capacity of a corporation to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law under which it was organized. In all other cases capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the state in which the district court is held, except (1) that a partnership or other unincorporated association, which has no such capacity by the law of such state, may sue or be sued in its common name for the purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and (2) that the capacity of a receiver appointed by a court of the United States to sue or be sued in a court of the United States is governed by Title 28, U.S.C., Sections 754 and 959(a).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:118 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Infants or Incompetent Persons</cap-smallcap>. Whenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on behalf of the infant or incompetent person. An infant or incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a</em>). The real party in interest provision, except for the last clause which is new, is taken verbatim from [former] Equity Rule 37 (Parties Generally&mdash;Intervention), except that the word &ldquo;expressly&rdquo; has been omitted. For similar provisions see N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;210; Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann. (1931) &sect;&sect;89&ndash;501, 89&ndash;502, 89&ndash;503; <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r. 8. See also Equity Rule 41 (Suit to Execute Trusts of Will&mdash;Heir as Party). For examples of statutes of the United States providing particularly for an action for the use or benefit of another in the name of the United States, see U.S.C., Title 40, &sect;270b (Suit by persons furnishing labor and material for work on public building contracts *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may sue on a payment bond, &ldquo;in the name of the United States for the use of the person suing&rdquo;); and U.S.C., Title 25, &sect;201 (Penalties under laws relating to Indians&mdash;how recovered). Compare U.S.C., Title 26, [former] &sect;1645(c) (Suits for penalties, fines, and forfeitures, under this title, where not otherwise provided for, to be in name of United States).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b</em>). For capacity see generally Clark and Moore, <em>A New Federal Civil Procedure&mdash;II. Pleadings and Parties</em>, 44 Yale L.J. 1291, 1312&ndash;1317 (1935) and specifically <em>Coppedge v. Clinton</em>, 72 F.(2d) 531 (C.C.A.10th, 1934) (natural person); <em>David Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club of America</em>, 225 U.S. 489 (1912) (corporation); <em>Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co</em>., 288 U.S. 476 (1933) (unincorporated ass'n.); <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co</em>., 259 U.S. 344 (1922) (federal substantive right enforced against unincorporated association by suit against the association in its common name without naming all its members as parties). This rule follows the existing law as to such associations, as declared in the case last cited above. Compare <em>Moffat Tunnel League v. United States</em>, 289 U.S. 113 (1933). See note to Rule 23, clause (1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c</em>). The provision for infants and incompetent persons is substantially [former] Equity Rule 70 (Suits by or Against Incompetents) with slight additions. Compare the more detailed English provisions, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r.r. 16&ndash;21.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The new matter [in subdivision (b)] makes clear the controlling character of Rule 66 regarding suits by or against a federal receiver in a federal court.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Since the statute states the capacity of a federal receiver to sue or be sued, a repetitive statement in the rule is confusing and undesirable.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The minor change in the text of the rule is designed to make it clear that the specific instances enumerated are not exceptions to, but illustrations of, the rule. These illustrations, of course, carry no negative implication to the effect that there are not other instances of recognition as the real party in interest of one whose standing as such may be in doubt. The enumeration is simply of cases in which there might be substantial doubt as to the issue but for the specific enumeration. There are other potentially arguable cases that are not excluded by the enumeration. For example, the enumeration states that the promisee in a contract for the benefit of a third party may sue as real party in interest; it does not say, because it is obvious, that the third-party beneficiary may sue (when the applicable law gives him that right.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule adds to the illustrative list of real parties in interest a bailee&mdash;meaning, of course, a bailee suing on behalf of the bailor with respect to the property bailed. (When the possessor of property other than the owner sues for an invasion of the possessory interest he is the real party in interest.) The word &ldquo;bailee&rdquo; is added primarily to preserve the admiralty practice whereby the owner of a vessel as bailee of the cargo, or the master of the vessel as bailee of both vessel and cargo, sues for damage to either property interest or both. But there is no reason to limit such a provision to maritime situations. The owner of a warehouse in which household furniture is stored is equally entitled to sue on behalf of the numerous owners of the furniture stored. Cf. <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert</em>, 330 U.S. 501 (1947).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision that no action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed, after the objection has been raised, for ratification, substitution, etc., is added simply in the interests of justice. In its origin the rule concerning the real party in interest was permissive in purpose: it was designed to allow an assignee to sue in his own name. That having been accomplished, the modern function of the rule in its negative aspect is simply to protect the defendant against a subsequent action by the party actually entitled to recover, and to insure generally that the judgment will have its proper effect as res judicata.</p>
<p class="note-body">This provision keeps pace with the law as it is actually developing. Modern decisions are inclined to be lenient when an honest mistake has been made in choosing the party in whose name the action is to be filed&mdash;in both maritime and nonmaritime cases. See <em>Levinson v. Deupree</em>, 345 U.S. 648 (1953); <em>Link Aviation, Inc. v. Downs</em>, 325 F.2d 613 (D.C.Cir. 1963). The provision should not be misunderstood or distorted. It is intended to prevent forfeiture when determination of the proper party to sue is difficult or when an understandable mistake has been made. It does not mean, for example, that, following an airplane crash in which all aboard were killed, an action may be filed in the name of John Doe (a fictitious person), as personal representative of Richard Roe (another fictitious person), in the hope that at a later time the attorney filing the action may substitute the real name of the real personal representative of a real victim, and have the benefit of suspension of the limitation period. It does not even mean, when an action is filed by the personal representative of John Smith, of Buffalo, in the good faith belief that he was aboard the flight, that upon discovery that Smith is alive and well, having missed the fatal flight, the representative of James Brown, of San Francisco, an actual victim, can be substituted to take advantage of the suspension of the limitation period. It is, in cases of this sort, intended to insure against forfeiture and injustice&mdash;in short, to codify in broad terms the salutary principle of <em>Levinson v. Deupree</em>, 345 U.S. 648 (1953), and <em>Link Aviation, Inc. v. Downs</em>, 325 F.2d 613 (D.C.Cir. 1963).</p>
