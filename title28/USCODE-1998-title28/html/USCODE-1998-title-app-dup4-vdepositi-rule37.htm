<h3 class="section-head">Rule 37. Failure to Make Disclosure or Cooperate in Discovery: Sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Motion For Order Compelling Disclosure or Discovery</cap-smallcap>. A party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby, may apply for an order compelling disclosure or discovery as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Appropriate Court</em>. An application for an order to a party shall be made to the court in which the action is pending. An application for an order to a person who is not a party shall be made to the court in the district where the discovery is being, or is to be, taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Motion.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If a party fails to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a), any other party may move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party not making the disclosure in an effort to secure the disclosure without court action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or submitted under Rules 30 or 31, or a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a), or a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33, or if a party, in response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, fails to respond that inspection will be permitted as requested or fails to permit inspection as requested, the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer, or a designation, or an order compelling inspection in accordance with the request. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make the discovery in an effort to secure the information or material without court action. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the examination before applying for an order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response</em>. For purposes of this subdivision an evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response is to be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Expenses and Sanctions.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If the motion is granted or if the disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the motion was filed, the court shall, after affording an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion or the party or attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds that the motion was filed without the movant's first making a good faith effort to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action, or that the opposing party's nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified, or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the motion is denied, the court may enter any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and shall, after affording an opportunity to be heard, require the moving party or the attorney filing the motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable ex<!-- PDFPage:177 -->penses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may enter any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and may, after affording an opportunity to be heard, apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Failure To Comply With Order.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Sanctions by Court in District Where Deposition Is Taken</em>. If a deponent fails to be sworn or to answer a question after being directed to do so by the court in the district in which the deposition is being taken, the failure may be considered a contempt of that court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Sanctions by Court in Which Action Is Pending</em>. If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of this rule or Rule 35, or if a party fails to obey an order entered under Rule 26(f), the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) An order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting that party from introducing designated matters in evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, an order treating as a contempt of court the failure to obey any orders except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Where a party has failed to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring that party to produce another for examination, such orders as are listed in paragraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this subdivision, unless the party failing to comply shows that that party is unable to produce such person for examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Failure to Disclose; False or Misleading Disclosure; Refusal to Admit.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e)(1) shall not, unless such failure is harmless, be permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed. In addition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions. In addition to requiring payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, these sanctions may include any of the actions authorized under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule and may include informing the jury of the failure to make the disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested under Rule 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, the requesting party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (A) the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 36(a), or (B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (C) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, or (D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Failure of Party to Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers to Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection</cap-smallcap>. If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails (1) to appear before the officer who is to take the deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or (2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted under Rule 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the request, the court in which the action is pending on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. Any motion specifying a failure under clause (2) or (3) of this subdivision shall include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party failing to answer or respond in an effort to obtain such answer or response without court action. In lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to act or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be excused on the ground that the dis<!-- PDFPage:178 -->covery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a protective order as provided by Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(e) <cap-smallcap>Subpoena of Person in Foreign Country</cap-smallcap>.] (Abrogated Apr. 29, 1980, eff. Aug. 1, 1980)</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(f) <cap-smallcap>Expenses Against United States</cap-smallcap>.] (Repealed Oct. 21, 1980, eff. Oct. 1, 1981)</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Failure to Participate in the Framing of a Discovery Plan</cap-smallcap>. If a party or a party's attorney fails to participate in good faith in the development and submission of a proposed discovery plan as required by Rule 26(f), the court may, after opportunity for hearing, require such party or attorney to pay to any other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of this rule authorizing orders establishing facts or excluding evidence or striking pleadings, or authorizing judgments of dismissal or default, for refusal to answer questions or permit inspection or otherwise make discovery, are in accord with <em>Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas</em>, 212 U.S. 322 (1909), which distinguishes between the justifiable use of such measures as a means of compelling the production of evidence, and their unjustifiable use, as in <em>Hovey v. Elliott</em>, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), for the mere purpose of punishing for contempt.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37 provides generally for sanctions against parties or persons unjustifiably resisting discovery. Experience has brought to light a number of defects in the language of the rule as well as instances in which it is not serving the purposes for which it was designed. See Rosenberg, <em>Sanctions to Effectuate Pretrial Discovery</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480 (1958). In addition, changes being made in other discovery rules requiring conforming amendments to Rule 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37 sometimes refers to a &ldquo;failure&rdquo; to afford discovery and at other times to a &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; to do so. Taking note of this dual terminology, courts have imported into &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; a requirement of &ldquo;wilfullness.&rdquo; See <em>Roth v. Paramount Pictures Corp</em>., 8 F.R.D. 31 (W.D.Pa. 1948); <em>Campbell v. Johnson</em>, 101 F.Supp. 705, 707 (S.D.N.Y. 1951). In <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197 (1958), the Supreme Court concluded that the rather random use of these two terms in Rule 37 showed no design to use them with consistently distinctive meanings, that &ldquo;refused&rdquo; in Rule 37(b)(2) meant simply a failure to comply, and that wilfullness was relevant only to the selection of sanctions, if any, to be imposed. Nevertheless, after the decision in <em>Societe</em>, the court in <em>Hinson v. Michigan Mutual Liability Co</em>., 275 F.2d 537 (5th Cir. 1960) once again ruled that &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; required wilfullness. Substitution of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; for &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; throughout Rule 37 should eliminate this confusion and bring the rule into harmony with the <em>Societe Internationale</em> decision. See Rosenberg, <em>supra</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 489&ndash;490 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a</em>). Rule 37(a) provides relief to a party seeking discovery against one who, with or without stated objections, fails to afford the discovery sought. It has always fully served this function in relation to depositions, but the amendments being made to Rules 33 and 34 give Rule 37(a) added scope and importance. Under existing Rule 33, a party objecting to interrogatories must make a motion for court hearing on his objections. The changes now made in Rules 33 and 37(a) make it clear that the interrogating party must move to compel answers, and the motion is provided for in Rule 37(a). Existing Rule 34, since it requires a court order prior to production of documents or things or permission to enter on land, has no relation to Rule 37(a). Amendments of Rules 34 and 37(a) create a procedure similar to that provided for Rule 33.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1</em>). This is a new provision making clear to which court a party may apply for an order compelling discovery. Existing Rule 37(a) refers only to the court in which the deposition is being taken; nevertheless, it has been held that the court where the action is pending has &ldquo;inherent power&rdquo; to compel a party deponent to answer. <em>Lincoln Laboratories, Inc. v. Savage Laboratories, Inc</em>., 27 F.R.D. 476 (D.Del. 1961). In relation to Rule 33 interrogatories and Rule 34 requests for inspection, the court where the action is pending is the appropriate enforcing tribunal. The new provision eliminates the need to resort to inherent power by spelling out the respective roles of the court where the action is pending and the court where the deposition is taken. In some instances, two courts are available to a party seeking to compel answers from a party deponent. The party seeking discovery may choose the court to which he will apply, but the court has power to remit the party to the other court as a more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2</em>). This subdivision contains the substance of existing provisions of Rule 37(a) authorizing motions to compel answers to questions put at depositions and to interrogatories. New provisions authorize motions for orders compelling designation under Rules 30(b)(6) and 31(a) and compelling inspection in accordance with a request made under Rule 34. If the court denies a motion, in whole or part, it may accompany the denial with issuance of a protective order. Compare the converse provision in Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(3</em>). This new provision makes clear that an evasive or incomplete answer is to be considered, for purposes of subdivision (a), a failure to answer. The courts have consistently held that they have the power to compel adequate answers. <em>E.g., Cone Mills Corp. v. Joseph Bancroft & Sons Co</em>., 33 F.R.D. 318 (D.Del. 1963). This power is recognized and incorporated into the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4</em>). This subdivision amends the provisions for award of expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, to the prevailing party or person when a motion is made for an order compelling discovery. At present, an award of expenses is made only if the losing party or person is found to have acted without substantial justification. The change requires that expenses be awarded unless the conduct of the losing party or person is found to have been substantially justified. The test of &ldquo;substantial justification&rdquo; remains, but the change in language is intended to encourage judges to be more alert to abuses occurring in the discovery process.</p>
<p class="note-body">On many occasions, to be sure, the dispute over discovery between the parties is genuine, though ultimately resolved one way or the other by the court. In such cases, the losing party is substantially justified in carrying the matter to court. But the rules should deter the abuse implicit in carrying or forcing a discovery dispute to court when no genuine dispute exists. And the potential or actual imposition of expenses is virtually the sole formal sanction in the rules to deter a party from pressing to a court hearing frivolous requests for or objections to discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">The present provision of Rule 37(a) that the court shall require payment if it finds that the defeated party acted without &ldquo;substantial justification&rdquo; may appear adequate, but in fact it has been little used. Only a handful of reported cases include an award of expenses, and the Columbia Survey found that in only one instance out of about 50 motions decided under Rule 37(a) did the court award expenses. It appears that the courts <!-- PDFPage:179 -->do not utilize the most important available sanction to deter abusive resort to the judiciary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed change provides in effect that expenses should ordinarily be awarded unless a court finds that the losing party acted justifiably in carrying his point to court. At the same time, a necessary flexibility is maintained, since the court retains the power to find that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust&mdash;as where the prevailing party also acted unjustifiably. The amendment does not significantly narrow the discretion of the court, but rather presses the court to address itself to abusive practices. The present provision that expenses may be imposed upon either the party or his attorney or both is unchanged. But it is not contemplated that expenses will be imposed upon the attorney merely because the party is indigent.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b</em>). This subdivision deals with sanctions for failure to comply with a court order. The present captions for subsections (1) and (2) entitled, &ldquo;Contempt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Consequences,&rdquo; respectively, are confusing. One of the consequences listed in (2) is the arrest of the party, representing the exercise of the contempt power. The contents of the subsections show that the first authorizes the sanction of contempt (and no other) by the court in which the deposition is taken, whereas the second subsection authorizes a variety of sanctions, including contempt, which may be imposed by the court in which the action is pending. The captions of the subsections are changed to deflect their contents.</p>
<p class="note-body">The scope of Rule 37(b)(2) is broadened by extending it to include any order &ldquo;to provide or permit discovery,&rdquo; including orders issued under Rules 37(a) and 35. Various rules authorize orders for discovery&mdash;<em>e.g</em>., Rule 35 (b)(1), Rule 26(c) as revised. Rule 37(d). See Rosenberg, <em>supra</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 484&ndash;486. Rule 37(b)(2) should provide comprehensively for enforcement of all these orders. <em>Cf. Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197, 207 (1958). On the other hand, the reference to Rule 34 is deleted to conform to the changed procedure in that rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">A new subsection (E) provides that sanctions which have been available against a party for failure to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) to submit to examination will now be available against him for his failure to comply with a Rule 35(a) order to produce a third person for examination, unless he shows that he is unable to produce the person. In this context, &ldquo;unable&rdquo; means in effect &ldquo;unable in good faith.&rdquo; See <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is amplified to provide for payment of reasonable expenses caused by the failure to obey the order. Although Rules 37(b)(2) and 37(d) have been silent as to award of expenses, courts have nevertheless ordered them on occasion. <em>E.g., United Sheeplined Clothing Co. v. Arctic Fur Cap Corp</em>., 165 F.Supp. 193 (S.D.N.Y.1958); <em>Austin Theatre, Inc. v. Warner Bros. Picture, Inc</em>., 22 F.R.D. 302 (S.D.N.Y. 1958). The provision places the burden on the disobedient party to avoid expenses by showing that his failure is justified or that special circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Allocating the burden in this way conforms to the changed provisions as to expenses in Rule 37(a), and is particularly appropriate when a court order is disobeyed.</p>
<p class="note-body">An added reference to directors of a party is similar to a change made in subdivision (d) and is explained in the note to that subdivision. The added reference to persons designated by a party under Rules 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of the party carries out the new procedure in those rules for taking a deposition of a corporation or other organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c</em>). Rule 37(c) provides a sanction for the enforcement of Rule 36 dealing with requests for admission. Rule 36 provides the mechanism whereby a party may obtain from another party in appropriate instances either (1) and admission, or (2) a sworn and specific denial, or (3) a sworn statement &ldquo;setting forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny.&rdquo; If the party obtains the second or third of these responses, in proper form, Rule 36 does not provide for a pretrial hearing on whether the response is warranted by the evidence thus far accumulated. Instead, Rule 37(c) is intended to provide posttrial relief in the form of a requirement that the party improperly refusing the admission pay the expenses of the other side in making the necessary proof at trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37(c), as now written, addresses itself in terms only to the sworn denial and is silent with respect to the statement of reasons for an inability to admit or deny. There is no apparent basis for this distinction, since the sanction provided in Rule 37(c) should deter all unjustified failures to admit. This omission in the rule has caused confused and diverse treatment in the courts. One court has held that if a party gives inadequate reasons, he should be treated before trial as having denied the request, so that Rule 37(c) may apply. <em>Bertha Bldg. Corp. v. National Theatres Corp</em>., 15 F.R.D. 339 (E.D.N.Y. 1954). Another has held that the party should be treated as having admitted the request. <em>Heng Hsin Co. v. Stern, Morgenthau & Co</em>., 20 Fed.Rules Serv. 36a.52, Case 1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 1954). Still another has ordered a new response, without indicating what the outcome should be if the new response were inadequate. <em>United States Plywood Corp. v. Hudson Lumber Co</em>., 127 F.Supp. 489, 497&ndash;498 (S.D.N.Y. 1954). See generally Finman, <em>The Request for Admissions in Federal Civil Procedure</em>, 71 Yale L.J. 371, 426&ndash;430 (1962). The amendment eliminates this defect in Rule 37(c) by bringing within its scope all failures to admit.</p>
<p class="note-body">Additional provisions in Rule 37(c) protect a party from having to pay expenses if the request for admission was held objectionable under Rule 36(a) or if the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that he might prevail on the matter. The latter provision emphasizes that the true test under Rule 37(c) is not whether a party prevailed at trial but whether he acted reasonably in believing that he might prevail.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d</em>). The scope of subdivision (d) is broadened to include responses to requests for inspection under Rule 34, thereby conforming to the new procedures of Rule 34.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two related changes are made in subdivision (d): the permissible sanctions are broadened to include such orders &ldquo;as are just&rdquo;; and the requirement that the failure to appear or respond be &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is eliminated. Although Rule 37(d) in terms provides for only three sanctions, all rather severe, the courts have interpreted it as permitting softer sanctions than those which it sets forth. <em>E.g., Gill v. Stolow</em>, 240 F.2d 669 (2d Cir. 1957); <em>Saltzman v. Birrell</em>, 156 F.Supp. 538 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 554&ndash;557 (Wright ed. 1961). The rule is changed to provide the greater flexibility as to sanctions which the cases show is needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The resulting flexibility as to sanctions eliminates any need to retain the requirement that the failure to appear or respond be &ldquo;wilful.&rdquo; The concept of &ldquo;wilful failure&rdquo; is at best subtle and difficult, and the cases do not supply a bright line. Many courts have imposed sanctions without referring to wilfullness. <em>E.g., Milewski v. Schneider Transportation Co</em>., 238 F.2d 397 (6th Cir. 1956); <em>Dictograph Products, Inc. v. Kentworth Corp</em>., 7 F.R.D. 543 (W.D.Ky. 1947). In addition, in view of the possibility of light sanctions, even a negligent failure should come within Rule 37(d). If default is caused by counsel's ignorance of Federal practice, cf. <em>Dunn. v. Pa. R.R</em>., 96 F. Supp. 597 (N.D.Ohio 1951), or by his preoccupation with another aspect of the case, <em>cf. Maurer-Neuer, Inc. v. United Packinghouse Workers</em>, 26 F.R.D. 139 (D.Kans. 1960), dismissal of the action and default judgment are not justified, but the imposition of expenses and fees may well be. &ldquo;Wilfullness&rdquo; continues to play a role, along with various other factors, in the choice of sanctions. Thus, the scheme conforms to Rule 37(b) as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197, 208 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision is added to make clear that a party may not properly remain completely silent even when he regards a notice to take his deposition or a set of inter<!-- PDFPage:180 -->rogatories or requests to inspect as improper and objectionable. If he desires not to appear or not to respond, he must apply for a protective order. The cases are divided on whether a protective order must be sought. Compare <em>Collins v. Wayland</em>, 139 F.2d 677 (9th Cir. 1944), <em>cert. den</em>. 322 U.S. 744; <em>Bourgeois v. El Paso Natural Gas Co</em>., 20 F.R.D. 358 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); <em>Loosley v. Stone</em>, 15 F.R.D. 373 (S.D.Ill. 1954), with <em>Scarlatos v. Kulukundis</em>, 21 F.R.D. 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); <em>Ross v. True Temper Corp</em>., 11 F.R.D 307 (N.D.Ohio 1951). Compare also Rosenberg, <em>supra</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 496 (1958) with 2A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 530&ndash;531 (Wright ed. 1961). The party from whom discovery is sought is afforded, through Rule 26(c), a fair and effective procedure whereby he can challenge the request made. At the same time, the total non-compliance with which Rule 37(d) is concerned may impose severe inconvenience or hardship on the discovering party and substantially delay the discovery process. <em>Cf</em>. 2B Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 306&ndash;307 (Wright ed. 1961) (response to a subpoena).</p>
<p class="note-body">The failure of an officer or managing agent of a party to make discovery as required by present Rule 37(d) is treated as the failure of the party. The rule as revised provides similar treatment for a director of a party. There is slight warrant for the present distinction between officers and managing agents on the one hand and directors on the other. Although the legal power over a director to compel his making discovery may not be as great as over officers or managing agents, <em>Campbell v. General Motors Corp</em>., 13 F.R.D. 331 (S.D.N.Y. 1952), the practical differences are negligible. That a director's interests are normally aligned with those of his corporation is shown by the provisions of old Rule 26(d)(2), transferred to 32(a)(2) (deposition of director of party may be used at trial by an adverse party for any purpose) and of Rule 43(b) (director of party may be treated at trial as a hostile witness on direct examination by any adverse party). Moreover, in those rare instances when a corporation is unable through good faith efforts to compel a director to make discovery, it is unlikely that the court will impose sanctions. <em>Cf. Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e</em>). The change in the caption conforms to the language of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783, as amended in 1964.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f</em>). Until recently, costs of a civil action could be awarded against the United States only when expressly provided by Act of Congress, and such provision was rarely made. See H.R.Rept.No. 1535, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2&ndash;3 (1966). To avoid any conflict with this doctrine, Rule 37(f) has provided that expenses and attorney's fees may not be imposed upon the United States under Rule 37. See 2A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 857 (Wright ed. 1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">A major change in the law was made in 1966, 80 Stat. 308, 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412 (1966), whereby a judgment for costs may ordinarily be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States. Costs are not to include the fees and expenses of attorneys. In light of this legislative development, Rule 37(f) is amended to permit the award of expenses and fees against the United States under Rule 37, but only to the extent permitted by statute. The amendment brings Rule 37(f) into line with present and future statutory provisions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1980 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)</em>. New Rule 26(f) provides that if a discovery conference is held, at its close the court shall enter an order respecting the subsequent conduct of discovery. The amendment provides that the sanctions available for violation of other court orders respecting discovery are available for violation of the discovery conference order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Subdivision (e) is stricken. Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;1783 no longer refers to sanctions. The subdivision otherwise duplicates Rule 45(e)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. New Rule 26(f) imposes a duty on parties to participate in good faith in the framing of a discovery plan by agreement upon the request of any party. This subdivision authorizes the court to award to parties who participate in good faith in an attempt to frame a discovery plan the expenses incurred in the attempt if any party or his attorney fails to participate in good faith and thereby causes additional expense.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Failure of United States to Participate in Good Faith in Discovery</em>. Rule 37 authorizes the court to direct that parties or attorneys who fail to participate in good faith in the discovery process pay the expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by other parties as a result of that failure. Since attorneys&rsquo; fees cannot ordinarily be awarded against the United States (28 U.S.C. &sect;2412), there is often no practical remedy for the misconduct of its officers and attorneys. However, in the case of a government attorney who fails to participate in good faith in discovery, nothing prevents a court in an appropriate case from giving written notification of that fact to the Attorney General of the United States and other appropriate heads of offices or agencies thereof.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision is revised to reflect the revision of Rule 26(a), requiring disclosure of matters without a discovery request.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to new subdivision (a)(2)(A), a party dissatisfied with the disclosure made by an opposing party may under this rule move for an order to compel disclosure. In providing for such a motion, the revised rule parallels the provisions of the former rule dealing with failures to answer particular interrogatories. Such a motion may be needed when the information to be disclosed might be helpful to the party seeking the disclosure but not to the party required to make the disclosure. If the party required to make the disclosure would need the material to support its own contentions, the more effective enforcement of the disclosure requirement will be to exclude the evidence not disclosed, as provided in subdivision (c)(1) of this revised rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Language is included in the new paragraph and added to the subparagraph (B) that requires litigants to seek to resolve discovery disputes by informal means before filing a motion with the court. This requirement is based on successful experience with similar local rules of court promulgated pursuant to Rule 83.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of paragraph (2) is moved into paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under revised paragraph (3), evasive or incomplete disclosures and responses to interrogatories and production requests are treated as failures to disclose or respond. Interrogatories and requests for production should not be read or interpreted in an artificially restrictive or hypertechnical manner to avoid disclosure of information fairly covered by the discovery request, and to do so is subject to appropriate sanctions under subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised paragraph (4) is divided into three subparagraphs for ease of reference, and in each the phrase &ldquo;after opportunity for hearing&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;after affording an opportunity to be heard&rdquo; to make clear that the court can consider such questions on written submissions as well as on oral hearings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (A) is revised to cover the situation where information that should have been produced without a motion to compel is produced after the motion is filed but before it is brought on for hearing. The rule also is revised to provide that a party should not be awarded its expenses for filing a motion that could have been avoided by conferring with opposing counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (C) is revised to include the provision that formerly was contained in subdivision (a)(2) and to <!-- PDFPage:181 -->include the same requirement of an opportunity to be heard that is specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The revision provides a self-executing sanction for failure to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a), without need for a motion under subdivision (a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) prevents a party from using as evidence any witnesses or information that, without substantial justification, has not been disclosed as required by Rules 26(a) and 26(e)(1). This automatic sanction provides a strong inducement for disclosure of material that the disclosing party would expect to use as evidence, whether at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion, such as one under Rule 56. As disclosure of evidence offered solely for impeachment purposes is not required under those rules, this preclusion sanction likewise does not apply to that evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Limiting the automatic sanction to violations &ldquo;without substantial justification,&rdquo; coupled with the exception for violations that are &ldquo;harmless,&rdquo; is needed to avoid unduly harsh penalties in a variety of situations: <em>e.g</em>., the inadvertent omission from a Rule 26(a)(1)(A) disclosure of the name of a potential witness known to all parties; the failure to list as a trial witness a person so listed by another party; or the lack of knowledge of a pro se litigant of the requirement to make disclosures. In the latter situation, however, exclusion would be proper if the requirement for disclosure had been called to the litigant's attention by either the court or another party.</p>
<p class="note-body">Preclusion of evidence is not an effective incentive to compel disclosure of information that, being supportive of the position of the opposing party, might advantageously be concealed by the disclosing party. However, the rule provides the court with a wide range of other sanctions&mdash;such as declaring specified facts to be established, preventing contradictory evidence, or, like spoliation of evidence, allowing the jury to be informed of the fact of nondisclosure&mdash;that, though not self-executing, can be imposed when found to be warranted after a hearing. The failure to identify a witness or document in a disclosure statement would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence under the same principles that allow a party's interrogatory answers to be offered against it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This subdivision is revised to require that, where a party fails to file any response to interrogatories or a Rule 34 request, the discovering party should informally seek to obtain such responses before filing a motion for sanctions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of this subdivision is revised to clarify that it is the pendency of a motion for protective order that may be urged as an excuse for a violation of subdivision (d). If a party's motion has been denied, the party cannot argue that its subsequent failure to comply would be justified. In this connection, it should be noted that the filing of a motion under Rule 26(c) is not self-executing&mdash;the relief authorized under that rule depends on obtaining the court's order to that effect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. This subdivision is modified to conform to the revision of Rule 26(f).</p>
