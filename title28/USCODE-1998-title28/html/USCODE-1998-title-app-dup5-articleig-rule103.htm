<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Effect of erroneous ruling.&mdash;Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Objection.&mdash;In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Offer of proof.&mdash;In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Record of offer and ruling.&mdash;The court may add any other or further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection made, and the ruling thereon. It may direct the making of an offer in question and answer form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Hearing of jury.&mdash;In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Plain error.&mdash;Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> states the law as generally accepted today. Rulings on evidence cannot be assigned as error unless (1) a substantial right is affected, and (2) the nature of the error was called to the attention of the judge, so as to alert him to the proper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take proper corrective measures. The objection and the offer of proof are the techniques for accomplishing these objectives. For similar provisions see Uniform Rules 4 and 5; California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;353 and 354; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;&sect;60&ndash;404 and 60&ndash;405. The rule does not purport to change the law with respect to harmless error. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2111, F.R.Civ.P. 61, F.R.Crim.P. 52, and decisions construing them. The status of constitutional error as harmless or not is treated in <em>Chapman v. California</em>, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), reh. denied <em>id</em>. 987, 87 S.Ct. 1283, 18 L.Ed.2d 241.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The first sentence is the third sentence of Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure virtually verbatim. Its purpose is to reproduce for an appellate court, insofar as possible, a true reflection of what occurred in the trial court. The second sentence is in part derived from the final sentence of Rule 43(c). It is designed to resolve doubts as to what testimony the witness would have in fact given, and, in nonjury cases, to provide the appellate court with material for a possible final disposition of the case in the event of reversal of a ruling which excluded evidence. See 5 Moore's Federal Practice &sect;43.11 (2d ed. 1968). Application is made discretionary in view of the practical impossibility of formulating a satisfactory rule in mandatory terms.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This subdivision proceeds on the supposition that a ruling which excludes evidence in a jury case is likely to be a pointless procedure if the excluded evidence nevertheless comes to the attention of the jury. <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, L.Ed.2d 70 (1968). Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: &ldquo;The court may require the offer to be made out of the hearing of the jury.&rdquo; <em>In re McConnell</em>, 370 U.S. 230, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 8 L.Ed.2d 434 (1962), left some doubt whether questions on which an offer is based must first be asked in the presence of the jury. The subdivision answers in the negative. The judge can foreclose a particular line of testimony and counsel can protect his record without a series of questions before the jury, designed at best to waste time and at worst &ldquo;to waft into the jury box&rdquo; the very matter sought to be excluded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This wording of the plain error principle is from Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. While judicial unwillingness to be constructed by mechanical breakdowns of the adversary system has been more pronounced in criminal cases, there is no scarcity of decisions to the same effect in civil cases. In general, see Campbell, Extent to Which Courts of Review Will Consider Questions Not Properly Raised and Preserved, 7 Wis.L.Rev. 91, 160 (1932); Vestal, Sua Sponte Consideration in Appellate Review, 27 Fordham L.Rev. 477 (1958&ndash;59); 64 Harv.L.Rev. 652 (1951). In the nature of things the application of the plain error rule will be more likely with respect to the admission of evidence than to exclusion, since failure to comply with normal requirements of offers of proof is likely to produce a record which simply does not disclose the error.</p>
