<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5. Appeal by Permission</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Petition for Permission to Appeal.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To request permission to appeal when an appeal is within the court of appeals&rsquo; discretion, a party must file a petition for permission to appeal. The petition must be filed with the circuit clerk with proof of service on all other parties to the district-court action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The petition must be filed within the time specified by the statute or rule authorizing the appeal or, if no such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If a party cannot petition for appeal unless the district court first enters an order granting permission to do so or stating that the necessary conditions are met, the district court may amend its order, either on its own or in response to a party's motion, to include the required permission or statement. In that event, the time to petition runs from entry of the amended order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Contents of the Petition; Answer or Cross-Petition; Oral Argument.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The petition must include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the facts necessary to understand the question presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the question itself;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the relief sought;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the reasons why the appeal should be allowed and is authorized by a statute or rule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) an attached copy of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the order, decree, or judgment complained of and any related opinion or memorandum, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any order stating the district court's permission to appeal or finding that the necessary conditions are met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A party may file an answer in opposition or a cross-petition within 7 days after the petition is served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The petition and answer will be submitted without oral argument unless the court of appeals orders otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Form of Papers; Number of Copies.</strong> All papers must conform to Rule 32(a)(1). An original and 3 copies must be filed unless the court requires a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Grant of Permission; Fees; Cost Bond; Filing the Record.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Within 10 days after the entry of the order granting permission to appeal, the appellant must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pay the district clerk all required fees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) file a cost bond if required under Rule 7.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A notice of appeal need not be filed. The date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal for calculating time under these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The district clerk must notify the circuit clerk once the petitioner has paid the fees. Upon receiving this notice, the circuit clerk must enter the appeal on the docket. The record must be forwarded and filed in accordance with Rules 11 and 12(c).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived in the main from Third Circuit Rule 11(2), which is similar to the rule governing appeals under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b) in a majority of the circuits. The second sentence of subdivision (a) resolves a conflict over the question of whether the district court can amend an order by supplying the statement required by &sect;1292(b) at any time after entry of the order, with the result that the time fixed by the statute commences to run on the date of entry of the order as amended. Compare <em>Milbert v. Bison Laboratories</em>, 260 F.2d 431 (3d Cir., 1958) with <em>Sperry Rand Corporation v. Bell Telephone Laboratories</em>, 272 F.2d (2d Cir., 1959), <em>Hadjipateras v. Pacifica, S.A</em>., 290 F.2d 697 (5th Cir., 1961), and <em>Houston Fearless Corporation v. Teter</em>, 313 F.2d 91 (10th Cir., 1962). The view taken by the Second, Fifth and Tenth Circuits seems theoretically and practically sound, and the rule adopts it. Although a majority of the circuits now require the filing of a notice of appeal following the grant of permission to appeal, filing of the notice serves no function other than to provide a time from which the time for transmitting the record and docketing the appeal begins to run.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals from interlocutory orders under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b) the provisions of proposed Rule 3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in the district court upon the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to proposed amended Rule 3(e), supra.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment makes it clear that a court may require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In 1992 Congress added subsection (e) to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292. Subsection (e) says that the Supreme Court has power to prescribe rules that &ldquo;provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for&rdquo; in section 1292. The amendment of Rule 5 was prompted by the possibility of new rules authorizing additional interlocutory appeals. Rather than add a separate rule governing each such appeal, the Committee believes it is preferable to amend Rule 5 so that is will govern all such appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104&ndash;317, abolished appeals by permission under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(5), making Rule 5.1 obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">This new Rule 5 is intended to govern all discretionary appeals from district-court orders, judgments, or decrees. At this time that includes interlocutory appeals under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b), (c)(1), and (d)(1) & (2). If additional interlocutory appeals are authorized under &sect;1292(e), the new Rule is intended to govern them if the appeals are discretionary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:14 --><p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (a).</strong> Paragraph (a)(1) says that when granting an appeal is within a court of appeals&rsquo; discretion, a party may file a petition for permission to appeal. The time for filing provision states only that the petition must be filed within the time provided in the statute or rule authorizing the appeal or, if no such time is specified, within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1292(b), (c), and (d) provide that the petition must be filed within 10 days after entry of the order containing the statement prescribed in the statute. Existing Rule 5(a) provides that if a district court amends an order to contain the prescribed statement, the petition must be filed within 10 days after entry of the amended order. The new rule similarly says that if a party cannot petition without the district court's permission or statement that necessary circumstances are present, the district court may amend its order to include such a statement and the time to petition runs from the entry of the amended order.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision that the Rule 4(a) time for filing a notice of appeal should apply if the statute or rule is silent about the filing time was drawn from existing Rule 5.1.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (b).</strong> The changes made in the provisions in paragraph (b)(1) are intended only to broaden them sufficiently to make them appropriate for all discretionary appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (b)(2) a uniform time&mdash;7 days&mdash;is established for filing an answer in opposition or cross-petition. Seven days is the time for responding under existing Rule 5 and is an appropriate length of time when dealing with an interlocutory appeal. Although existing Rule 5.1 provides 14 days for responding, the Committee does not believe that the longer response time is necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (c).</strong> Subdivision (c) is substantively unchanged.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (d).</strong> Paragraph (d)(2) is amended to state that &ldquo;the date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal&rdquo; for purposes of calculating time under the rules. That language simply clarifies existing practice.</p>
