<p class="note-body">Section consolidates part of section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and part of section 579 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 580 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 579 and 580 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., fixed specific salaries for the United States attorneys and assistants, while section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for a contractual arrangement for compensation of special attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">According to a Department of Justice interpretation, provisions for specific salaries were superseded by section 678 of title 5, which provides for adjustment of compensation by heads of departments. Hence, this section leaves the amount of compensation to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 578b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that United States attorneys shall be paid for their services, was omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 578c of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that United States attorneys shall not receive fees in addition to their salaries, was omitted as obsolete, in view of this section and current practice.</p>
