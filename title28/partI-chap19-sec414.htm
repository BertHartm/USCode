<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that &ldquo;statutes&rdquo; shall be delivered to successors of United States attorneys and clerks and provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that all lawbooks for judges and others shall be marked as property of the United States and shall be transmitted to their successors, with section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to transmittal of &ldquo;Government publications.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;All Government publications and lawbooks&rdquo; and &ldquo;furnished under this chapter&rdquo; were used to cover &ldquo;all statutes&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Federal Reporter and continuations thereto.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;justices and judges of the United States&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;United States judges&rdquo; in conformity with uniform use of the phrase to describe all members of the Federal judiciary. Similar provisions in sections 334 and 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were therefore omitted as covered by this revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 413 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;permanent or bound&rdquo; were inserted in the last sentence of the revised section to obviate the wasteful practice under existing law of marking temporary pamphlets.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
