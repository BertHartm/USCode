<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 16 with the third sentence of section 146, and the final proviso in the third paragraph of section 182, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 16 of title 28 provided for adjournment by the marshal, or clerk, on written order of the judge, in case of inability of the district judge to attend at the commencement of any regular, adjourned or special term, or any time during such term. Said sections 146 and 182 thereof, related to the district courts of Colorado and Oklahoma, only, and contained special provisions for adjournment. Subsection (b) omits the requirement of written order where the judge is unable to make such order.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section broadens these provisions, and vests discretionary power in the court, by order made anywhere within the district, to adjourn any term of court &ldquo;for insufficient business or other good cause.&rdquo; To establish uniformity, the special provisions relating to Colorado and Oklahoma were omitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of said sections 146 and 182 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 85 and 116 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of subsection (a) authorizing the district court, with the consent of the judicial council of the circuit, to pretermit any term of court for insufficient business or other good cause, is inserted to obviate the expense and inconvenience of convening and adjourning a term for which no need exists.</p>
