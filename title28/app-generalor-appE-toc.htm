<h3 class="analysis-subhead">PROCEDURE IN CARRIER CASES</h3>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 1. Carrier's Request for Admission of Facts</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Time for Filing Request.</strong> In every suit filed by a carrier for the recovery of freight and/or passenger transportation charges, the carrier shall, at the time the complaint is filed or within 30 days thereafter, file with the clerk a request for admission by the defendant of the genuineness of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request, and of the truth of the material matters of fact relied on by the carrier for recovery in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Form and Content of Request.</strong> The request shall conform to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Duplication.</strong> The request, with accompanying schedules and documents, may be typewritten, printed, or otherwise mechanically reproduced from a typewritten original, provided that all copies filed with the clerk are legible and the words and figures shown therein are large enough type to be read without difficulty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Copies; Filing; Service.</strong> If the request accompanies the complaint, copies and service of such request shall be as provided in RCFC 4(b) and 5.3(d). If the request is filed subsequent to the filing of the complaint, copies and service of such request shall be as provided in RCFC 5 and 83, except that 5 copies shall be served on the defendant in lieu of one copy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Signature of Attorney.</strong> The request shall be signed by the attorney of record for plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Numbered Paragraphs; Material Facts.</strong> The statements contained in the request shall be properly separated and numbered and shall consist of specific statements of material facts which plaintiff expects to prove as opposed to general allegations of the kind used in pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Attachments.</strong> There shall be attached to the request copies of any contracts, letters, or other documents, excluding tariffs and other documents referred to in the schedules required by subdivisions 7 and 8, below, that plaintiff proposes to offer into evidence, in order that the genuineness of such documents may be admitted by defendant without having to call a witness to identify the same.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Nature of Dispute; Statement of Issues.</strong> The statement in the request shall be sufficiently explicit to show the nature of the dispute and the specific reason or reasons why plaintiff believes it is entitled to recover higher rates or charges than those allowed by the government. The word &ldquo;dispute&rdquo; as used in the preceding sentence, means the shipment or shipments with respect to which the General Services Administration (GSA) or another agency of the government determined that the carrier's charges had been overpaid or refused to pay the carrier's supplemental bills covering such shipments, rather than subsequent shipments which are not in dispute except for the fact that the overpayments determined as to the shipments in dispute have been deducted from the amount of the carrier's bills covering such subsequent shipments. In order to show the nature of the dispute, there shall <!-- PDFPage:473 -->be attached to or included in plaintiff's request a statement of the issues which, with respect to each group of the carrier's bills involving the same issue, shall consist of a brief narrative statement of such issue with a reference to (A) court decisions involving the same issue, or (B) the tariffs, contract terms, or other authority relied upon by plaintiff, and the tariffs or other authority that plaintiff believes defendant relied upon in making deductions for claimed overpayments to the carrier or in refusing to pay the carrier's supplemental bills for claimed undercharges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7) Schedule; Claim for Transportation of Property.</strong> Where the claim is for the recovery of charges for the transportation of property for the government, there shall be attached to the request a detailed schedule, prepared by or under the supervision of the general auditor, comptroller, or other principal accounting officer of the carrier.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Agreement; Modification; Denial.</strong> Defendant shall file such response within the time fixed by the court's order, agreeing to the separate items of fact, modifying the same in accordance with the facts known by defendant, specifically denying the same or setting forth in detail the reasons why it cannot truthfully admit or deny designated portions of the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Defendant's Statement of Issues.</strong> If defendant does not agree with plaintiff's statement of the issues, it shall attach to or include in its response a statement of the issues, which, with respect to each group of the carrier's bills involving the same issue, shall consist of a brief narrative statement of the issue, as defendant contends, with reference to (1) a court decision involving the same issue, or (2) the tariffs or other authority relied upon by defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Verification of Carrier's Computations.</strong> If defendant finds that the schedule attached to plaintiff's request, or any portion thereof affecting the amount claimed, is incorrect on the basis of the tariffs, government rate quotations, or other authority relied on by plaintiff in its request, there shall be attached to the response a schedule prepared by defendant, setting forth the facts and figures as to the amount of freight charges defendant asserts would be due on each carrier's bill if the court holds that the tariffs or other authorities relied on by plaintiff in its request are applicable, and showing how defendant arrived at any changes or corrections in the amounts claimed by plaintiff.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Qualified Denial of Facts Available to Defendant; Consequences.</strong> Where the request sets forth any facts that are within the knowledge of GSA or of the department or agency of defendant for which the transportation was performed and these facts specifically include but are not limited to the facts and figures that plaintiff, by this order, is directed to include in its schedules, a response stating that defendant cannot truthfully admit or deny such facts, or a denial based on a lack of knowledge by defendant's attorney of record, shall be deemed an admission thereof, provided that such a response shall not be deemed an admission if accompanied by the sworn statement of the official in charge of the records that a search has been made for the necessary documents or information and that the documents or information cannot be found.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Relation to Pleadings; Time for Filing Answer or Counterclaim.</strong> In all cases to which this procedure applies, the time for filing defendant's answer and any counterclaim may, without regard to the provisions of RCFC 12 and 13, be contemporaneous with the date fixed by the judge for filing defendant's response to plaintiff's request, provided, however, that the period of limitations provided by 49 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;11705 and 14705 within which defendant may file a counterclaim is not extended by any rule set forth in this Appendix or by any order. At its option, defendant may include the response in its answer or counterclaim, which pleadings, nevertheless, shall otherwise comply with the rules applicable to them.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 3. Acceptance of Response; Pretrial; Judgment</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Plaintiff's Acceptance of Response.</strong> If a plaintiff is willing to accept the amount shown to be due it in defendant's response, or, where a counterclaim has been filed, is willing to accept the net amount shown to be due plaintiff in the response after deducting the amount of defendant's counterclaim, plaintiff's attorney of record shall sign and file with the clerk within 30 days after the filing of the response an original and two copies of a typewritten statement titled &ldquo;Plaintiff's Acceptance of the Amount Defendant Admits is Due,&rdquo; indicating that the response shows that a specified sum is due plaintiff or, where a counterclaim has been filed, that the response shows that the net amount of the counterclaim is a specified sum, and that plaintiff consents to the entry of judgment in the amount specified in favor of plaintiff in full settlement and satisfaction of all claims asserted in the complaint and request for admission of facts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pretrial Conference; Fixing Amount of Recovery.</strong> When plaintiff does not file an acceptance of the amount shown to be due in the response, a pretrial conference shall be held for the purpose of (1) resolving all issues and recording an agreement for the entry of judgment or for dismissal of the complaint or any part thereof, or (2) segregating the carrier's bills in dispute from those not in controversy and fixing the amount that either party would be entitled to recover in the event of a decision in its favor, and/or (3) taking any other action that may aid in the prompt disposition of the suit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Entry of Judgment.</strong> Where all material issues are disposed of through the filing by plaintiff of its acceptance of the amount shown to be due in defendant's response, or at the pretrial conference, or by defendant's failure to file its response within the time fixed by the judge, judgment may be entered without further proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 4. Cases Within Primary Jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Referral to the Surface Transportation Board.</strong> In any suit subject to the terms of this Appendix, if defendant contends, whether on the basis of the freight charge computations used by plaintiff or on the basis of the freight charge computations used by defendant, that any of the carrier's bills listed in the request raise issues within the primary jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board, and if defendant intends to move the court to refer such issues to that agency, defendant shall file its motion with the clerk at the time fixed for the filing of its response under this order. The motion shall contain:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> an identification of the carrier's bills involved unless all the bills in suit are included in the motion;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> a statement as to whether the Surface Transportation Board has construed the cited tariffs in prior decisions or has clarified the facts underlying them, citing the pertinent decisions, if any.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Referral.</strong> Plaintiff's response to the motion shall be filed within 30 days after service of the motion and shall state whether plaintiff concurs in the motion. If plaintiff contends that the Surface Transportation Board has construed the tariffs referred to in defendant's motion or has clarified the factors underlying them in previous decisions, the response shall cite such decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Referral to Surface Transportation Board&mdash;Plaintiff's Motion.</strong> In any suit subject to the terms of this Appendix, if plaintiff contends that any of the carrier's bills in suit raise issues within the primary jurisdiction of the Surface <!-- PDFPage:476 -->Transportation Board and if plaintiff intends to move the court to refer such issues to that agency, plaintiff shall file its motion within 30 days after the date defendant's response is filed and shall conform such motion to the requirements of Rule 4(a), above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Referral.</strong> Defendant's response to plaintiff's motion shall conform to the requirements of Rule 4(b), above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Effect of Filing a Referral Motion.</strong> The trial of any case subject to the terms of this Appendix in which a motion for referral is filed shall be deferred until final action on the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Failure to File a Referral Motion Within the Specified Time.</strong> The failure of either party to file, within the time prescribed above, a motion requesting the court to refer a pending case or any part thereof to the Surface Transportation Board may be deemed good cause for denying any such motion thereafter filed.</p>
