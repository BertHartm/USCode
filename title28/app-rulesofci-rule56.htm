<h3 class="section-head">Rule 56. Summary Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>By a Claiming Party.</cap-smallcap> A party claiming relief may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim. The motion may be filed at any time after:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 20 days have passed from commencement of the action; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the opposing party serves a motion for summary judgment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>By a Defending Party.</cap-smallcap> A party against whom relief is sought may move at any time, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Serving the Motion; Proceedings.</cap-smallcap> The motion must be served at least 10 days before the day set for the hearing. An opposing party may serve opposing affidavits before the hearing day. The judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Case Not Fully Adjudicated on the Motion.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Establishing Facts.</em> If summary judgment is not rendered on the whole action, the court <!-- PDFPage:251 -->should, to the extent practicable, determine what material facts are not genuinely at issue. The court should so determine by examining the pleadings and evidence before it and by interrogating the attorneys. It should then issue an order specifying what facts&mdash;including items of damages or other relief&mdash;are not genuinely at issue. The facts so specified must be treated as established in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Establishing Liability.</em> An interlocutory summary judgment may be rendered on liability alone, even if there is a genuine issue on the amount of damages.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Affidavits; Further Testimony.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> A supporting or opposing affidavit must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters stated. If a paper or part of a paper is referred to in an affidavit, a sworn or certified copy must be attached to or served with the affidavit. The court may permit an affidavit to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or additional affidavits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Opposing Party's Obligation to Respond.</em> When a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must&mdash;by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule&mdash;set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so respond, summary judgment should, if appropriate, be entered against that party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>When Affidavits Are Unavailable.</cap-smallcap> If a party opposing the motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deny the motion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) order a continuance to enable affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be taken, or other discovery to be undertaken; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) issue any other just order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Affidavit Submitted in Bad Faith.</cap-smallcap> If satisfied that an affidavit under this rule is submitted in bad faith or solely for delay, the court must order the submitting party to pay the other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, it incurred as a result. An offending party or attorney may also be held in contempt.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is applicable to all actions, including those against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">Summary judgment procedure is a method for promptly disposing of actions in which there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. It has been extensively used in England for more than 50 years and has been adopted in a number of American states. New York, for example, has made great use of it. During the first nine years after its adoption there, the records of New York county alone show 5,600 applications for summary judgments. <em>Report of the Commission on the Administration of Justice in New York State</em> (1934), p. 383. See also <em>Third Annual Report of the Judicial Council of the State of New York</em> (1937), p. 30.</p>
<p class="note-body">In England it was first employed only in cases of liquidated claims, but there has been a steady enlargement of the scope of the remedy until it is now used in actions to recover land or chattels and in all other actions at law, for liquidated or unliquidated claims, except for a few designated torts and breach of promise of marriage. <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 3, r. 6; Orders 14, 14A, and 15; see also O. 32, r. 6, authorizing an application for judgment at any time upon admissions. In Michigan (3 Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;14260) and Illinois (Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;&sect;181, 259.15, 259.16), it is not limited to liquidated demands. New York (N.Y.R.C.P. (1937) Rule 113; see also Rule 107) has brought so many classes of actions under the operation of the rule that the Commission on Administration of Justice in New York State (1934) recommend that all restrictions be removed and that the remedy be available &ldquo;in any action&rdquo; (p. 287). For the history and nature of the summary judgment procedure and citations of state statutes, see Clark and Samenow, <em>The Summary Judgment</em> (1929), 38 Yale L.J. 423.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. See Rule 16 (Pre-Trial Procedure; Formulating Issues) and the <em>Note</em> thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions (e) and (f)</em>. These are similar to rules in Michigan. Mich.Court Rules Ann. (Searl, 1933) Rule 30.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment allows a claimant to move for a summary judgment at any time after the expiration of 20 days from the commencement of the action or after service of a motion for summary judgment by the adverse party. This will normally operate to permit an earlier motion by the claimant than under the original rule, where the phrase &ldquo;at any time after the pleading in answer thereto has been served&rdquo; operates to prevent a claimant from moving for summary judgment, even in a case clearly proper for its exercise, until a formal answer has been filed. Thus in <em>Peoples Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</em> (N.D.Cal. 1944) 58 F.Supp. 25, the plaintiff's counter-motion for a summary judgment was stricken as premature, because the defendant had not filed an answer. Since Rule 12(a) allows at least 20 days for an answer, that time plus the 10 days required in Rule 56(c) means that under original Rule 56(a) a minimum period of 30 days necessarily has to elapse in every case before the claimant can be heard on his right to a summary judgment. An extension of time by the court or the service of preliminary motions of any kind will prolong that period even further. In many cases this merely represents unnecessary delay. See <em>United States v. Adler's Creamery, Inc</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1939) 107 F.(2d) 987. The changes are in the interest of more expeditious litigation. The 20-day period, as provided, gives the defendant an opportunity to secure counsel and determine a course of action. But in a case where the defendant himself serves a motion for summary judgment within that time, there is no reason to restrict the plaintiff and the amended rule so provides.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment of Rule 56(c), by the addition of the final sentence, resolves a doubt expressed in <em>Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp</em>. (1944) 321 U.S. 620. See also Commentary, <em>Summary Judgment as to Damages</em> (1944) 7 Fed.Rules Serv. 974; <em>Madeirense Do Brasil S/A v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1945) 147 F.(2d) 399, cert. den. (1945) 325 U.S. 861. It makes clear that although the question of recovery depends on the amount of damages, the summary judgment rule is applicable and summary judgment may be granted in a proper case. If the case is not fully adjudicated it may be dealt with as provided in subdivision (d) of Rule 56, and the right to summary recovery determined by a preliminary order, interlocutory in character, and the precise amount of recovery left for trial.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:252 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Rule 54(a) defines &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; as including a decree and &ldquo;any order from which an appeal lies.&rdquo; Subdivision (d) of Rule 56 indicates clearly, however, that a partial summary &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; is not a final judgment, and, therefore, that it is not appealable, unless in the particular case some statute allows an appeal from the interlocutory order involved. The partial summary judgment is merely a pretrial adjudication that certain issues shall be deemed established for the trial of the case. This adjudication is more nearly akin to the preliminary order under Rule 16, and likewise serves the purpose of speeding up litigation by eliminating before trial matters wherein there is no genuine issue of fact. See <em>Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1942) 130 F.(2d) 535; <em>Biggins v. Oltmer Iron Works</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1946) 154 F.(2d) 214; 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938). 3190&ndash;3192. Since interlocutory appeals are not allowed, except where specifically provided by statute (see 3 <em>Moore, op. cit. supra</em>, 3155&ndash;3156) this interpretation is in line with that policy, <em>Leonard v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra</em>. See also <em>Audi Vision Inc., v. RCA Mfg. Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 621; <em>Toomey v. Toomey</em> (App.D.C. 1945) 149 F.(2d) 19; <em>Biggins v. Oltmer Iron Works, supra; Catlin v. United States</em> (1945) 324 U.S. 229.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. By the amendment &ldquo;answers to interrogatories&rdquo; are included among the materials which may be considered on motion for summary judgment. The phrase was inadvertently omitted from the rule, see 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 159&ndash;60 (Wright ed. 1958), and the courts have generally reached by interpretation the result which will hereafter be required by the text of the amended rule. See Annot., 74 A.L.R.2d 984 (1960).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The words &ldquo;answers to interrogatories&rdquo; are added in the third sentence of this subdivision to conform to the amendment of subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last two sentences are added to overcome a line of cases, chiefly in the Third Circuit, which has impaired the utility of the summary judgment device. A typical case is as follows: A party supports his motion for summary judgment by affidavits or other evidentiary matters sufficient to show that there is no genuine issue as to a material fact. The adverse party, in opposing the motion, does not produce any evidentiary matter, or produces some but not enough to establish that there is a genuine issue for trial. Instead, the adverse party rests on averments of his pleadings which on their face present an issue. In this situation Third Circuit cases have taken the view that summary judgment must be denied, at least if the averments are &ldquo;well-pleaded,&rdquo; and not suppositious, conclusory, or ultimate. See <em>Frederick Hart & Co., Inc. v. Recordgraph Corp</em>., 169 F.2d 580 (3d Cir. 1948); <em>United States ex rel. Kolton v. Halpern</em>, 260 F.2d 590 (3d Cir. 1958); <em>United States ex rel. Nobles v. Ivey Bros. Constr. Co., Inc</em>., 191 F.Supp. 383 (D.Del. 1961); <em>Jamison v. Pennsylvania Salt Mfg. Co</em>., 22 F.R.D. 238 (W.D.Pa. 1958); <em>Bunny Bear, Inc. v. Dennis Mitchell Industries</em>, 139 F.Supp. 542 (E.D.Pa. 1956); <em>Levy v. Equitable Life Assur. Society</em>, 18 F.R.D. 164 (E.D.Pa. 1955).</p>
<p class="note-body">The very mission of the summary judgment procedure is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial. The Third Circuit doctrine, which permits the pleadings themselves to stand in the way of granting an otherwise justified summary judgment, is incompatible with the basic purpose of the rule. See 6 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> 2069 (2d ed. 1953); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, &sect;1235.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is hoped that the amendment will contribute to the more effective utilization of the salutary device of summary judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is not intended to derogate from the solemnity of the pleadings. Rather it recognizes that, despite the best efforts of counsel to make his pleadings accurate, they may be overwhelmingly contradicted by the proof available to his adversary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nor is the amendment designed to affect the ordinary standards applicable to the summary judgment motion. So, for example: Where an issue as to a material fact cannot be resolved without observation of the demeanor of witnesses in order to evaluate their credibility, summary judgment is not appropriate. Where the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented. And summary judgment may be inappropriate where the party opposing it shows under subdivision (f) that he cannot at the time present facts essential to justify his opposition.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 56 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 56(a) and (b) referred to summary-judgment motions on or against a claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim, or to obtain a declaratory judgment. The list was incomplete. Rule 56 applies to third-party claimants, intervenors, claimants in interpleader, and others. Amended Rule 56(a) and (b) carry forward the present meaning by referring to a party claiming relief and a party against whom relief is sought.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 56(c), (d), and (e) stated circumstances in which summary judgment &ldquo;shall be rendered,&rdquo; the court &ldquo;shall if practicable&rdquo; ascertain facts existing without substantial controversy, and &ldquo;if appropriate, shall&rdquo; enter summary judgment. In each place &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;should.&rdquo; It is established that although there is no discretion to enter summary judgment when there is a genuine issue as to any material fact, there is discretion to deny summary judgment when it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. <em>Kennedy v. Silas Mason Co.</em>, 334 U.S. 249, 256&ndash;257 (1948). Many lower court decisions are gathered in 10A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 3d, &sect;2728. &ldquo;Should&rdquo; in amended Rule 56(c) recognizes that courts will seldom exercise the discretion to deny summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Similarly sparing exercise of this discretion is appropriate under Rule 56(e)(2). Rule 56(d)(1), on the other hand, reflects the more open-ended discretion to decide whether it is practicable to determine what material facts are not genuinely at issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 56(d) used a variety of different phrases to express the Rule 56(c) standard for summary judgment&mdash;that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Amended Rule 56(d) adopts terms directly parallel to Rule 56(c).</p>
