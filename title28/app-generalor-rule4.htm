<p class="note-body">The title of RCFC 4 has been changed to more closely conform to FRCP 4(i). Other provisions of FRCP 4(i)&mdash;those dealing with service upon agencies, corporations, or officers of the United States&mdash;have not been made a part of this court's RCFC 4 because, in this court (with the exception of vaccine cases), only the United States is properly the named defendant. See RCFC 10(a).</p>
