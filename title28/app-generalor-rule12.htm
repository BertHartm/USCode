<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Presented.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The United States shall file its answer to the complaint within 60 days after service of the pleading in which the claim is asserted. After service of an answer containing a counterclaim, offset, or plea of fraud, plaintiff shall have 20 days within which to file a reply to the counterclaim, offset, or plea of fraud. If a reply to an answer or a responsive pleading to a third-party complaint or answer is ordered by the court, the reply or responsive pleading shall be filed within 20 days after service of the order unless the order otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Unless a different time is fixed by court order, the service of a motion permitted under this rule or RCFC 56 alters these periods of time, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> if the court denies or partially denies or partially allows the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits or the motion is withdrawn, the responsive pleading shall be filed within 10 days after notice of the court's action, or the date on which the motion is withdrawn, or by the date the response otherwise would have been due, whichever is later;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading shall be filed within 10 days after the service of the more definite statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) How Presented.</strong> Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) [not used]; (4) insufficiency of process, (5) insufficiency of service of process, (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (7) failure to join a party under RCFC 19. A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If <!-- PDFPage:400 -->a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in RCFC 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by RCFC 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.</strong> After the pleadings are closed, but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in RCFC 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by RCFC 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Preliminary Hearings.</strong> The defenses specifically enumerated in subdivision (b) of this rule, whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment mentioned in subdivision (c) of this rule shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Motion for More Definite Statement.</strong> If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after notice of the order or within such other time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Motion to Strike.</strong> Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Consolidation of Defenses in Motion.</strong> A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h)(2) of this rule on any of the grounds there stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person; or insufficiency of process, or insufficiency of service of process is waived (A) if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision (g), or (B) if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by RCFC 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a defense of failure to join a party indispensable under RCFC 19, and an objection of failure to state a legal defense to a claim, may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under RCFC 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">To more closely parallel FRCP 12, subdivisions (b) and (h) of the court's rule are enlarged by adding the defense of &ldquo;insufficiency of service of process&rdquo; and the defense of &ldquo;failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 19.&rdquo; Further, as an aid to practitioners, most of whom are familiar with practice in the district courts, the enumeration of defenses in subdivision (b) has been brought into conformity with the corresponding subdivision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Finally, subdivision (i) (&ldquo;Suspension of Discovery&rdquo;) is deleted. That subdivision is not part of the comparable federal rule, and its subject matter is more appropriately dealt with as a case management matter.</p>
