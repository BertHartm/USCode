<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;334 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;227, 36 Stat. 1154; Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 285, &sect;1, 36 Stat. 1419; July 1, 1922, ch. 267, &sect;3, 42 Stat. 816; June 12, 1926, ch. 568, 44 Stat. 736; Jan. 29, 1929, ch. 113, 45 Stat. 1143; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, &sect;1, 45 Stat. 1475; July 3, 1930, ch. 863, &sect;1, 46 Stat. 1016; Feb. 23, 1931, ch. 276, &sect;30, 46 Stat. 1214; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; June 30, 1932, ch. 314, &sect;501, 47 Stat. 415; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, &sect;512, 48 Stat. 758; Ex. Ord. No. 6166, &sect;&sect;12, 14, June 10, 1933; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; May 27, 1936, ch. 463, &sect;1, 49 Stat. 1380; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, &sect;5, 49 Stat. 1549; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921).</p>
<p class="note-body">Requirements for printing, binding, and issuing Supreme Court decisions &ldquo;within eight months after said decisions have been rendered by the Supreme Court&rdquo; and provision for distribution &ldquo;within said period&rdquo; were omitted. The phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable after rendition&rdquo; was made the time for publishing such decisions as more flexible and practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;the United States Court for China&rdquo; were omitted inasmuch as that court is no longer functioning. The Secretary of State by an arrangement with China has relinquished the extraterritorial jurisdiction previously exercised by the United States in China. The 1944 Legislative and Judiciary Appropriation Act approved June 28, 1943, made no appropriation for the United States Court for China. Appropriations for other courts were made in title II of chapter 173 (57 Stat. 241). The last appropriation for the United States Court for China was in the act of July 2, 1942 (ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 502).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;to the Secretary of War for the use of the proper courts and officers of the Philippine Islands, seven copies&rdquo; were omitted in view of the independence of the Philippines, effective July 4, 1946.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;justice or judge of the United States&rdquo; obviated repetition of names of courts. (See definitive section 451 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Last sentence, fourth paragraph, of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that books should remain the property of the United States and should be preserved and turned over to successors in office, was omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A reference to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by &ldquo;each United States attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision authorizing distribution of volumes under this section to each place where a court of appeals is held was added for purposes of uniformity. See similar provision in section 413 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in lieu of the Attorney General insofar as distribution of volumes to the judiciary is concerned. This change is consistent with the duties of the former under section 601 et seq. of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to the custody, use and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The limitation of 10 copies to the library of the Supreme Court and 6 copies to the marshal of the Supreme Court for use of the justices, was omitted and the provision for distribution in such number &ldquo;specified by the Chief Justice of the United States&rdquo; was substituted therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Acts July 1, 1922, ch. 267, &sect;5, 42 Stat. 818; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, &sect;3, 44 Stat. 678 which is omitted, but not repealed, as unnecessary in this revision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.</p>
