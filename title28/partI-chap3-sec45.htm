<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are sixty-four years of age or under;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have served for one year or more as a circuit judge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) have not served previously as chief judge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In any case in which no circuit judge meets the qualifications of paragraph (1), the youngest circuit judge in regular active service who is sixty-five years of age or over and who has served as circuit judge for one year or more shall act as the chief judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case under subparagraph (A) in which there is no circuit judge in regular active service who has served as a circuit judge for one year or more, the circuit judge in regular active service who is senior in commission and who has not served previously as chief judge shall act as the chief judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the chief judge of the circuit appointed under paragraph (1) shall serve for a term of seven years and shall serve after expiration of such term until another judge is eligible under paragraph (1) to serve as chief judge of the circuit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), a circuit judge acting as chief judge under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) shall serve until a judge has been appointed who meets the qualifications under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) No circuit judge may serve or act as chief judge of the circuit after attaining the age of seventy years unless no other circuit judge is qualified to serve as chief judge of the circuit under paragraph (1) or is qualified to act as chief judge under paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a chief judge is temporarily unable to perform his duties as such, they shall be performed by the circuit judge in active service, present in the circuit and able and qualified to act, who is next in precedence.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 216 and 216a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;120, 36 Stat. 1132; May 23, 1934, ch. 339, 48 Stat. 796).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a), providing for &ldquo;chief judge,&rdquo; is new. Such term is adopted to replace the term &ldquo;senior circuit judge&rdquo; in recognition of the great increase in administrative duties of such judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) conforms with section 4 of this title relating to precedence of associate justices of the Supreme Court, and consolidates the provisions of the second and third sentences of section 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The designation when filed in the court of appeals will not only record the transfer of function from the relieved chief judge to his successor, but will also determine the question of willingness of the successor to serve.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of section 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are covered by section 47 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is new.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is based on section 216a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The official status of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia holding office on the effective date of the act is preserved by section 2 of the bill to enact revised Title 28.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
