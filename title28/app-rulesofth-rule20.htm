<h3 class="section-head">Rule 20. Procedure on a Petition for an Extraordinary Writ</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. Issuance by the Court of an extraordinary writ authorized by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651(a) is not a matter of right, but of discretion sparingly exercised. To justify the granting of any such writ, the petition must show that the writ will be in aid of the Court's appellate jurisdiction, that exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. A petition seeking a writ authorized by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651(a), &sect;2241, or &sect;2254(a) shall be prepared in all respects as required by Rules 33 and 34. The petition shall be captioned &ldquo;<em>In re</em> [name of petitioner]&rdquo; and shall follow, insofar as appli<!-- PDFPage:393 -->cable, the form of a petition for a writ of certiorari prescribed by Rule 14. All contentions in support of the petition shall be included in the petition. The case will be placed on the docket when 40 copies of the petition are filed with the Clerk and the docket fee is paid, except that a petitioner proceeding <em>in forma pauperis</em> under Rule 39, including an inmate of an institution, shall file the number of copies required for a petition by such a person under Rule 12.2, together with a motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em>, a copy of which shall precede and be attached to each copy of the petition. The petition shall be served as required by Rule 29 (subject to subparagraph 4(b) of this Rule).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. (a) A petition seeking a writ of prohibition, a writ of mandamus, or both in the alternative shall state the name and office or function of every person against whom relief is sought and shall set out with particularity why the relief sought is not available in any other court. A copy of the judgment with respect to which the writ is sought, including any related opinion, shall be appended to the petition together with any other document essential to understanding the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The petition shall be served on every party to the proceeding with respect to which relief is sought. Within 30 days after the petition is placed on the docket, a party shall file 40 copies of any brief or briefs in opposition thereto, which shall comply fully with Rule 15. If a party named as a respondent does not wish to respond to the petition, that party may so advise the Clerk and all other parties by letter. All persons served are deemed respondents for all purposes in the proceedings in this Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. (a) A petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus shall comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2241 and 2242, and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of &sect;2242, which requires a statement of the &ldquo;reasons for not making application to the district court of the district in which the applicant is held.&rdquo; If the relief sought is from the judgment of a state court, the petition shall set out specifically how and where the petitioner has exhausted available remedies in the state courts or otherwise comes within the provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2254(b). To justify the granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must show that exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court. This writ is rarely granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Habeas corpus proceedings, except in capital cases, are <em>ex parte</em>, unless the Court requires the respondent to show cause why the petition for a writ of habeas corpus should not be granted. A response, if ordered, or in a capital case, shall comply fully with Rule 15. Neither the denial of the petition, without more, nor an order of transfer to a district court under the authority of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2241(b), is an adjudication on the merits, and therefore does not preclude further application to another court for the relief sought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. The Clerk will distribute the documents to the Court for its consideration when a brief in opposition under subparagraph 3(b) of this Rule has been filed, when a response under subparagraph 4(b) has been ordered and filed, when the time to file has expired, or when the right to file has been expressly waived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. If the Court orders the case set for argument, the Clerk will notify the parties whether additional briefs are required, when they shall be filed, and, if the case involves a petition for a common-law writ of certiorari, that the parties shall prepare a joint appendix in accordance with Rule 26.</p>
