<h3 class="section-head">Rule 63. Inability of a Judge to Proceed</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">If a trial or hearing has been commenced and the judge is unable to proceed, any other judge may proceed with it upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the proceedings in the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or trial without a jury, the successor judge shall at the request of a party recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify again without undue burden. The successor judge may also recall any other witness.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule adapts and extends the provisions of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;776 (Bill of exceptions; authentication; signing of by judge) to include all duties to be performed by the judge after verdict or judgment. The statute is therefore superseded.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The revision substantially displaces the former rule. The former rule was limited to the disability of the judge, and made no provision for disqualification or possible other reasons for the withdrawal of the judge during proceedings. In making provision for other circumstances, the revision is not intended to encourage judges to discontinue participation in a trial for any but compelling reasons. Cf. <em>United States v. Lane</em>, 708 F.2d 1394, 1395&ndash;1397 (9th cir. 1983). Manifestly, a substitution should not be made for the personal convenience of the court, and the reasons for a substitution should be stated on the record.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former rule made no provision for the withdrawal of the judge during the trial, but was limited to disqualification after trial. Several courts concluded that the text of the former rule prohibited substitution of a new judge prior to the points described in the rule, thus requiring a new trial, whether or not a fair disposition was within reach of a substitute judge. <em>E.g., Whalen v. Ford Motor Credit Co</em>., 684 F.2d 272 (4th Cir. 1982, en banc) <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 910 (1982) (jury trial); <em>Arrow-Hart, Inc. v. Philip Carey Co</em>., 552 F.2d 711 (6th Cir. 1977) (non-jury trial). <em>See generally</em> Comment, <em>The Case of the Dead Judge: Fed.R.Civ.P. 63: Whalen v. Ford Motor Credit Co</em>., 67 MINN. L. REV. 827 (1983).</p>
<p class="note-body">The increasing length of federal trials has made it likely that the number of trials interrupted by the disability of the judge will increase. An efficient mechanism for completing these cases without unfairness is needed to prevent unnecessary expense and delay. To avoid the injustice that may result if the substitute judge proceeds despite unfamiliarity with the action, the new Rule provides, in language similar to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a), that the successor judge must certify familiarity with the record and determine that the case may be completed before that judge without prejudice to the parties. This will necessarily require that there be available a transcript or a videotape of the proceedings prior to substitution. If there has been a long but incomplete jury trial, the prompt availability of the transcript or videotape is crucial to the effective use of this rule, for the jury cannot long be held while an extensive transcript is prepared without prejudice to one or all parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised text authorizes the substitute judge to make a finding of fact at a bench trial based on evidence heard by a different judge. This may be appropriate in limited circumstances. First, if a witness has become unavailable, the testimony recorded at trial can be considered by the successor judge pursuant to F.R.Ev. 804, being equivalent to a recorded deposition available for use at trial pursuant to Rule 32. For this purpose, a witness who is no longer subject to a subpoena to compel testimony at trial is unavailable. Secondly, the successor judge may determine that particular testimony is not material or is not disputed, and so need not be reheard. The propriety of proceeding in this manner may be marginally affected by the availability of a videotape record; a judge who has reviewed a trial on videotape may be entitled to greater confidence in his or her ability to proceed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court would, however, risk error to determine the credibility of a witness not seen or heard who is available to be recalled. Cf. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City NC</em>, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985); <em>Marshall v. Jerrico Inc</em>, 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980). See also <em>United States v. Radatz</em>, 447 U.S. 667 (1980).</p>
