<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Specifying Issues.</cap-smallcap> In its demand, a party may specify the issues that it wishes to have tried by a jury; otherwise, it is considered to have demanded a jury trial on all the issues so triable.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule provides for the preservation of the constitutional right of trial by jury as directed in the enabling act (act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;723c [see 2072]), and it and the next rule make definite provision for claim and waiver of jury trial, following the method used in many American states and in England and the British Dominions. Thus the claim must be made at once on initial pleading or appearance under Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;188; 6 Tenn.Code Ann. (Williams, 1934) &sect;8734; compare Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann. (1931) &sect;89&ndash;1320 (with answer or reply); within 10 days after the pleadings are completed or the case is at issue under 2 Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930) &sect;5624; Hawaii Rev.Laws (1935) &sect;4101; 2 Mass.Gen.Laws (Ter.Ed. 1932) ch. 231, &sect;60; 3 Mich.Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;14263; Mich.Court Rules Ann. (Searl, 1933) Rule 33 (15 days); England (until 1933) O. 36, r.r. 2 and 6; and Ontario Jud.Act (1927) &sect;57(1) (4 days, or, where prior notice of trial, 2 days from such notice); or at a definite time varying under different codes, from 10 days before notice of trial to 10 days after notice, or, as in many, when the case is called for assignment, Ariz.Rev.Code Ann. (Struckmeyer, 1928) &sect;3802; Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;631, par. 4; Iowa Code (1935) &sect;10724; 4 Nev.Comp.Laws (Hillyer, 1929) &sect;8782; N.M.Stat.Ann. (Courtright, 1929) &sect;105&ndash;814; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;426, subdivision 5 (applying to New York, Bronx, Richmond, Kings, and Queens Counties); R.I.Pub.Laws (1929), ch. 1327, amending R.I.Gen.Laws (1923) ch. 337, &sect;6; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933) &sect;104&ndash;23&ndash;6; 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann.

See James, <em>Trial by Jury and the New Federal Rules of Procedure</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 1022.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 81(c) provides for claim for jury trial in removed actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The right to trial by jury as declared in U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;770 [now 1873] (Trial of issues of fact; by jury; exceptions), and similar statutes, is unaffected by this rule. This rule modifies U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;773 (Trial of issues of fact; by court).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 38 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>

<p class="note-body">The times set in the former rule at 10 days have been revised to 14 days. See the Note to Rule 6.</p>
