<p class="statutory-body">Every document, whether prepared under Rule 33.1 or Rule 33.2, shall comply with the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">1. Each document shall bear on its cover, in the order indicated, from the top of the page:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) the docket number of the case or, if there is none, a space for one;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) the name of this Court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) the caption of the case as appropriate in this Court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) the nature of the proceeding and the name of the court from which the action is brought (<em>e.g</em>., &ldquo;On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit&rdquo;; or, for a merits brief, &ldquo;On Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit&rdquo;);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) the title of the document (<em>e.g</em>., &ldquo;Petition for Writ of Certiorari,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brief for Respondent,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joint Appendix&rdquo;);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) the name of the attorney who is counsel of record for the party concerned (who must be a member of the Bar of this Court except as provided in Rule 33.2), and on whom service is to be made, with a notation directly thereunder identifying the attorney as counsel of record and setting out counsel's office address and telephone number. Only one counsel of record may be noted on a single document. The names of other members of the Bar of this Court or of the bar of the highest court of a State acting as counsel, and, if desired, their addresses, may be added, but counsel of record shall be clearly identified. Names of persons other than attorneys admitted to a state bar may not be listed, unless the party is appearing <em>pro se</em>, in which case the party's name, address, and telephone number shall appear. The foregoing shall be displayed in an appropriate typographic manner and, except for the identification of counsel, may not be set in type smaller than standard 11-point, if the document is prepared as required by Rule 33.1.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">3. The body of every document shall bear at its close the name of counsel of record and such other counsel, identified on the cover of the document in conformity with subparagraph 1(g) of this Rule, as may be desired.</p>
