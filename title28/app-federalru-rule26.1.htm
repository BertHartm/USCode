<h3 class="section-head">Rule 26.1. Corporate Disclosure Statement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Any non-governmental corporate party to a civil or bankruptcy case or agency review proceeding and any non-governmental corporate defendant in a criminal case must file a statement identifying all parent companies, subsidiaries (except wholly-owned subsidiaries), and affiliates that have issued shares to the public. The statement must be filed with a party's principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the court of appeals, whichever first occurs, unless a local rule requires earlier filing. Whenever the statement is filed before a party's principal brief, an original and three copies of the statement must be filed unless the court requires the filing of a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case. The statement must be included in front of the table of contents in a party's principal brief even if the statement was previously filed.</p>

<p class="note-body">The purpose of this rule is to assist judges in making a determination of whether they have any interests in any of a party's related corporate entities that would disqualify the judges from hearing the appeal. The committee believes that this rule represents minimum disclosure requirements. If a Court of Appeals wishes to require additional information, a court is free to do so by local rule. However, the committee requests the courts to consider the desirability of uniformity and the burden that varying circuit rules creates on attorneys who practice in many circuits.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment requires a party to file three copies of the disclosure statement whenever the statement is <!-- PDFPage:31 -->filed before the party's principal brief. Because the statement is included in each copy of the party's brief, there is no need to require the filing of additional copies at that time. A court of appeals may require the filing of a different number of copies by local rule or by order in a particular case.</p>
