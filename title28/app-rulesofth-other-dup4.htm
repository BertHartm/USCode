<h3 class="section-head">Rule 21. Motions to the Court</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. Every motion to the Court shall clearly state its purpose and the facts on which it is based and may present legal argument in support thereof. No separate brief may be filed. A motion should be concise and shall comply with any applicable page limits. Rule 22 governs an application addressed to a single Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. (a) A motion in any action within the Court's original jurisdiction shall comply with Rule 17.3.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A motion to dismiss as moot (or a suggestion of mootness), a motion for leave to file a brief as <em>amicus curiae</em>, and any motion the granting of which would dispose of the entire case or would affect the final judgment to be entered (other than a motion to docket and dismiss under Rule 18.5 or a motion for voluntary dismissal under Rule 46) shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.1, and 40 copies shall be filed, except that a movant proceeding <em>in forma pauperis</em> under Rule 39, including an inmate of an institution, shall file a motion prepared as required by Rule 33.2, and shall file the number of copies required for a petition by such a person under Rule 12.2. The motion shall be served as required by Rule 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any other motion to the Court shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.2; the moving party shall file an original and 10 copies. The Court subsequently may order the moving party to prepare the motion as required by Rule 33.1; in that event, the party shall file 40 copies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. A motion to the Court shall be filed with the Clerk and shall be accompanied by proof of service as required by Rule 29. No motion may be presented in open Court, other than a motion for admission to the Bar, except when the proceeding to which it refers is being argued. Oral argument on a motion will not be permitted unless the Court so directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. Any response to a motion shall be filed as promptly as possible considering the nature of the relief sought and any asserted need for emergency action, and, in any event, within 10 days of receipt, unless the Court or a Justice, or the Clerk under Rule 30.4, orders otherwise. A response to a motion prepared as required by Rule 33.1, except a response to a motion for leave to file an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief (see Rule 37.5), shall be prepared in the same manner if time permits. In an appropriate case, the Court may act on a motion without waiting for a response.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 22. Applications to Individual Justices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. An application addressed to an individual Justice shall be filed with the Clerk, who will <!-- PDFPage:389 -->transmit it promptly to the Justice concerned if an individual Justice has authority to grant the sought relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. The original and two copies of any application addressed to an individual Justice shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.2, and shall be accompanied by proof of service as required by Rule 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. An application shall be addressed to the Justice allotted to the Circuit from which the case arises. When the Circuit Justice is unavailable for any reason, the application addressed to that Justice will be distributed to the Justice then available who is next junior to the Circuit Justice; the turn of the Chief Justice follows that of the most junior Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. A Justice denying an application will note the denial thereon. Thereafter, unless action thereon is restricted by law to the Circuit Justice or is untimely under Rule 30.2, the party making an application, except in the case of an application for an extension of time, may renew it to any other Justice, subject to the provisions of this Rule. Except when the denial is without prejudice, a renewed application is not favored. Renewed application is made by a letter to the Clerk, designating the Justice to whom the application is to be directed, and accompanied by 10 copies of the original application and proof of service as required by Rule 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. A Justice to whom an application for a stay or for bail is submitted may refer it to the Court for determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. The Clerk will advise all parties concerned, by appropriately speedy means, of the disposition made of an application.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 23. Stays</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. A stay may be granted by a Justice as permitted by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. A party to a judgment sought to be reviewed may present to a Justice an application to stay the enforcement of that judgment. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2101(f).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. An application for a stay shall set out with particularity why the relief sought is not available from any other court or judge. Except in the most extraordinary circumstances, an application for a stay will not be entertained unless the relief requested was first sought in the appropriate court or courts below or from a judge or judges thereof. An application for a stay shall identify the judgment sought to be reviewed and have appended thereto a copy of the order and opinion, if any, and a copy of the order, if any, of the court or judge below denying the relief sought, and shall set out specific reasons why a stay is justified. The form and content of an application for a stay are governed by Rules 22 and 33.2.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. A judge, court, or Justice granting an application for a stay pending review by this Court may condition the stay on the filing of a supersedeas bond having an approved surety or sureties. The bond will be conditioned on the satisfaction of the judgment in full, together with any costs, interest, and damages for delay that may be awarded. If a part of the judgment sought to be reviewed has already been satisfied, or is otherwise secured, the bond may be conditioned on the satisfaction of the part of the judgment not otherwise secured or satisfied, together with costs, interest, and damages.</p>
