<p class="note-body">The section is revised and reorganized for clarity. The words &ldquo;now or hereafter provided&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;for expenses of membership in the International Commission of Criminal Police and&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The Act of Aug. 27, 1958, Pub. L. 85&ndash;768, 72 Stat. 921 (22 U.S.C. 263a) authorizes the Attorney General to accept and maintain, on behalf of the United States, membership in the International Criminal Police Organization, and to designate any departments and agencies which may participate in the United States representation with that organization; and authorizes each participating department and agency to pay its pro rata share, as determined by the Attorney General, of the expenses of such membership. The word &ldquo;spent&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;expended&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;certify the amount spent that he considers&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;make a certificate of the amount of any such expenditure as he may think it&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;his certification is a sufficient voucher&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and every such certificate shall be deemed a sufficient voucher&rdquo;.</p>
