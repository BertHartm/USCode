All attorneys who were members in good standing of the bar of the United States Court of Claims are eligible to practice herein. See RCFC 83.1(c)(2) concerning authorization to sign filings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Admission to Practice.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Qualifications; Oath.</strong> Any person of good moral character who has been admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the highest court of any state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia, and is in good standing therein, may be admitted to practice before this court upon oral motion or by verified application, as provided in this rule, and upon taking or subscribing to the following oath: I, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and that I will conduct myself in an upright manner as an attorney of this court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Upon Oral Motion.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A) In Washington, D.C.</strong> An oral motion for admission may be made by a member of the bar of this court before any judge, and the judge or the clerk shall administer the oath.

<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B) Outside Washington, D.C.</strong> An oral motion for admission may be made by a member of the bar of this court before a judge outside Washington, D.C., who shall administer the oath. As a preliminary to the motion, the attorney who moves the admission shall submit to the judge the appropriate form obtained from the judge and completed <!-- PDFPage:446 -->by the applicant. In the absence of an oral motion for admission in conformity with this subdivision, the applicant may advise the judge of the applicant's qualifications as set forth in subdivision (b)(1). Upon consideration thereof, and upon representation by the attorney that such attorney will promptly apply to the clerk for admission by verified application as provided in subdivision (b)(3), the judge may permit the applicant to participate in the particular proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) By Verified Application.</strong> Without need for appearing in person, admission may be made upon presentation to the clerk of a verified application showing that the applicant is possessed of the qualifications described in subdivision (b)(1). See Appendix of Forms, Form 1. The application shall be accompanied by: (A) a certificate of a judge or of the clerk of any of the courts specified in subdivision (b)(1) indicating that the applicant is a member of the bar of such court and is in good standing therein; (B) two letters or signed statements of members of the bar of this court or of the Supreme Court of the United States, not related to the applicant, affirming that the applicant is personally known to them, that the applicant possesses all the qualifications required for admission to the bar of this court, that they have examined the application, and that the applicant's personal and professional character and standing are good; and (C) an oath in the form prescribed in subdivision (b)(1) signed by the applicant and administered by an officer authorized to administer oaths in the state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia, where the oath is administered, or as permitted by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Fee for Admission.</strong> Unless the applicant is an attorney representing the United States before this court, an admission fee as provided for in RCFC 77.1 (c)(2) shall be paid in advance in cash or by check payable to &ldquo;Clerk, United States Court of Federal Claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Admission of Foreign Attorneys.</strong> An attorney, barrister, or advocate who is qualified to practice in the highest court of any foreign state may be specially admitted for purposes limited to a particular case. Such attorney, barrister or advocate shall not, however, be authorized to act as attorney of record. In the case of such applicants, the oath shall not be required and there shall be no fee. Such admission shall be only on written motion of a member of the bar of this court, filed with the clerk at least 3 days prior to the consideration of the motion by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Attorneys of Record.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) One for Each Party.</strong> There shall be but one attorney of record for a party in any case at any one time, and such attorney of record shall be an individual (and not a firm) who has been admitted to practice before this court. Any other attorneys assisting the attorney of record shall be designated as &ldquo;of counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Authorization to Sign Filings.</strong> Any attorney who is a member of the bar of this court may sign any filing in the attorney of record's name. An attorney who signs the name of the attorney of record shall so indicate by adding the following after the name of the attorney of record: &ldquo;by [the signing attorney's full name].&rdquo; Authorization to sign filings shall not relieve the attorney of record from the provisions of RCFC 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Appearance.</strong> For parties other than the United States, the attorney of record shall include on the initial pleading or paper said attorney's name, address, telephone, and facsimile number. For the United States the attorney who is to appear as the attorney of record shall, promptly after service of the complaint, file with the clerk and serve on all other parties a notice of appearance setting forth the identical information. The attorneys of record for all parties shall promptly file with the clerk and serve on all other parties a notice of any change in address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Change by Parties Other than the United States.</strong> A party other than the United States may by leave of court on motion change the party's attorney at any time. The motion may be signed by said party in person or by the newly designated attorney accompanied by an affidavit of appointment executed by such attorney. If the consent of the previous attorney of record is annexed to or endorsed on the motion, substitution shall be accomplished by an appropriate entry on the docket by the clerk.

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Change by the United States.</strong> A new notice of appearance shall be filed and served on all parties by the United States whenever a case is reassigned to another attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Withdrawal of Attorney.</strong> No attorney of record for a plaintiff or a third party may withdraw such attorney's appearance except by leave of the court on motion and after notice is served on such attorney's client.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7) Death of Attorney.</strong> If the attorney of record dies, a suggestion of such attorney's death shall be made, and a motion to substitute another attorney admitted to practice before this court may be made by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(8) Unrepresented Party.</strong> An individual may represent oneself or a member of one's immediate family as a party before the court. Any other party, however, must be represented by an attorney who is admitted to practice in this court. A corporation may only be represented by counsel. The terms counsel or attorney in these rules shall include unrepresented parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Honorary Membership.</strong> Honorary membership in the bar of the court may be granted from time to time to distinguished professionals of the United States or of other nations who are knowledgeable in the affairs of law and government in their respective countries.

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule has no FRCP counterpart. Former RCFC 83.1 (&ldquo;Content of Briefs or Memoranda; Length of Briefs or Memoranda&rdquo;) has been renumbered as RCFC 5.2. The renumbering of RCFC 83.1 was intended to reflect its more logical placement in the organizational structure of this court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The substance of the rule reflects the text of former RCFC 81, as modified. Paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) (formerly paragraph (d)(2) of RCFC 81) was amended to formalize the court's practice of allowing joint filings to be signed by one counsel, on behalf of both counsel, when authorized to do so by opposing counsel. Also, subdivision (e) of former RCFC 81 (relating to attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses) was not retained as part of this rule but was, instead, incorporated into RCFC 54(d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, former General Order No. 15, &ldquo;Honorary Bar Membership,&rdquo; was slightly modified and moved to new subdivision 83.1(d).</p>
