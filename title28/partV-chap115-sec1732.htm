Such reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, is as admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding whether the original is in existence or not and an enlargement or facsimile of such reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspection under direction of court. The introduction of a reproduced record, enlargement, or facsimile does not preclude admission of the original. This subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1732_1_target" name="1732_1">1</a></sup> shall not be construed to exclude from evidence any document or copy thereof which is otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence.</p>
