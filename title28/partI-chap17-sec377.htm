<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) may be made by a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge eligible for retirement under this section, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Such an election, once it takes effect, shall be irrevocable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Any election under this subparagraph shall take effect on the first day of the first month following the month in which the election is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Recall not permitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who retires under this section and who thereafter practices law shall not be eligible for recall under section 155(b), 375, or 636(h) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If all annuity rights under this section based on the service of a deceased bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) If a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who is receiving an annuity under this section dies, annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge shall be paid to that individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Subject to paragraph (2), a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who forfeits rights to an annuity under subsection (m)(3) before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, shall be entitled to be paid the difference if the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge files an application with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for payment of that difference. A payment under this subparagraph voids all rights to an annuity on which the payment is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Spouses and former spouses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Payment of the lump-sum credit under paragraph (1)(A) or a payment under paragraph (1)(G)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) may be made only if any current spouse and any former spouse of the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge are notified of the bankruptcy judge's or magistrate judge's application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall be subject to the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or any court or court approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the decree, order, or agreement expressly relates to any portion of the lump-sum credit or other payment involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) payment of the lump-sum credit or other payment would extinguish entitlement of the bankruptcy judge's or magistrate judge's spouse or former spouse to any portion of an annuity under subsection (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notification of a spouse or former spouse under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall by regulation prescribe. The Director may provide under such regulations that subparagraph (A)(i) may be waived with respect to a spouse or former spouse if the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that <!-- PDFPage:135 -->the whereabouts of such spouse or former spouse cannot be determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Director shall prescribe regulations under which this paragraph shall be applied in any case in which the Director receives two or more orders or decrees described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;lump-sum credit&rdquo; means the unrefunded amount consisting of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) retirement deductions made under this section from the salary of a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) amounts deposited under subsection (k) by a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge covering earlier service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) interest on the deductions and deposits which, for any calendar year, shall be equal to the overall average yield to the Judicial Officers&rsquo; Retirement Fund during the preceding fiscal year from all obligations purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury during such fiscal year under subsection (<em>o</em>);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but does not include interest&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for the fractional part of a month in the total service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Officers&rsquo; Retirement Fund.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is established in the Treasury a fund which shall be known as the &ldquo;Judicial Officers&rsquo; Retirement Fund&rdquo;. The Fund is appropriated for the payment of annuities, refunds, and other payments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Investment of fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest, in interest bearing securities of the United States, such currently available portions of the Judicial Officers&rsquo; Retirement Fund as are not immediately required for payments from the Fund. The income derived from these investments constitutes a part of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Unfunded liability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Judicial Officers&rsquo; Retirement Fund amounts required to reduce to zero the unfunded liability of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;unfunded liability&rdquo; means the estimated excess, determined on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of section 9503 of title 31, of the present value of all benefits payable from the Judicial Officers&rsquo; Retirement Fund over the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the present value of deductions to be withheld under this section from the future basic pay of bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the balance in the Fund as of the date the unfunded liability is determined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In making any determination under this subparagraph, the Comptroller General shall use the applicable information contained in the reports filed pursuant to section 9503 of title 31, with respect to the retirement annuities provided for in this section.</p>
