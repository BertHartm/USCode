<h3 class="section-head">Rule 22. Interpleader</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff avers that the plaintiff is not liable in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants. A defendant exposed to similar liability may obtain such interpleader by way of cross-claim or counterclaim. The provisions of this rule supplement and do not in any way limit the joinder of parties permitted in Rule 20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The remedy herein provided is in addition to and in no way supersedes or limits the remedy provided by Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;&sect;1335, 1397, and 2361. Actions under those provisions shall be conducted in accordance with these rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first paragraph provides for interpleader relief along the newer and more liberal lines of joinder in the alternative. It avoids the confusion and restrictions that developed around actions of strict interpleader and actions in the nature of interpleader. Compare <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Kegan et al</em>., (D.C.Md., 1938) [22 F.Supp. 326]. It does not change the rules on service of process, jurisdiction, and venue, as established by judicial decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph allows an action to be brought under the recent interpleader statute when applicable. By this paragraph all remedies under the statute are <!-- PDFPage:108 -->continued, but the manner of obtaining them is in accordance with these rules. For temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions under this statute, see Rule 65(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule substantially continues such statutory provisions as U.S.C., Title 38, &sect;445 [now 1984] (Actions on claims; jurisdiction; parties; procedure; limitation; witnesses; definitions) (actions upon veterans&rsquo; contracts of insurance with the United States), providing for interpleader by the United States where it acknowledges indebtedness under a contract of insurance with the United States; U.S.C., Title 49, &sect;97 [now 80110(e)] (Interpleader of conflicting claimants) (by carrier which has issued bill of lading). See Chafee, <em>The Federal Interpleader Act of 1936: I and II</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 963, 1161.</p>
