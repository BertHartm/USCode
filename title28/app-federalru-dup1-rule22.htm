<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Grounds.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>By a Plaintiff.</em> Persons with claims that may expose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as defendants and required to interplead. Joinder for interpleader is proper even though:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the claims of the several claimants, or the titles on which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse and independent rather than identical; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the plaintiff denies liability in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>By a Defendant.</em> A defendant exposed to similar liability may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Relation to Other Rules and Statutes.</cap-smallcap> This rule supplements&mdash;and does not limit&mdash;the joinder of parties allowed by Rule 20. The remedy this rule provides is in addition to&mdash;and does not supersede or limit&mdash;the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1335, 1397, and 2361. An action under those statutes must be conducted under these rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first paragraph provides for interpleader relief along the newer and more liberal lines of joinder in the alternative. It avoids the confusion and restrictions that developed around actions of strict interpleader and actions in the nature of interpleader. Compare <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Kegan et al</em>., (D.C.Md., 1938) [22 F.Supp. 326]. It does not change the rules on service of process, jurisdiction, and venue, as established by judicial decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph allows an action to be brought under the recent interpleader statute when applicable. By this paragraph all remedies under the statute are continued, but the manner of obtaining them is in accordance with these rules. For temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions under this statute, see Rule 65(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule substantially continues such statutory provisions as U.S.C., Title 38, &sect;445 [now 1984] (Actions on claims; jurisdiction; parties; procedure; limitation; witnesses; definitions) (actions upon veterans&rsquo; contracts of insurance with the United States), providing for inter<!-- PDFPage:153 -->pleader by the United States where it acknowledges indebtedness under a contract of insurance with the United States; U.S.C., Title 49, &sect;97 [now 80110(e)] (Interpleader of conflicting claimants) (by carrier which has issued bill of lading). See Chafee, <em>The Federal Interpleader Act of 1936: I and II</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 963, 1161.</p>
