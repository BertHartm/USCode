<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. Rule 5(e) defines what constitutes filing with the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This rule governs the commencement of all actions, including those brought by or against the United States or an officer or agency thereof, regardless of whether service is to be made personally pursuant to Rule 4(d), or otherwise pursuant to Rule 4(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">3. With this rule compare [former] Equity Rule 12 (Issue of Subpoena&mdash;Time for Answer) and the following statutes (and other similar statutes) which provide a similar method for commencing an action:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 28:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;45 [former] (District courts; practice and procedure in certain cases under interstate commerce laws).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;762 [see 1402] (Petition in suit against United States).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;766 [see 2409] (Partition suits where United States is tenant in common or joint tenant).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body">4. This rule provides that the first step in an action is the filing of the complaint. Under Rule 4(a) this is to be followed forthwith by issuance of a summons and its delivery to an officer for service. Other rules providing for dismissal for failure to prosecute suggest a method available to attack unreasonable delay in prosecuting an action after it has been commenced. When a Federal or State statute of limitations is pleaded as a defense, a question may arise under this rule whether the mere filing of the complaint stops the running of the statute, or whether any further step is required, such as, service of the summons and complaint or their delivery to the marshal for service. The answer to this question may depend on whether it is competent for the Supreme Court, exercising the power to make rules of procedure without affecting substantive rights, to vary the operation of statutes of limitations. The requirement of Rule 4(a) that the clerk shall forthwith issue the summons and deliver it to the marshal for service will reduce the chances of such a question arising.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 4. Summons</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Form</cap-smallcap>. The summons shall be signed by the clerk, bear the seal of the court, identify the court and the parties, be directed to the defendant, and state the name and address of the plaintiff's attorney or, if unrepresented, of the plaintiff. It shall also state the time within which the defendant must appear and defend, and notify the defendant that failure to do so will result in a judgment by default against the defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint. The court may allow a summons to be amended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>. Upon or after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal. If the summons is in proper form, the clerk shall sign, seal, and issue it to the plaintiff for service on the defendant. A summons, or a copy of the summons if addressed to multiple defendants, shall be issued for each defendant to be served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service with Complaint; by Whom Made.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A summons shall be served together with a copy of the complaint. The plaintiff is responsible for service of a summons and complaint within the time allowed under subdivision (m) and shall furnish the person effecting service with the necessary copies of the summons and complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Service may be effected by any person who is not a party and who is at least 18 years of age. At the request of the plaintiff, however, the court may direct that service be effected by a United States marshal, deputy United States marshal, or other person or officer specially appointed by the court for that purpose. Such an appointment must be made when the plaintiff is authorized to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1915 or is authorized to proceed as a seaman under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1916.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Service; Duty to Save Costs of Service; Request to Waive.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A defendant who waives service of a summons does not thereby waive any objection to the venue or to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An individual, corporation, or association that is subject to service under subdivision (e), (f), or (h) and that receives notice of an action <!-- PDFPage:82 -->in the manner provided in this paragraph has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of serving the summons. To avoid costs, the plaintiff may notify such a defendant of the commencement of the action and request that the defendant waive service of a summons. The notice and request</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be in writing and shall be addressed directly to the defendant, if an individual, or else to an officer or managing or general agent (or other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service of process) of a defendant subject to service under subdivision (h);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be dispatched through first-class mail or other reliable means;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall be accompanied by a copy of the complaint and shall identify the court in which it has been filed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall inform the defendant, by means of a text prescribed in an official form promulgated pursuant to Rule 84, of the consequences of compliance and of a failure to comply with the request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) shall set forth the date on which the request is sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) shall allow the defendant a reasonable time to return the waiver, which shall be at least 30 days from the date on which the request is sent, or 60 days from that date if the defendant is addressed outside any judicial district of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) shall provide the defendant with an extra copy of the notice and request, as well as a prepaid means of compliance in writing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If a defendant located within the United States fails to comply with a request for waiver made by a plaintiff located within the United States, the court shall impose the costs subsequently incurred in effecting service on the defendant unless good cause for the failure be shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A defendant that, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver so requested is not required to serve an answer to the complaint until 60 days after the date on which the request for waiver of service was sent, or 90 days after that date if the defendant was addressed outside any judicial district of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) When the plaintiff files a waiver of service with the court, the action shall proceed, except as provided in paragraph (3), as if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing the waiver, and no proof of service shall be required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The costs to be imposed on a defendant under paragraph (2) for failure to comply with a request to waive service of a summons shall include the costs subsequently incurred in effecting service under subdivision (e), (f), or (h), together with the costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, of any motion required to collect the costs of service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Individuals Within a Judicial District of the United States</cap-smallcap>. Unless otherwise provided by federal law, service upon an individual from whom a waiver has not been obtained and filed, other than an infant or an incompetent person, may be effected in any judicial district of the United States:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) pursuant to the law of the state in which the district court is located, or in which service is effected, for the service of a summons upon the defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the individual personally or by leaving copies thereof at the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein or by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Individuals in a Foreign Country</cap-smallcap>. Unless otherwise provided by federal law, service upon an individual from whom a waiver has not been obtained and filed, other than an infant or an incompetent person, may be effected in a place not within any judicial district of the United States:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by any internationally agreed means reasonably calculated to give notice, such as those means authorized by the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if there is no internationally agreed means of service or the applicable international agreement allows other means of service, provided that service is reasonably calculated to give notice:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the manner prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that country in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory or letter of request; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) unless prohibited by the law of the foreign country, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) delivery to the individual personally of a copy of the summons and the complaint; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the party to be served; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by other means not prohibited by international agreement as may be directed by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Infants and Incompetent Persons</cap-smallcap>. Service upon an infant or an incompetent person in a judicial district of the United States shall be effected in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the service is made for the service of summons or other like process upon any such defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state. Service upon an infant or an incompetent person in a place not within any judicial district of the United States shall be effected in the manner prescribed by paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of subdivision (f) or by such means as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Corporations and Associations</cap-smallcap>. Unless otherwise provided by federal law, service upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a common name, and from which a waiver of service <!-- PDFPage:83 -->has not been obtained and filed, shall be effected:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in a judicial district of the United States in the manner prescribed for individuals by subdivision (e)(1), or by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and, if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a place not within any judicial district of the United States in any manner prescribed for individuals by subdivision (f) except personal delivery as provided in paragraph (2)(C)(i) thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Serving the United States, Its Agencies, Corporations, Officers, or Employees.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Service upon the United States shall be effected</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the United States attorney for the district in which the action is brought or to an assistant United States attorney or clerical employee designated by the United States attorney in a writing filed with the clerk of the court or by sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail addressed to the civil process clerk at the office of the United States attorney and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by also sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, District of Columbia, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in any action attacking the validity of an order of an officer or agency of the United States not made a party, by also sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to the officer or agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Service on an agency or corporation of the United States, or an officer or employee of the United States sued only in an official capacity, is effected by serving the United States in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(i)(1) and by also sending a copy of the summons and complaint by registered or certified mail to the officer, employee, agency, or corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Service on an officer or employee of the United States sued in an individual capacity for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the performance of duties on behalf of the United States&mdash;whether or not the officer or employee is sued also in an official capacity&mdash;is effected by serving the United States in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(i)(1) and by serving the officer or employee in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(e), (f), or (g).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The court shall allow a reasonable time to serve process under Rule 4(i) for the purpose of curing the failure to serve:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all persons required to be served in an action governed by Rule 4(i)(2)(A), if the plaintiff has served either the United States attorney or the Attorney General of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the United States in an action governed by Rule 4(i)(2)(B), if the plaintiff has served an officer or employee of the United States sued in an individual capacity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Foreign, State, or Local Governments.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Service upon a foreign state or a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof shall be effected pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1608.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Service upon a state, municipal corporation, or other governmental organization subject to suit shall be effected by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to its chief executive officer or by serving the summons and complaint in the manner prescribed by the law of that state for the service of summons or other like process upon any such defendant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Territorial Limits of Effective Service.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service is effective to establish jurisdiction over the person of a defendant</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) who could be subjected to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the district court is located, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) who is a party joined under Rule 14 or Rule 19 and is served at a place within a judicial district of the United States and not more than 100 miles from the place from which the summons issues, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) who is subject to the federal interpleader jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1335, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) when authorized by a statute of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service is also effective, with respect to claims arising under federal law, to establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) <cap-smallcap>Proof of Service</cap-smallcap>. If service is not waived, the person effecting service shall make proof thereof to the court. If service is made by a person other than a United States marshal or deputy United States marshal, the person shall make affidavit thereof. Proof of service in a place not within any judicial district of the United States shall, if effected under paragraph (1) of subdivision (f), be made pursuant to the applicable treaty or convention, and shall, if effected under paragraph (2) or (3) thereof, include a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence of delivery to the addressee satisfactory to the court. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service. The court may allow proof of service to be amended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Time Limit for Service</cap-smallcap>. If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall <!-- PDFPage:84 -->extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision does not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (f) or (j)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) <cap-smallcap>Seizure of Property; Service of Summons Not Feasible.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If a statute of the United States so provides, the court may assert jurisdiction over property. Notice to claimants of the property shall then be sent in the manner provided by the statute or by service of a summons under this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Upon a showing that personal jurisdiction over a defendant cannot, in the district where the action is brought, be obtained with reasonable efforts by service of summons in any manner authorized by this rule, the court may assert jurisdiction over any of the defendant's assets found within the district by seizing the assets under the circumstances and in the manner provided by the law of the state in which the district court is located.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. With the provision permitting additional summons upon request of the plaintiff compare [former] Equity Rule 14 (Alias Subpoena) and the last sentence of [former] Equity Rule 12 (Issue of Subpoena&mdash;Time for Answer).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. This rule prescribes a form of summons which follows substantially the requirements stated in [former] Equity Rules 12 (Issue of Subpoena&mdash;Time for Answer) and 7 (Process, Mesne and Final).</p>
<p class="note-body">U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;721 [now 1691] (Sealing and testing of writs) is substantially continued insofar as it applies to a summons, but its requirements as to teste of process are superseded. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;722 (Teste of process, day of), is superseded.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 12(a) for a statement of the time within which the defendant is required to appear and defend.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c)</em>. This rule does not affect U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;503 [see 566], as amended June 15, 1935 (Marshals; duties) and such statutes as the following insofar as they provide for service of process by a marshal, but modifies them insofar as they may imply service by a marshal only:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 15:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;5 (Bringing in additional parties) (Sherman Act)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;10 (Bringing in additional parties)</p>

<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;45 [former] (Practice and procedure in certain cases under the interstate commerce laws)</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body">Compare [former] Equity Rule 15 (Process, by Whom Served).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. Under this rule the complaint must always be served with the summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1). For an example of a statute providing for service upon an agent of an individual see U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;109 [now 1400, 1694] (Patent cases).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3). This enumerates the officers and agents of a corporation or of a partnership or other unincorporated association upon whom service of process may be made, and permits service of process only upon the officers, managing or general agents, or agents authorized by appointment or by law, of the corporation, partnership or unincorporated association against which the action is brought. See <em>Christian v. International Ass'n of Machinists</em>, 7 F.(2d) 481 (D.C.Ky., 1925) and <em>Singleton v. Order of Railway Conductors of America</em>, 9 F.Supp. 417 (D.C.Ill., 1935). Compare <em>Operative Plasterers&rsquo; and Cement Finishers&rsquo; International Ass'n of the United States and Canada v. Case</em>, 93 F.(2d) 56 (App.D.C., 1937).</p>
<p class="note-body">For a statute authorizing service upon a specified agent and requiring mailing to the defendant, see U.S.C., Title 6, &sect;7 [now Title 31, &sect;9306] (Surety companies as sureties; appointment of agents; service of process).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (4) and (5) provide a uniform and comprehensive method of service for all actions against the United States or an officer or agency thereof. For statutes providing for such service, see U.S.C., Title 7, &sect;&sect;217 (Proceedings for suspension of orders), 499k (Injunctions; application of injunction laws governing orders of Interstate Commerce Commission), 608c(15)(B) (Court review of ruling of Secretary of Agriculture), and 855 (making &sect;608c(15)(B) applicable to orders of the Secretary of Agriculture as to handlers of anti-hog-cholera serum and hog-cholera virus); U.S.C., Title 26, [former] &sect;1569 (Bill in chancery to clear title to realty on which the United States has a lien for taxes); U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;45 (District Courts; practice and procedure in certain cases under the interstate commerce laws), [former] 763 (Petition in suit against the United States; service; appearance by district attorney), 766 [now 2409] (Partition suits where United States is tenant in common or joint tenant), 902 [now 2410] (Foreclosure of mortgages or other liens on property in which the United States has an interest). These and similar statutes are modified insofar as they prescribe a different method of service or dispense with the service of a summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the [former] Equity Rule on service, see [former] Equity Rule 13 (Manner of Serving Subpoena).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e)</em>. The provisions for the service of a summons or of notice or of an order in lieu of summons contained in U.S.C., Title 8, &sect;405 [see 1451] (Cancellation of certificates of citizenship fraudulently or illegally procured) (service by publication in accordance with State law); U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;118 [now 1655] (Absent defendants in suits to enforce liens); U.S.C., Title 35, &sect;72a [now 146, 291] (Jurisdiction of District Court of United States for the District of Columbia in certain equity suits where adverse parties reside elsewhere) (service by publication against parties residing in foreign countries); U.S.C., Title 38, &sect;445 [now 1984] (Action against the United States on a veteran's contract of insurance) (parties not inhabitants of or not found within the District may be served with an order of the court, personally or by publication) and similar statutes are continued by this rule.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Under amended subdivision (e) of this rule, an action may be commenced against a nonresident of the State in which the district court is held by complying with State procedures. Frequently the form of the summons or notice required in these cases by State law differs from the Federal form of summons described in present subdivision (b) and exemplified in Form 1. To avoid confusion, the amendment of subdivision (b) states that a form of summons or notice, corresponding &ldquo;as nearly as may be&rdquo; to the State form, shall be employed. See also a corresponding amendment of Rule 12(a) with regard to the time to answer.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(4)</em>. This paragraph, governing service upon the United States, is amended to allow the use of certified mail as an alternative to registered mail for sending copies of the papers to the Attorney General or to a United States officer or agency. Cf. N.J. Rule 4:5&ndash;2. See also the amendment of Rule 30(f)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(7)</em>. Formerly a question was raised whether this paragraph, in the context of the rule as a whole, authorized service in original Federal actions pursuant to State statutes permitting service on a State official as a means of bringing a nonresident motorist defendant into court. It was argued in <em>McCoy v. Siler</em>, 205 F.2d 498, 501&ndash;2 (3d Cir.) (concurring opinion), <em>cert. denied</em>, 346 U.S. 872, 74 S.Ct. 120, 98 L.Ed. 380 (1953), that the effective service in those cases occurred not when the State official was served but when notice was given to the defendant outside the State, and that subdivision (f) (Territorial limits of effective service), as then worded, did not authorize out-of-State service. This contention found little support. A considerable number of cases held the service to be good, either by fixing upon the service on the official within the State as the effective service, thus satisfying the wording of subdivision (f) as it then stood, see <em>Holbrook v. Cafiero</em>, 18 F.R.D. 218 (D.Md. 1955); <em>Pasternack v. Dalo</em>, 17 F.R.D. 420; (W.D.Pa. 1955); cf. <em>Super Prods. Corp. v. Parkin</em>, 20 F.R.D. 377 (S.D.N.Y. 1957), or by reading paragraph (7) as not limited by subdivision (f). See <em>Griffin v. Ensign</em>, 234 F.2d 307 (3d Cir. 1956); 2 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, &nbsp;4.19 (2d ed. 1948); 1 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;182.1 (Wright ed. 1960); Comment, 27 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 751 (1960). See also <em>Olberding v. Illinois Central R.R</em>., 201 F.2d 582 (6th Cir.), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, 346 U.S. 338, 74 S.Ct. 83, 98 L.Ed. 39 (1953); <em>Feinsinger v. Bard</em>, 195 F.2d 45 (7th Cir. 1952).</p>
<p class="note-body">An important and growing class of State statutes base personal jurisdiction over nonresidents on the doing of acts or on other contacts within the State, and permit notice to be given the defendant outside the State without any requirement of service on a local State official. See, e.g., Ill.Ann.Stat. ch. 110, &sect;&sect;16, 17 (Smith-Hurd 1956); Wis.Stat. &sect;262.06 (1959). This service, employed in original Federal actions pursuant to paragraph (7), has also been held proper. See <em>Farr & Co. v. Cia. Intercontinental de Nav. de Cuba</em>, 243 F.2d 342 (2d Cir. 1957); <em>Kappus v. Western Hills Oil, Inc</em>., 24 F.R.D. 123 (E.D.Wis. 1959); <em>Star v. Rogalny</em>, 162 F.Supp. 181 (E.D.Ill. 1957). It has also been held that the clause of paragraph (7) which permits service &ldquo;in the manner prescribed by the law of the state,&rdquo; etc., is not limited by subdivision (c) requiring that service of all process be made by certain designated persons. See <em>Farr & Co. v. Cia. Intercontinental de Nav. de Cuba, supra. But cf. Sappia v. Lauro Lines</em>, 130 F.Supp. 810 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).</p>
<p class="note-body">The salutary results of these cases are intended to be preserved. See paragraph (7), with a clarified reference to State law, and amended subdivisions (e) and (f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. For the general relation between subdivisions (d) and (e), see 2 Moore, <em>supra</em>, &nbsp;4.32.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of the first sentence inserting the word &ldquo;thereunder&rdquo; supports the original intention that the &ldquo;order of court&rdquo; must be authorized by a specific United States statute. See 1 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, at 731. The clause added at the end of the first sentence expressly adopts the view taken by commentators that, if no manner of service is prescribed in the statute or order, the service may be made in a manner stated in Rule 4. See 2 Moore, <em>supra</em>, &nbsp;4.32, at 1004; Smit, <em>International Aspects of Federal Civil Procedure</em>, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1031, 1036&ndash;39 (1961). <em>But see </em>Commentary, 5 Fed. Rules Serv. 791 (1942).</p>
<p class="note-body">Examples of the statutes to which the first sentence relates are 28 U.S.C. &sect;2361 (Interpleader; process and procedure); 28 U.S.C. &sect;1655 (Lien enforcement; absent defendants).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence, added by amendment, expressly allows resort in original Federal actions to the procedures provided by State law for effecting service on nonresident parties (as well as on domiciliaries not found within the State). See, as illustrative, the discussion under amended subdivision (d)(7) of service pursuant to State nonresident motorist statutes and other comparable State statutes. Of particular interest is the change brought about by the reference in this sentence to State procedures for commencing actions against nonresidents by attachment and the like, accompanied by notice. Although an action commenced in a State court by attachment may be removed to the Federal court if ordinary conditions for removal are satisfied, see 28 U.S.C. &sect;1450; <em>Rorick v. Devon Syndicate, Ltd</em>., 307 U.S. 299, 59 S.Ct. 877, 83 L.Ed. 1303 (1939); <em>Clark v. Wells</em>, 203 U.S. 164, 27 S.Ct. 43, 51 L.Ed. 138 (1906), there has heretofore been no provision recognized by the courts for commencing an original Federal civil action by attachment. See Currie, <em>Attachment and Garnishment in the Federal Courts</em>, 59 Mich.L.Rev. 337 (1961), arguing that this result came about through historical anomaly. Rule 64, which refers to attachment, garnishment, and similar procedures under State law, furnishes only provisional remedies in actions otherwise validly commenced. See <em>Big Vein Coal Co. v. Read</em>, 229 U.S. 31, 33 S.Ct. 694, 57 L.Ed. 1953 (1913); <em>Davis v. Ensign-Bickford Co</em>., 139 F.2d 624 (8th Cir. 1944); 7 <em>Moore's Federal Practice </em>&nbsp;64.05 (2d ed. 1954); 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure </em>&sect;1423 (Wright ed. 1958); but cf. Note, 13 So.Calif.L.Rev. 361 (1940). The amendment will now permit the institution of original Federal actions against nonresidents through the use of familiar State procedures by which property of these defendants is brought within the custody of the court and some appropriate service is made up them.</p>
<p class="note-body">The necessity of satisfying subject-matter jurisdictional requirements and requirements of venue will limit the practical utilization of these methods of effecting service. Within those limits, however, there appears to be no reason for denying plaintiffs means of commencing actions in Federal courts which are generally available in the State courts. See 1 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>supra</em>, at 374&ndash;80; Nordbye, <em>Comments on Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts</em>, 18 F.R.D. 105, 106 (1956); Note, 34 Corn.L.Q. 103 (1948); Note, 13 So.Calif.L.Rev. 361 (1940).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the circumstances of a particular case satisfy the applicable Federal law (first sentence of Rule 4(e), as amended) and the applicable State law (second sentence), the party seeking to make the service may proceed under the Federal or the State law, at his option.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also amended Rule 13(a), and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. The first sentence is amended to assure the effectiveness of service outside the territorial <!-- PDFPage:86 -->limits of the State in all the cases in which any of the rules authorize service beyond those boundaries. Besides the preceding provisions of Rule 4, see Rule 71A(d)(3). In addition, the new second sentence of the subdivision permits effective service within a limited area outside the State in certain special situations, namely, to bring in additional parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim (Rule 13(h)), impleaded parties (Rule 14), and indispensable or conditionally necessary parties to a pending action (Rule 19); and to secure compliance with an order of commitment for civil contempt. In those situations effective service can be made at points not more than 100 miles distant from the courthouse in which the action is commenced, or to which it is assigned or transferred for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The bringing in of parties under the 100-mile provision in the limited situations enumerated is designed to promote the objective of enabling the court to determine entire controversies. In the light of present-day facilities for communication and travel, the territorial range of the service allowed, analogous to that which applies to the service of a subpoena under Rule 45(e)(1), can hardly work hardship on the parties summoned. The provision will be especially useful in metropolitan areas spanning more than one State. Any requirements of subject-matter jurisdiction and venue will still have to be satisfied as to the parties brought in, although these requirements will be eased in some instances when the parties can be regarded as &ldquo;ancillary.&rdquo; See <em>Pennsylvania R.R. v. Erie Avenue Warehouse Co</em>., 5 F.R.Serv.2d 14a.62, Case 2 (3d Cir. 1962); <em>Dery v. Wyer</em>, 265 F.2d 804 (2d Cir. 1959); <em>United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc</em>., 221 F.2d 213 (2d Cir. 1955); <em>Lesnik v. Public Industrials Corp</em>., 144 F.2d 968 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>Vaughn v. Terminal Transp. Co</em>., 162 F.Supp. 647 (E.D.Tenn. 1957); and compare the fifth paragraph of the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 4(e), as amended. The amendment is but a moderate extension of the territorial reach of Federal process and has ample practical justification. See 2 Moore, <em>supra</em>. &sect;4.01[13] (Supp. 1960); 1 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, &sect;184; Note, 51 Nw.U.L.Rev. 354 (1956). <em>But cf</em>. Nordbye, <em>Comments on Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts</em>, 18 F.R.D. 105, 106 (1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">As to the need for enlarging the territorial area in which orders of commitment for civil contempt may be served, see <em>Graber v. Graber</em>, 93 F.Supp. 281 (D.D.C. 1950); <em>Teele Soap Mfg. Co. v. Pine Tree Products Co., Inc</em>., 8 F.Supp. 546 (D.N.H. 1934); <em>Mitchell v. Dexter</em>, 244 Fed. 926 (1st Cir. 1917); <em>in re Graves</em>, 29 Fed. 60 (N.D. Iowa 1886).</p>
<p class="note-body">As to the Court's power to amend subdivisions (e) and (f) as here set forth, see <em>Mississippi Pub. Corp. v. Murphree</em>, 326 U.S. 438, 66 S.Ct. 242, 90 L.Ed. 185 (1946).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)</em>. The continual increase of civil litigation having international elements makes it advisable to consolidate, amplify, and clarify the provisions governing service upon parties in foreign countries. See generally Jones, <em>International Judicial Assistance: Procedural Chaos and a Program for Reform</em>, 62 Yale L.J. 515 (1953); Longley, <em>Serving Process, Subpoenas and Other Documents in Foreign Territory</em>, Proc. A.B.A., Sec. Int'l & Comp. L. 34 (1959); Smit, <em>International Aspects of Federal Civil Procedure</em>, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1031 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">As indicated in the opening lines of new subdivision (i), referring to the provisions of subdivision (e), the authority for effecting foreign service must be found in a statute of the United States or a statute or rule of court of the State in which the district court is held providing in terms or upon proper interpretation for service abroad upon persons not inhabitants of or found within the State. See the Advisory Committee's Note to amended Rule 4(d)(7) and Rule 4(e). For examples of Federal and State statutes expressly authorizing such service, see 8 U.S.C. &sect;1451(b); 35 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;146, 293; Me.Rev.Stat., ch. 22, &sect;70 (Supp. 1961); Minn.Stat.Ann. &sect;303.13 (1947); N.Y.Veh. & Tfc.Law &sect;253. Several decisions have construed statutes to permit service in foreign countries, although the matter is not expressly mentioned in the statutes. See, e.g., <em>Chapman v. Superior Court</em>, 162 Cal.App.2d 421, 328 P.2d 23 (Dist.Ct.App. 1958); <em>Sperry v. Fliegers</em>, 194 Misc. 438, 86 N.Y.S.2d 830 (Sup.Ct. 1949); <em>Ewing v. Thompson</em>, 233 N.C. 564, 65 S.E.2d 17 (1951); <em>Rushing v. Bush</em>, 260 S.W.2d 900 (Tex.Ct.Civ.App. 1953). Federal and State statutes authorizing service on nonresidents in such terms as to warrant the interpretation that service abroad is permissible include 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;77v(a), 78aa, 79y; 28 U.S.C. &sect;1655; 38 U.S.C. &sect;784(a); Ill.Ann.Stat. ch. 110, &sect;&sect;16, 17 (Smith-Hurd 1956); Wis.Stat. &sect;262.06 (1959).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivisions (e) and (i), when authority to make foreign service is found in a Federal statute or statute or rule of court of a State, it is always sufficient to carry out the service in the manner indicated therein. Subdivision (i) introduces considerable further flexibility by permitting the foreign service and return thereof to be carried out in any of a number of other alternative ways that are also declared to be sufficient. Other aspects of foreign service continue to be governed by the other provisions of Rule 4. Thus, for example, subdivision (i) effects no change in the form of the summons, or the issuance of separate or additional summons, or the amendment of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Service of process beyond the territorial limits of the United States may involve difficulties not encountered in the case of domestic service. Service abroad may be considered by a foreign country to require the performance of judicial, and therefore &ldquo;sovereign,&rdquo; acts within its territory, which that country may conceive to be offensive to its policy or contrary to its law. See Jones, <em>supra</em>, at 537. For example, a person not qualified to serve process according to the law of the foreign country may find himself subject to sanctions if he attempts service therein. See Inter-American Judicial Committee, <em>Report on Uniformity of Legislation on International Cooperation in Judicial Procedures</em> 20 (1952). The enforcement of a judgment in the foreign country in which the service was made may be embarrassed or prevented if the service did not comport with the law of that country. See <em>ibid.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">One of the purposes of subdivision (i) is to allow accommodation to the policies and procedures of the foreign country. It is emphasized, however, that the attitudes of foreign countries vary considerably and that the question of recognition of United States judgments abroad is complex. Accordingly, if enforcement is to be sought in the country of service, the foreign law should be examined before a choice is made among the methods of service allowed by subdivision (i).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)(1)</em>. Subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1), permitting service by the method prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service on a person in that country in a civil action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction, provides an alternative that is likely to create least objection in the place of service and also is likely to enhance the possibilities of securing ultimate enforcement of the judgment abroad. See <em>Report on Uniformity of Legislation on International Cooperation in Judicial Procedures, supra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">In certain foreign countries service in aid of litigation pending in other countries can lawfully be accomplished only upon request to the foreign court, which in turn directs the service to be made. In many countries this has long been a customary way of accomplishing the service. See <em>In re Letters Rogatory out of First Civil Court of City of Mexico</em>, 261 Fed. 652 (S.D.N.Y. 1919); <em>Jones, supra</em>, at 543; Comment, 44 Colum.L.Rev. 72 (1944); Note, 58 Yale L.J. 1193 (1949). Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), referring to a letter rogatory, validates this method. A proviso, applicable to this subparagraph and the preceding one, requires, as a safeguard, that the service made shall be reasonably calculated to give actual notice of the proceedings to the party. See <em>Milliken v. Meyer</em>, 311 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 339, 85 L.Ed. 278 (1940).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1), permitting foreign service by personal delivery on individuals and corporations, partnerships, and associations, provides for a manner of service that is not only traditionally preferred, but also is most likely to lead to actual notice. Explicit provision for this manner of service was thought desirable because a number of Federal and <!-- PDFPage:87 -->State statutes permitting foreign service do not specifically provide for service by personal delivery abroad, see e.g., 35 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;146, 293; 46 [App.] U.S.C. &sect;1292; Calif.Ins.Code &sect;1612; N.Y.Veh. & Tfc.Law &sect;253, and it also may be unavailable under the law of the country in which the service is made.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1), permitting service by certain types of mail, affords a manner of service that is inexpensive and expeditious, and requires a minimum of activity within the foreign country. Several statutes specifically provide for service in a foreign country by mail, e.g., Hawaii Rev.Laws &sect;&sect;230&ndash;31, 230&ndash;32 (1955); Minn.Stat.Ann. &sect;303.13 (1947); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Act, &sect;229&ndash;b; N.Y.Veh. & Tfc.Law &sect;253, and it has been sanctioned by the courts even in the absence of statutory provision specifying that form of service. <em>Zurini v. United States</em>, 189 F.2d 722 (8th Cir. 1951); <em>United States v. Cardillo</em>, 135 F.Supp. 798 (W.D.Pa. 1955); <em>Autogiro Co. v. Kay Gyroplanes, Ltd</em>., 55 F.Supp. 919 (D.D.C. 1944). Since the reliability of postal service may vary from country to country, service by mail is proper only when it is addressed to the party to be served and a form of mail requiring a signed receipt is used. An additional safeguard is provided by the requirement that the mailing be attended to be the clerk of the court. See also the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision (i) regarding proof of service by mail.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the applicable law it may be necessary, when the defendant is an infant or incompetent person, to deliver the summons and complaint to a guardian, committee, or similar fiduciary. In such a case it would be advisable to make service under subparagraph (A), (B), or (E).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) adds flexibility by permitting the court by order to tailor the manner of service to fit the necessities of a particular case or the peculiar requirements of the law of the country in which the service is to be made. A similar provision appears in a number of statutes, e.g., 35 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;146, 293; 38 U.S.C. &sect;784(a); 46 [App.] U.S.C. &sect;1292.</p>
<p class="note-body">The next-to-last sentence of paragraph (1) permits service under (C) and (E) to be made by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age or who is designated by court order or by the foreign court. Cf. Rule 45(c); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Act &sect;&sect;233, 235. This alternative increases the possibility that the plaintiff will be able to find a process server who can proceed unimpeded in the foreign country; it also may improve the chances of enforcing the judgment in the country of service. Especially is the alternative valuable when authority for the foreign service is found in a statute or rule of court that limits the group of eligible process servers to designated officials or special appointees who, because directly connected with another &ldquo;sovereign,&rdquo; may be particularly offensive to the foreign country. See generally Smit, <em>supra</em>, at 1040&ndash;41. When recourse is had to subparagraph (A) or (B) the identity of the process server always will be determined by the law of the foreign country in which the service is made.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of paragraph (1) sets forth an alternative manner for the issuance and transmission of the summons for service. After obtaining the summons from the clerk, the plaintiff must ascertain the best manner of delivering the summons and complaint to the person, court, or officer who will make the service. Thus the clerk is not burdened with the task of determining who is permitted to serve process under the law of a particular country or the appropriate governmental or nongovernmental channel for forwarding a letter rogatory. Under (D), however, the papers must always be posted by the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)(2)</em>. When service is made in a foreign country, paragraph (2) permits methods for proof of service in addition to those prescribed by subdivision (g). Proof of service in accordance with the law of the foreign country is permitted because foreign process servers, unaccustomed to the form or the requirement of return of service prevalent in the United States, have on occasion been unwilling to execute the affidavit required by Rule 4(g). See Jones, <em>supra</em>, at 537; Longley, <em>supra</em>, at 35. As a corollary of the alternate manner of service in subdivision (i)(1)(E), proof of service as directed by order of the court is permitted. The special provision for proof of service by mail is intended as an additional safeguard when that method is used. On the type of evidence of delivery that may be satisfactory to a court in lieu of a signed receipt, see <em>Aero Associates, Inc. v. La Metropolitana</em>, 183 F.Supp. 357 (S.D.N.Y. 1960).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The wording of Rule 4(f) is changed to accord with the amendment of Rule 13(h) referring to Rule 19 as amended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1980 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This is a technical amendment to conform this subdivision with the amendment of subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The purpose of this amendment is to authorize service of process to be made by any person who is authorized to make service in actions in the courts of general jurisdiction of the state in which the district court is held or in which service is made.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is a troublesome ambiguity in Rule 4. Rule 4(c) directs that all process is to be served by the marshal, by his deputy, or by a person specially appointed by the court. But Rule 4(d)(7) authorizes service in certain cases &ldquo;in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the district court is held. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; And Rule 4(e), which authorizes service beyond the state and service in <em>quasi in rem</em> cases when state law permits such service, directs that &ldquo;service may be made .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the [state] statute or rule.&rdquo; State statutes and rules of the kind referred to in Rule 4(d)(7) and Rule 4(e) commonly designate the persons who are to make the service provided for, <em>e.g</em>., a sheriff or a plaintiff. When that is so, may the persons so designated by state law make service, or is service in all cases to be made by a marshal or by one specially appointed under present Rule 4(c)? The commentators have noted the ambiguity and have suggested the desirability of an amendment. See 2 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;4.08 (1974); Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil</em> &sect;1092 (1969). And the ambiguity has given rise to unfortunate results. See <em>United States for the use of Tanos v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co</em>., 361 F. 2d 838 (5th Cir. 1966); <em>Veeck v. Commodity Enterprises, Inc</em>., 487 F. 2d 423 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>
<p class="note-body">The ambiguity can be resolved by specific amendments to Rules 4(d)(7) and 4(e), but the Committee is of the view that there is no reason why Rule 4(c) should not generally authorize service of process in all cases by anyone authorized to make service in the courts of general jurisdiction of the state in which the district court is held or in which service is made. The marshal continues to be the obvious, always effective officer for service of process.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">128 Congressional Record H9848, Dec. 15, 1982</h4>
<p class="note-body">Mr. EDWARDS of California. Mr. Speaker, in July Mr. <cap-smallcap>McClory</cap-smallcap> and I brought before the House a bill to delay the effective date of proposed changes in rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, dealing with service of process. The Congress enacted that legislation and delayed the effective date so that we could cure certain problems in the proposed amendments to rule 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since that time, Mr. <cap-smallcap>McClory</cap-smallcap> and I introduced a bill, H.R. 7154, that cures those problems. It was drafted in consultation with representatives of the Department of Justice, the Judicial Conference of the United States, and others.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Justice and the Judicial Conference have endorsed the bill and have urged its prompt enactment. Indeed, the Department of Justice has indicated that the changes occasioned by the bill <!-- PDFPage:88 -->will facilitate its collection of debts owned to the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have a letter from the Office of Legislative Affairs of the Department of Justice supporting the bill that I will submit for the <cap-smallcap>Record</cap-smallcap>. Also, I am submitting for the <cap-smallcap>Record</cap-smallcap> a section-by-section analysis of the bill.</p>
<p class="note-body">H.R. 7154 makes much needed changes in rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and is supported by all interested parties. I urge my colleagues to support it.</p>

<p class="presidential-signature"><em>Washington, D.C., December 10, 1982.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Hon. <cap-smallcap>Peter W. Rodino</cap-smallcap>, Jr.,</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2"><em>Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Dear Mr. Chairman</cap-smallcap>: This is to proffer the views of the Department of Justice on H.R. 7154, the proposed Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Amendments Act of 1982. While the agenda is extremely tight and we appreciate that fact, we do reiterate that this Department strongly endorses the enactment of H.R. 7154. We would greatly appreciate your watching for any possible way to enact this legislation expeditiously.</p>
<p class="note-body">H.R. 7154 would amend Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to relieve effectively the United States Marshals Service of the duty of routinely serving summonses and complaints for private parties in civil actions and would thus achieve a goal this Department has long sought. Experience has shown that the Marshals Service's increasing workload and limited budget require such major relief from the burdens imposed by its role as process-server in all civil actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The bill would also amend Rule 4 to permit certain classes of defendants to be served by first class mail with a notice and acknowledgment of receipt form enclosed. We have previously expressed a preference for the service-by-mail provisions of the proposed amendments to Rule 4 which the Supreme Court transmitted to Congress on April 28, 1982.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments proposed by the Supreme Court would permit service by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. We had regarded the Supreme Court proposal as the more efficient because it would not require and affirmative act of signing and mailing on the part of a defendant. Moreover, the Supreme Court proposal would permit the entry of a default judgment if the record contained a returned receipt showing acceptance by the defendant or a returned envelope showing refusal of the process by the defendant and subsequent service and notice by first class mail. However, critics of that system of mail service have argued that certified mail is not an effective method of providing actual notice to defendants of claims against them because signatures may be illegible or may not match the name of the defendant, or because it may be difficult to determine whether mail has been &ldquo;unclaimed&rdquo; or &ldquo;refused,&rdquo; the latter providing the sole basis for a default judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">As you know, in light of these criticisms the Congress enacted Public Law 97&ndash;227 (H.R. 6663) postponing the effective date of the proposed amendments to Rule 4 until October 1, 1983, so as to facilitate further review of the problem. This Department opposed the delay in the effective date, primarily because the Supreme Court's proposed amendments also contained urgently needed provisions designed to relieve the United States Marshals of the burden of serving summonses and complaints in private civil actions. In our view, these necessary relief provisions are readily separable from the issues of service by certified mail and the propriety of default judgment after service by certified mail which the Congress felt warranted additional review.</p>
<p class="note-body">During the floor consideration of H.R. 6663 Congressman Edwards and other proponents of the delayed effective date pledged to expedite the review of the proposed amendments to Rule 4, given the need to provide prompt relief for the Marshals Service in the service of process area. In this spirit Judiciary Committee staff consulted with representatives of this Department, the Judicial Conference, and others who had voiced concern about the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="note-body">H.R. 7154 is the product of those consultations and accommodated the concerns of the Department in a very workable and acceptable manner.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, we are satisfied that the provisions of H.R. 7154 merit the support of all three branches of the Federal Government and everyone else who has a stake in the fair and efficient service of process in civil actions. We urge prompt consideration of H.R. 7154 by the Committee.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_1_target" name="Rule_4_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">Robert A. McConnell,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="presidential-signature"><em>Assistant Attorney General.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_1_target" name="Rule_4_1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition to amending Rule 4, we have previously recommended: (a) amendments to 28 U.S.C. &sect;569(b) redefining the Marshals traditional role by eliminating the statutory requirement that they serve subpoenas, as well as summonses and complaints, and; (b) amendments to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1921 changing the manner and level in which marshal fees are charged for serving private civil process. These legislative changes are embodied in Section 10 of S. 2567 and the Department's proposed fiscal year 1983 Appropriations Authorization bill. If, in the Committee's judgment, efforts to incorporate these suggested amendments in H.R. 7154 would in any way impede consideration of the bill during the few remaining legislative days in the 97th Congress, we would urge that they be separately considered early in the 98th Congress.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">H.R. 7154&mdash;Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Amendments Act of 1982</h4>
I74background<p class="note-body">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set forth the procedures to be followed in civil actions and proceedings in United States district courts. These rules are usually amended by a process established by 28 U.S.C. 2072, often referred to as the &ldquo;Rules Enabling Act&rdquo;. The Rules Enabling Act provides that the Supreme Court can propose new rules of &ldquo;practice and procedure&rdquo; and amendments to existing rules by transmitting them to Congress after the start of a regular session but not later than May 1. The rules and amendments so proposed take effect 90 days after transmittal unless legislation to the contrary is enacted.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_1_target" name="Rule_4_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">On April 28, 1982, the Supreme Court transmitted to Congress several proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (which govern criminal cases and proceedings in Federal courts), and the Rules and Forms Governing Proceedings in the United States District Courts under sections 2254 and 2255 of Title 28, United States Code (which govern habeas corpus proceedings). These amendments were to have taken effect on August 1, 1982.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were intended primarily to relieve United States marshals of the burden of serving summonses and complaints in private civil actions. Appendix II, at 7 (Report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure), 16 (Advisory Committee Note). The Committee received numerous complaints that the changes not only failed to achieve that goal, but that in the process the changes saddled litigators with flawed mail service, deprived litigants of the use of effective local procedures for service, and created a time limit for service replete with ambiguities that could only be resolved by costly litigation. See House Report No. 97&ndash;662, at 2&ndash;4 (1982).</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to consider these criticisms, Congress enacted Public Law 97&ndash;227, postponing the effective date of the proposed amendments to Rule 4 until October 1, 1983.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_2_target" name="Rule_4_2">2</a></sup> Accordingly, in order to help shape the policy behind, and the form of, the proposed amendments, Congress must enact legislation before October 1, 1983.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_3_target" name="Rule_4_3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">With that deadline and purpose in mind, consultations were held with representatives of the Judicial <!-- PDFPage:89 -->Conference, the Department of Justice, and others who had voiced concern about the proposed amendments. H.R. 7154 is the product of those consultations. The bill seeks to effectuate the policy of relieving the Marshals Service of the duty of routinely serving summonses and complaints. It provides a system of service by mail modeled upon a system found to be effective in California, and finally, it makes appropriate stylistic, grammatical, and other changes in Rule 4.</p>

<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>1. Current Rule 4</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relates to the issuance and service of process. Subsection (c) authorizes service of process by personnel of the Marshals Service, by a person specially appointed by the Court, or &ldquo;by a person authorized to serve process in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of the state in which the district court is held or in which service is made.&rdquo; Subsection (d) describes how a summons and complaint must be served and designates those persons who must be served in cases involving specified categories of defendants. Mail service is not directly authorized. Subsection (d)(7), however, authorizes service under the law of the state in which the district court sits upon defendants described in subsections (d)(1) (certain individuals) and (d)(3) (organizations). Thus, if state law authorizes service by mail of a summons and complaint upon an individual or organization described in subsections (d)(1) or (3), then subsection (d)(7) authorizes service by mail for United States district courts in that state.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_4_target" name="Rule_4_4">4</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>2. Reducing the role of marshals</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court's proposed modifications of Rule 4 were designed to alleviate the burden on the Marshals Service of serving summonses and complaints in private civil actions. Appendix II, at 7 (Report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure), 16 (Advisory Committee Note). While the Committee received no complaints about the goal of reducing the role of the Marshals Service, the Court's proposals simply failed to achieve that goal. See House Report No. 97&ndash;662, at 2&ndash;3 (1982).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Court's proposed Rule 4(c)(2)(B) required the Marshals Service to serve summonses and complaints &ldquo;pursuant to any statutory provision expressly providing for service by a United States Marshal or his deputy.&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_4_5_target" name="Rule_4_5">5</a></sup> One such statutory provision is 28 U.S.C. 569(b), which compels marshals to &ldquo;execute <em>all</em> lawful writs, process and orders issued under authority of the United States, <em>including those of the courts</em> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; (emphasis added). Thus, any party could have invoked 28 U.S.C. 569(b) to utilize a marshal for service of a summons and complaint, thereby thwarting the intent of the new subsection to limit the use of marshals. The Justice Department acknowledges that the proposed subsection did not accomplish its objectives.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_6_target" name="Rule_4_6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">Had 28 U.S.C. 569(b) been inconsistent with proposed Rule 4(c)(2)(B), the latter would have nullified the former under 28 U.S.C. 2072, which provides that &ldquo;All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.&rdquo; Since proposed Rule 4(c)(2)(B) specifically referred to statutes such as 28 U.S.C. 569(b), however, the new subsection did not conflict with 28 U.S.C. 569(b) and did not, therefore, supersede it.</p>
<p class="note-body">H.R. 7154 cures this problem and achieves the desired reduction in the role of the Marshals Service by authorizing marshals to serve summonses and complaints &ldquo;on behalf of the United States&rdquo;. By so doing, H.R. 7154 eliminates the loophole in the Court's proposed language and still provides for service by marshals on behalf of the Government.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_7_target" name="Rule_4_7">7</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>3. Mail service</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court's proposed subsection (d)(7) and (8) authorized, as an alternative to personal service, mail service of summonses and complaints on individuals and organizations described in subsection (d)(1) and (3), but only through registered or certified mail, restricted delivery. Critics of that system of mail service argued that registered and certified mail were not necessarily effective methods of providing actual notice to defendants of claims against them. This was so, they argued, because signatures may be illegible or may not match the name of the defendant, or because it may be difficult to determine whether mail has been &ldquo;unclaimed&rdquo; or &ldquo;refused&rdquo;, the latter apparently providing the sole basis for a default judgment.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_8_target" name="Rule_4_8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">H.R. 7154 provides for a system of service by mail similar to the system now used in California. See Cal. Civ. Pro. &sect;415.30 (West 1973). Service would be by ordinary mail with a notice and acknowledgment of receipt form enclosed. If the defendant returns the acknowledgment form to the sender within 20 days of mailing, the sender files the return and service is complete. If the acknowledgment is not returned within 20 days of mailing, then service must be effected through some other means provided for in the Rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">This system of mail service avoids the notice problems created by the registered and certified mail procedures proposed by the Supreme Court. If the proper person receives the notice and returns the acknowledgment, service is complete. If the proper person does not receive the mailed form, or if the proper person receives the notice but fails to return the acknowledgment form, another method of service authorized by law is required.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_9_target" name="Rule_4_9">9</a></sup> In either instance, however, the defendant will receive actual notice of the claim. In order to encourage defendants to return the acknowledgment form, the court can order a defendant who does not return it to pay the costs of service unless the defendant can show good cause for the failure to return it.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>4. The local option</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Court's proposed amendments to Rule 4 deleted the provision in current subsection (d)(7) that authorizes service of a summons and complaint upon individuals and organizations &ldquo;in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the district court is held for the service of summons or other like process upon any such defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state.&rdquo; The Committee received a variety of complaints about the deletion of this provision. Those in favor of preserving the local option saw no reason to forego systems of service that had been successful in achieving effective notice.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_10_target" name="Rule_4_10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">H.R. 7154 carries forward the policy of the current rule and permits a party to serve a summons and complaint upon individuals and organizations described in Rule 4(d)(1) and (3) in accordance with the law of the state in which the district court sits. Thus, the bill authorizes four methods of serving a summons and complaint on such defendants: (1) service by a nonparty adult (Rule 4(c)(2)(A)); (2) service by personnel of the Marshals Service, if the party qualifies, such as because the party is proceeding in forma pauperis (Rule 4(c)(2)(B)); (3) service in any manner authorized by the law of the state in which the district court is held (Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(i)); or (4) service by regular mail with a notice and acknowledgment of receipt form enclosed (Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii)).<sup><a href="#Rule_4_11_target" name="Rule_4_11">11</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>5. Time limits</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4 does not currently provide a time limit within which service must be completed. Primarily because United States marshals currently effect service of process, no time restriction has been deemed necessary. Appendix II, at 18 (Advisory Committee Note). Along with the proposed changes to subdivisions (c) and (d) to reduce the role of the Marshals Service, however, came new subdivision (j), requiring that service of a summons and complaint be made within 120 days of the filing of the complaint. If service were not accomplished within that time, proposed subdivision (j) required that the action &ldquo;be dismissed as to that defendant without prejudice upon motion or upon the court's own initia<!-- PDFPage:90 -->tive&rdquo;. Service by mail was deemed made for purposes of subdivision (j) &ldquo;as of the date on which the process was accepted, refused, or returned as unclaimed&rdquo;.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_12_target" name="Rule_4_12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">H.R. 7154 adopts a policy of limiting the time to effect service. It provides that if a summons and complaint have not been served within 120 days of the filing of the complaint and the plaintiff fails to show &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; for not completing service within that time, then the court must dismiss the action as to the unserved defendant. H.R. 7154 ensures that a plaintiff will be notified of an attempt to dismiss the action. If dismissal for failure to serve is raised by the court upon its own motion, the legislation requires that the court provide notice to the plaintiff. If dismissal is sought by someone else, Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the motion be served upon the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="note-body">Like proposed subsection (j), H.R. 7154 provides that a dismissal for failure to serve within 120 days shall be &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;. Proposed subsection (j) was criticized by some for ambiguity because, it was argued, neither the text of subsection (j) nor the Advisory Committee Note indicated whether a dismissal without prejudice would toll a statute of limitation. <em>See</em> House Report 97&ndash;662, at 3&ndash;4 (1982). The problem would arise when a plaintiff files the complaint within the applicable statute of limitation period but does not effect service within 120 days. If the statute of limitation period expires during that period, and if the plaintiff's action is dismissed &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;, can the plaintiff refile the complaint and maintain the action? The answer depends upon how the statute of limitation is tolled.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_13_target" name="Rule_4_13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">If the law provides that the statute of limitation is tolled by filing and service of the complaint, then a dismissal under H.R. 7154 for failure to serve within the 120 days would, by the terms of the law controlling the tolling, bar the plaintiff from later maintaining the cause of action.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_14_target" name="Rule_4_14">14</a></sup> If the law provides that the statute of limitation is tolled by filing alone, then the status of the plaintiff's cause of action turns upon the plaintiff's diligence. If the plaintiff has not been diligent, the court will dismiss the complaint for failure to serve within 120 days, and the plaintiff will be barred from later maintaining the cause of action because the statute of limitation has run. A dismissal without prejudice does not confer upon the plaintiff any rights that the plaintiff does not otherwise possess and leaves a plaintiff whose action has been dismissed in the same position as if the action had never been filed.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_15_target" name="Rule_4_15">15</a></sup> If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to effect service, then the plaintiff can move under Rule 6(b) to enlarge the time within which to serve or can oppose dismissal for failure to serve. A court would undoubtedly permit such a plaintiff additional time within which to effect service. Thus, a diligent plaintiff can preserve the cause of action. This result is consistent with the policy behind the time limit for service and with statutes of limitation, both of which are designed to encourage prompt movement of civil actions in the federal courts.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>6. Conforming and clarifying subsections (d)(4) and (5)</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Current subsections (d)(4) and (5) prescribe which persons must be served in cases where an action is brought against the United States or an officer or agency of the United States. Under subsection (d)(4), where the United States is the named defendant, service must be made as follows: (1) personal service upon the United States attorney, an assistant United States attorney, or a designated clerical employee of the United States attorney in the district in which the action is brought; (2) registered or certified mail service to the Attorney General of the United States in Washington, D.C.; and (3) registered or certified mail service to the appropriate officer or agency if the action attacks an order of that officer or agency but does not name the officer or agency as a defendant. Under subsection (d)(5), where an officer or agency of the United States is named as a defendant, service must be made as in subsection (d)(4), except that personal service upon the officer or agency involved is required.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_16_target" name="Rule_4_16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">The time limit for effecting service in H.R. 7154 would present significant difficulty to a plaintiff who has to arrange for personal service upon an officer or agency that may be thousands of miles away. There is little reason to require different types of service when the officer or agency is named as a party, and H.R. 7154 therefore conforms the manner of service under subsection (d)(5) to the manner of service under subsection (d)(4).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Section-by-Section Analysis</h4>
I74section 1<p class="note-body">Section 1 provides that the short title of the bill is the &ldquo;Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Amendments Act of 1982&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">section 2</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of the bill consists of 7 numbered paragraphs, each amending a different part of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) deletes the requirement in present Rule 4(a) that a summons be delivered for service to the marshal or other person authorized to serve it. As amended by the legislation, Rule 4(a) provides that the summons be delivered to &ldquo;the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney, who shall be responsible for prompt service of the summons and complaint&rdquo;. This change effectuates the policy proposed by the Supreme Court. See Appendix II, at &mdash; (Advisory Committee Note).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) amends current Rule 4(c), which deals with the service of process. New Rule 4(c)(1) requires that all process, other than a subpoena or a summons and complaint, be served by the Marshals Service or by a person especially appointed for that purpose. Thus, the Marshals Service or persons specially appointed will continue to serve all process other than subpoenas and summonses and complaints, a policy identical to that proposed by the Supreme Court. See Appendix II, at 8 (Report of the Judicial Conference Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure). The service of subpoenas is governed by Rule 45,<sup><a href="#Rule_4_17_target" name="Rule_4_17">17</a></sup> and the service of summonses and complaints is governed by new Rule 4(c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 4(c)(2)(A) sets forth the general rule that summonses and complaints shall be served by someone who is at least 18 years old and not a party to the action or proceeding. This is consistent with the Court's proposal. Appendix II, at 16 (Advisory Committee Note). Subparagraphs (B) and (C) of new Rule 4(c)(2) set forth exceptions to this general rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (B) sets forth 3 exceptions to the general rule. First, subparagraph (B)(i) requires the Marshals Service (or someone specially appointed by the court) to serve summonses and complaints on behalf of a party proceeding in forma pauperis or a seaman authorized to proceed under 28 U.S.C. 1916. This is identical to the Supreme Court's proposal. <em>See</em> Appendix II, at 3 (text of proposed rule), 16 (Advisory Committee Note). Second, subparagraph (B)(ii) requires the Marshals Service (or someone specially appointed by the court) to serve a summons and complaint when the court orders the marshals to do so in order properly to effect service in that particular action.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_18_target" name="Rule_4_18">18</a></sup> This, except for nonsubstantive changes in phrasing, is identical to the Supreme Court's proposal. See Appendix II, at 3 (text of proposed rule), 16 (Advisory Committee Note).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (C) of new Rule 4(c)(2) provides 2 exceptions to the general rule of service by a nonparty adult. These exceptions apply only when the summons and complaint is to be served upon persons described in Rule 4(d)(1) (certain individuals) or Rule 4(d)(3) (organizations).<sup><a href="#Rule_4_19_target" name="Rule_4_19">19</a></sup> First, subparagraph (C)(i) permits service of a summons and complaint in a manner authorized by the law of the state in which the court sits. This restates the option to follow local law currently found in Rule 4(d)(7) and would authorize service by mail if the state law so allowed. The method of mail service in that instance would, of course, be the method permitted by state law.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:91 --><p class="note-body">Second, subparagraph (C)(ii) permits service of a summons and complaint by regular mail. The sender must send to the defendant, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the summons and complaint, together with 2 copies of a notice and acknowledgment of receipt of summons and complaint form and a postage prepaid return envelope addressed to the sender. If a copy of the notice and acknowledgment form is not received by the sender within 20 days after the date of mailing, then service must be made under Rule 4(c)(2)(A) or (B) (i.e., by a nonparty adult or, if the person qualifies,<sup><a href="#Rule_4_20_target" name="Rule_4_20">20</a></sup> by personnel of the Marshals Service or a person specially appointed by the court) in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(d)(1) or (3) (i.e., personal or substituted service).</p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 4(c)(2)(D) permits a court to penalize a person who avoids service by mail. It authorizes the court to order a person who does not return the notice and acknowledgment form within 20 days after mailing to pay the costs of service, unless that person can show good cause for failing to return the form. The purpose of this provision is to encourage the prompt return of the form so that the action can move forward without unnecessary delay. Fairness requires that a person who causes another additional and unnecessary expense in effecting service ought to reimburse the party who was forced to bear the additional expense.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (E) of rule 4(c)(2) requires that the notice and acknowledgment form described in new Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) be executed under oath or affirmation. This provision tracks the language of 28 U.S.C. 1746, which permits the use of unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury whenever an oath or affirmation is required. Statements made under penalty of perjury are subject to 18 U.S,C. 1621(2), which provides felony penalties for someone who &ldquo;willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true&rdquo;. The requirement that the form be executed under oath or affirmation is intended to encourage truthful submissions to the court, as the information contained in the form is important to the parties.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_21_target" name="Rule_4_21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 4(c)(3) authorizes the court freely to make special appointments to serve summonses and complaints under Rule 4(c)(2)(B) and all other process under Rule 4(c)(1). This carries forward the policy of present Rule 4(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) of section 2 of the bill makes a non-substantive change in the caption of Rule 4(d) in order to reflect more accurately the provisions of Rule 4(d). Paragraph (3) also deletes a provision on service of a summons and complaint pursuant to state law. This provision is redundant in view of new Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(i).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (4) of section 2 of the bill conforms Rule 4(d)(5) to present Rule 4(d)(4). Rule 4(d)(5) is amended to provide that service upon a named defendant agency or officer of the United States shall be made by &ldquo;sending&rdquo; a copy of the summons and complaint &ldquo;by registered or certified mail&rdquo; to the defendant.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_22_target" name="Rule_4_22">22</a></sup> Rule 4(d)(5) currently provides for service by &ldquo;delivering&rdquo; the copies to the defendant, but 28 U.S.C. 1391(e) authorizes delivery upon a defendant agency or officer outside of the district in which the action is brought by means of certified mail. Hence, the change is not a marked departure from current practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (5) of section 2 of the bill amends the caption of Rule 4(e) in order to describe subdivision (e) more accurately.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (6) of section 2 of the bill amends Rule 4(g), which deals with return of service. Present rule 4(g) is not changed except to provide that, if service is made pursuant to the new system of mail service (Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii)), the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney must file with the court the signed acknowledgment form returned by the person served.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (7) of section 2 of the bill adds new subsection (j) to provide a time limitation for the service of a summons and complaint. New Rule 4(j) retains the Supreme Court's requirement that a summons and complaint be served within 120 days of the filing of the complaint. See Appendix II, at 18 (Advisory Committee Note).<sup><a href="#Rule_4_23_target" name="Rule_4_23">23</a></sup> The plaintiff must be notified of an effort or intention to dismiss the action. This notification is mandated by subsection (j) if the dismissal is being raised on the court's own initiative and will be provided pursuant to Rule 5 (which requires service of motions upon the adverse party) if the dismissal is sought by someone else.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_24_target" name="Rule_4_24">24</a></sup> The plaintiff may move under Rule 6(b) to enlarge the time period. See Appendix II, at 1d. (Advisory Committee Note). If service is not made within the time period or enlarged time period, however, and if the plaintiff fails to show &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; for not completing service, then the court must dismiss the action as to the unserved defendant. The dismissal is &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; means that the dismissal does not constitute an adjudication of the merits of the complaint. A dismissal &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; leaves a plaintiff whose action has been dismissed in the position in which that person would have been if the action had never been filed.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">section 3</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 3 of the bill amends the Appendix of Forms at the end of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by adding a new form 18A, &ldquo;Notice and Acknowledgment for Service by Mail&rdquo;. This new form is required by new Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii), which requires that the notice and acknowledgment form used with service by regular mail conform substantially to Form 18A.</p>
<p class="note-body">Form 18A as set forth in section 3 of the bill is modeled upon a form used in California.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_25_target" name="Rule_4_25">25</a></sup> It contains 2 parts. The first part is a notice to the person being served that tells that person that the enclosed summons and complaint is being served pursuant to Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii); advises that person to sign and date the acknowledgment form and indicate the authority to receive service if the person served is not the party to the action (e.g., the person served is an officer of the organization being served); and warns that failure to return the form to the sender within 20 days may result in the court ordering the party being served to pay the expenses involved in effecting service. The notice also warns that if the complaint is not responded to within 20 days, a default judgment can be entered against the party being served. The notice is dated under penalty of perjury by the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney.<sup><a href="#Rule_4_26_target" name="Rule_4_26">26</a></sup></p>
<p class="note-body">The second part of the form contains the acknowledgment of receipt of the summons and complaint. The person served must declare on this part of the form, under penalty of perjury, the date and place of service and the person's authority to receive service.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">section 4</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 4 of the bill provides that the changes in Rule 4 made by H.R. 7154 will take effect 45 days after enactment, thereby giving the bench and bar, as well as other interested persons and organizations (such as the Marshals Service), an opportunity to prepare to implement the changes made by the legislation. The delayed effective date means that service of process issued before the effective date will be made in accordance with current Rule 4. Accordingly, all process in the hands of the Marshals Service prior to the effective date will be served by the Marshals Service under the present rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">section 5</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 5 of the bill provides that the amendments to Rule 4 proposed by the Supreme Court (whose effective date was postponed by Public Law 97&ndash;227) shall not take effect. This is necessary because under Public Law 97&ndash;227 the proposed amendments will take effect on October 1, 1983.</p>

<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_1_target" name="Rule_4_1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;The drafting of the rules and amendments is actually done by a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States. In the case of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the initial draft is prepared by the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. The Advisory Committee's draft is then reviewed by the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, which must give its approval to the draft. Any draft approved by that committee is forwarded to <!-- PDFPage:92 -->the Judicial Conference. If the Judicial Conference approves the draft, it forwards the draft to the Supreme Court. The Judicial Conference's role in the rule-making process is defined by 28 U.S.C. 331.</p>

<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_4_target" name="Rule_4_4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Where service of a summons is to be made upon a party who is neither an inhabitant of, nor found within, the state where the district court sits, subsection (e) authorizes service under a state statute or rule of court that provides for service upon such a party. This would authorize mail service if the state statute or rule of court provided for service by mail.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_5_target" name="Rule_4_5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;The Court's proposal authorized service by the Marshals Service in other situations. This authority, however, was not seen as thwarting the underlying policy of limiting the use of marshals. <em>See</em> Appendix II, at 16, 17 (Advisory Committee Note).</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_6_target" name="Rule_4_6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Appendix I, at 2 (letter of Assistant Attorney General Robert A. McConnell).</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_7_target" name="Rule_4_7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;The provisions of H.R. 7154 conflict with 28 U.S.C. 569(b) because the latter is a broader command to marshals to serve all federal court process. As a later statutory enactment, however, H.R. 7154 supersedes 28 U.S.C. 569(b), thereby achieving the goal of reducing the role of marshals.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_8_target" name="Rule_4_8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Proposed Rule 4(d)(8) provided that &ldquo;Service .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall not be the basis for the entry of a default or a judgment by default unless the record contains a return receipt showing acceptance by the defendant or a returned envelope showing refusal of the process by the defendant.&rdquo; This provision reflects a desire to preclude default judgments on unclaimed mail. See Appendix II, at 7 (Report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure).</p>
<p class="note-body-small">The interpretation of Rule 4(d)(8) to require a refusal of delivery in order to have a basis for a default judgment, while undoubtedly the interpretation intended and the interpretation that reaches the fairest result, may not be the only possible interpretation. Since a default judgment can be entered for defendant's failure to respond to the complaint once defendant has been served and the time to answer the complaint has run, it can be argued that a default judgment can be obtained where the mail was unclaimed because proposed subsection (j), which authorized dismissal of a complaint not served within 120 days, provided that mail service would be deemed made &ldquo;on the date on which the process was accepted, refused, or <em>returned as unclaimed</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added).</p>

<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_10_target" name="Rule_4_10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Proponents of the California system of mail service, in particular, saw no reason to supplant California's proven method of mail service with a certified mail service that they believed likely to result in default judgments without actual notice to defendants. See House Report No. 97&ndash;662, at 3 (1982).</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_11_target" name="Rule_4_11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;The parties may, of course, stipulate to service, as is frequently done now.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_12_target" name="Rule_4_12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;While return of the letter as unclaimed was deemed service for the purpose of determining whether the plaintiff's action could be dismissed, return of the letter as unclaimed was not service for the purpose of entry of a default judgment against the defendant. See note 8 supra.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_13_target" name="Rule_4_13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;The law governing the tolling of a statute of limitation depends upon the type of civil action involved. In adversity action, state law governs tolling. <em>Walker v. Armco Steel Corp</em>., 446 U.S. 740 (1980). In <em>Walker</em>, plaintiff had filed his complaint and thereby commenced the action under Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure within the statutory period. He did not, however, serve the summons and complaint until after the statutory period had run. The Court held that state law (which required both filing and service within the statutory period) governed, barring plaintiff's action.</p>
<p class="note-body-small">In the federal question action, the courts of appeals have generally held that Rule 3 governs, so that the filing of the complaint tolls a statute of limitation. <em>United States v. Wahl</em>, 538 F.2d 285 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Windbrooke Dev. Co. v. Environmental Enterprises Inc. of Fla</em>., 524 F.2d 461 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Metropolitan Paving Co. v.

The continued validity of this line of cases, however, must be questioned in light of the <em>Walker</em> case, even though the Court in that case expressly reserved judgment about federal question actions, <em>see Walker v. Armco Steel Corp</em>., 446 U.S. 741, 751 n.11 (1980).</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_14_target" name="Rule_4_14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;The same result obtains even if service occurs within the 120 day period, if the service occurs after the statute of limitation has run.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_15_target" name="Rule_4_15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;See p. 19 infra.</p>

<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_17_target" name="Rule_4_17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;Rule 45(c) provides that &ldquo;A subpoena may be served by the marshal, by his deputy, or by any other person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_18_target" name="Rule_4_18">18</a></sup>&nbsp;Some litigators have voiced concern that there may be situations in which personal service by someone other than a member of the Marshals Service may present a risk of injury to the person attempting to make the service. For example, a hostile defendant may have a history of injuring persons attempting to serve process. Federal judges undoubtedly will consider the risk of harm to private persons who would be making personal service when deciding whether to order the Marshals Service to make service under Rule 4(c)(2)(B)(iii).</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_19_target" name="Rule_4_19">19</a></sup>&nbsp;The methods of service authorized by Rule 4(c)(2)(C) may be invoked by any person seeking to effect service. Thus, a nonparty adult who receives the summons and complaint for service under Rule 4(c)(1) may serve them personally or by mail in the manner authorized by Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii). Similarly, the Marshals Service may utilize the mail service authorized by Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) when serving a summons and complaint under Rule 4(c)(2)(B)(i)(iii). When serving a summons and complaint under Rule 4(c)(2)(B)(ii), however, the Marshals Service must serve in the manner set forth in the court's order. If no particular manner of service is specified, then the Marshals Service may utilize Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii). It would not seem to be appropriate, however, for the Marshals Service to utilize Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) in a situation where a previous attempt to serve by mail failed. Thus, it would not seem to be appropriate for the Marshals Service to attempt service by regular mail when serving a summons and complaint on behalf of a plaintiff who is proceeding in forma pauperis if that plaintiff previously attempted unsuccessfully to serve the defendant by mail.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_20_target" name="Rule_4_20">20</a></sup>&nbsp;To obtain service by personnel of the Marshals Service or someone specially appointed by the court, a plaintiff who has unsuccessfully attempted mail service under Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) must meet the conditions of Rule 4(c)(2)(B)&mdash;for example, the plaintiff must be proceeding <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_21_target" name="Rule_4_21">21</a></sup>&nbsp;For example, the sender must state the date of mailing on the form. If the form is not returned to the sender within 20 days of that date, then the plaintiff must serve the defendant in another manner and the defendant may be liable for the costs of such service. Thus, a defendant would suffer the consequences of a misstatement about the date of mailing.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_22_target" name="Rule_4_22">22</a></sup>&nbsp;See p. 12 supra.</p>
<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_23_target" name="Rule_4_23">23</a></sup>&nbsp;The 120 day period begins to run upon the filing of each complaint.

<p class="note-body-small"><sup><a href="#Rule_4_24_target" name="Rule_4_24">24</a></sup>&nbsp;The person who may move to dismiss can be the putative defendant (i.e., the person named as defendant in the complaint filed with the court) or, in multi-party actions, another party to the action.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Purposes of Revision. The general purpose of this revision is to facilitate the service of the summons and complaint. The revised rule explicitly authorizes a means for service of the summons and complaint on any defendant. While the methods of service so authorized always provide appropriate notice to persons against whom claims are made, effective service under this rule does not assure that personal jurisdiction has been established over the defendant served.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the revised rule authorizes the use of any means of service provided by the law not only of the forum state, but also of the state in which a defendant <!-- PDFPage:93 -->is served, unless the defendant is a minor or incompetent.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, the revised rule clarifies and enhances the cost-saving practice of securing the assent of the defendant to dispense with actual service of the summons and complaint. This practice was introduced to the rule in 1983 by an act of Congress authorizing &ldquo;service-by-mail,&rdquo; a procedure that effects economic service with cooperation of the defendant. Defendants that magnify costs of service by requiring expensive service not necessary to achieve full notice of an action brought against them are required to bear the wasteful costs. This provision is made available in actions against defendants who cannot be served in the districts in which the actions are brought.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, the revision reduces the hazard of commencing an action against the United States or its officers, agencies, and corporations. A party failing to effect service on all the offices of the United States as required by the rule is assured adequate time to cure defects in service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, the revision calls attention to the important effect of the Hague Convention and other treaties bearing on service of documents in foreign countries and favors the use of internationally agreed means of service. In some respects, these treaties have facilitated service in foreign countries but are not fully known to the bar.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the revised rule extends the reach of federal courts to impose jurisdiction over the person of all defendants against whom federal law claims are made and who can be constitutionally subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. The present territorial limits on the effectiveness of service to subject a defendant to the jurisdiction of the court over the defendant's person are retained for all actions in which there is a state in which personal jurisdiction can be asserted consistently with state law and the Fourteenth Amendment. A new provision enables district courts to exercise jurisdiction, if permissible under the Constitution and not precluded by statute, when a federal claim is made against a defendant not subject to the jurisdiction of any single state.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised rule is reorganized to make its provisions more accessible to those not familiar with all of them. Additional subdivisions in this rule allow for more captions; several overlaps among subdivisions are eliminated; and several disconnected provisions are removed, to be relocated in a new Rule 4.1.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>The Caption of the Rule</em>. Prior to this revision, Rule 4 was entitled &ldquo;Process&rdquo; and applied to the service of not only the summons but also other process as well, although these are not covered by the revised rule. Service of process in eminent domain proceedings is governed by Rule 71A. Service of a subpoena is governed by Rule 45, and service of papers such as orders, motions, notices, pleadings, and other documents is governed by Rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised rule is entitled &ldquo;Summons&rdquo; and applies only to that form of legal process. Unless service of the summons is waived, a summons must be served whenever a person is joined as a party against whom a claim is made. Those few provisions of the former rule which relate specifically to service of process other than a summons are relocated in Rule 4.1 in order to simplify the text of this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Revised subdivision (a) contains most of the language of the former subdivision (b). The second sentence of the former subdivision (b) has been stricken, so that the federal court summons will be the same in all cases. Few states now employ distinctive requirements of form for a summons and the applicability of such a requirement in federal court can only serve as a trap for an unwary party or attorney. A sentence is added to this subdivision authorizing an amendment of a summons. This sentence replaces the rarely used former subdivision 4(h). <em>See</em> 4A Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;1131 (2d ed. 1987).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Revised subdivision (b) replaces the former subdivision (a). The revised text makes clear that the responsibility for filling in the summons falls on the plaintiff, not the clerk of the court. If there are multiple defendants, the plaintiff may secure issuance of a summons for each defendant, or may serve copies of a single original bearing the names of multiple defendants if the addressee of the summons is effectively identified.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Paragraph (1) of revised subdivision (c) retains language from the former subdivision (d)(1). Paragraph (2) retains language from the former subdivision (a), and adds an appropriate caution regarding the time limit for service set forth in subdivision (m).</p>
<p class="note-body">The 1983 revision of Rule 4 relieved the marshals&rsquo; offices of much of the burden of serving the summons. Subdivision (c) eliminates the requirement for service by the marshal's office in actions in which the party seeking service is the United States. The United States, like other civil litigants, is now permitted to designate any person who is 18 years of age and not a party to serve its summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court remains obligated to appoint a marshal, a deputy, or some other person to effect service of a summons in two classes of cases specified by statute: actions brought <em>in forma pauperis</em> or by a seaman. 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1915, 1916. The court also retains discretion to appoint a process server on motion of a party. If a law enforcement presence appears to be necessary or advisable to keep the peace, the court should appoint a marshal or deputy or other official person to make the service. The Department of Justice may also call upon the Marshals Service to perform services in actions brought by the United States. 28 U.S.C. &sect;651.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This text is new, but is substantially derived from the former subdivisions (c)(2)(C) and (D), added to the rule by Congress in 1983. The aims of the provision are to eliminate the costs of service of a summons on many parties and to foster cooperation among adversaries and counsel. The rule operates to impose upon the defendant those costs that could have been avoided if the defendant had cooperated reasonably in the manner prescribed. This device is useful in dealing with defendants who are furtive, who reside in places not easily reached by process servers, or who are outside the United States and can be served only at substantial and unnecessary expense. Illustratively, there is no useful purpose achieved by requiring a plaintiff to comply with all the formalities of service in a foreign country, including costs of translation, when suing a defendant manufacturer, fluent in English, whose products are widely distributed in the United States. <em>See Bankston v. Toyota Motor Corp</em>., 889 F.2d 172 (8th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="note-body">The former text described this process as service-by-mail. This language misled some plaintiffs into thinking that service could be effected by mail without the affirmative cooperation of the defendant. <em>E.g., Gulley v. Mayo Foundation</em>, 886 F.2d 161 (8th Cir. 1989). It is more accurate to describe the communication sent to the defendant as a request for a waiver of formal service.</p>
<p class="note-body">The request for waiver of service may be sent only to defendants subject to service under subdivision (e), (f), or (h). The United States is not expected to waive service for the reason that its mail receiving facilities are inadequate to assure that the notice is actually received by the correct person in the Department of Justice. The same principle is applied to agencies, corporations, and officers of the United States and to other governments and entities subject to service under subdivision (j). Moreover, there are policy reasons why governmental entities should not be confronted with the potential for bearing costs of service in cases in which they ultimately prevail. Infants or incompetent persons likewise are not called upon to waive service because, due to their presumed inability to understand the request and its consequences, they must generally be served through fiduciaries.</p>
<p class="note-body">It was unclear whether the former rule authorized mailing of a request for &ldquo;acknowledgement of service&rdquo; to defendants outside the forum state. <em>See</em> 1 R. Casad, <em>Jurisdiction in Civil Actions</em> (2d Ed.) 5&ndash;29, 30 (1991) and cases cited. But, as Professor Casad observed, there was <!-- PDFPage:94 -->no reason not to employ this device in an effort to obtain service outside the state, and there are many instances in which it was in fact so used, with respect both to defendants within the United States and to defendants in other countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">The opportunity for waiver has distinct advantages to a foreign defendant. By waiving service, the defendant can reduce the costs that may ultimately be taxed against it if unsuccessful in the lawsuit, including the sometimes substantial expense of translation that may be wholly unnecessary for defendants fluent in English. Moreover, a foreign defendant that waives service is afforded substantially more time to defend against the action than if it had been formally served: under Rule 12, a defendant ordinarily has only 20 days after service in which to file its answer or raise objections by motion, but by signing a waiver it is allowed 90 days after the date the request for waiver was mailed in which to submit its defenses. Because of the additional time needed for mailing and the unreliability of some foreign mail services, a period of 60 days (rather than the 30 days required for domestic transmissions) is provided for a return of a waiver sent to a foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is hoped that, since transmission of the notice and waiver forms is a private nonjudicial act, does not purport to effect service, and is not accompanied by any summons or directive from a court, use of the procedure will not offend foreign sovereignties, even those that have withheld their assent to formal service by mail or have objected to the &ldquo;service-by-mail&rdquo; provisions of the former rule. Unless the addressee consents, receipt of the request under the revised rule does not give rise to any obligation to answer the lawsuit, does not provide a basis for default judgment, and does not suspend the statute of limitations in those states where the period continues to run until service. Nor are there any adverse consequences to a foreign defendant, since the provisions for shifting the expense of service to a defendant that declines to waive service apply only if the plaintiff and defendant are both located in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">With respect to a defendant located in a foreign country like the United Kingdom, which accepts documents in English, whose Central Authority acts promptly in effecting service, and whose policies discourage its residents from waiving formal service, there will be little reason for a plaintiff to send the notice and request under subdivision (d) rather than use convention methods. On the other hand, the procedure offers significant potential benefits to a plaintiff when suing a defendant that, though fluent in English, is located in a country where, as a condition to formal service under a convention, documents must be translated into another language or where formal service will be otherwise costly or time-consuming.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) is explicit that a timely waiver of service of a summons does not prejudice the right of a defendant to object by means of a motion authorized by Rule 12(b)(2) to the absence of jurisdiction over the defendant's person, or to assert other defenses that may be available. The only issues eliminated are those involving the sufficiency of the summons or the sufficiency of the method by which it is served.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) states what the present rule implies: the defendant has a duty to avoid costs associated with the service of a summons not needed to inform the defendant regarding the commencement of an action. The text of the rule also sets forth the requirements for a Notice and Request for Waiver sufficient to put the cost-shifting provision in place. These requirements are illustrated in Forms 1A and 1B, which replace the former Form 18&ndash;A.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2)(A) is explicit that a request for waiver of service by a corporate defendant must be addressed to a person qualified to receive service. The general mail rooms of large organizations cannot be required to identify the appropriate individual recipient for an institutional summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2)(B) permits the use of alternatives to the United States mails in sending the Notice and Request. While private messenger services or electronic communications may be more expensive than the mail, they may be equally reliable and on occasion more convenient to the parties. Especially with respect to transmissions to foreign countries, alternative means may be desirable, for in some countries facsimile transmission is the most efficient and economical means of communication. If electronic means such as facsimile transmission are employed, the sender should maintain a record of the transmission to assure proof of transmission if receipt is denied, but a party receiving such a transmission has a duty to cooperate and cannot avoid liability for the resulting cost of formal service if the transmission is prevented at the point of receipt.</p>
<p class="note-body">A defendant failing to comply with a request for waiver shall be given an opportunity to show good cause for the failure, but sufficient cause should be rare. It is not a good cause for failure to waive service that the claim is unjust or that the court lacks jurisdiction. Sufficient cause not to shift the cost of service would exist, however, if the defendant did not receive the request or was insufficiently literate in English to understand it. It should be noted that the provisions for shifting the cost of service apply only if the plaintiff and the defendant are both located in the United States, and accordingly a foreign defendant need not show &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; for its failure to waive service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) extends the time for answer if, before being served with process, the defendant waives formal service. The extension is intended to serve as an inducement to waive service and to assure that a defendant will not gain any delay by declining to waive service and thereby causing the additional time needed to effect service. By waiving service, a defendant is not called upon to respond to the complaint until 60 days from the date the notice was sent to it&mdash;90 days if the notice was sent to a foreign country&mdash;rather than within the 20 day period from date of service specified in Rule 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (4) clarifies the effective date of service when service is waived; the provision is needed to resolve an issue arising when applicable law requires service of process to toll the statute of limitations. <em>E.g., Morse v. Elmira Country Club</em>, 752 F.2d 35 (2d Cir. 1984). <em>Cf. Walker v. Armco Steel Corp</em>., 446 U.S. 740 (1980).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions in former subdivision (c)(2)(C)(ii) of this rule may have been misleading to some parties. Some plaintiffs, not reading the rule carefully, supposed that receipt by the defendant of the mailed complaint had the effect both of establishing the jurisdiction of the court over the defendant's person and of tolling the statute of limitations in actions in which service of the summons is required to toll the limitations period. The revised rule is clear that, if the waiver is not returned and filed, the limitations period under such a law is not tolled and the action will not otherwise proceed until formal service of process is effected.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some state limitations laws may toll an otherwise applicable statute at the time when the defendant receives notice of the action. Nevertheless, the device of requested waiver of service is not suitable if a limitations period which is about to expire is not tolled by filing the action. Unless there is ample time, the plaintiff should proceed directly to the formal methods for service identified in subdivisions (e), (f), or (h).</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedure of requesting waiver of service should also not be used if the time for service under subdivision (m) will expire before the date on which the waiver must be returned. While a plaintiff has been allowed additional time for service in that situation, <em>e.g., Prather v. Raymond Constr. Co</em>., 570 F. Supp. 278 (N.D. Ga. 1983), the court could refuse a request for additional time unless the defendant appears to have evaded service pursuant to subdivision (e) or (h). It may be noted that the presumptive time limit for service under subdivision (m) does not apply to service in a foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (5) is a cost-shifting provision retained from the former rule. The costs that may be imposed <!-- PDFPage:95 -->on the defendant could include, for example, the cost of the time of a process server required to make contact with a defendant residing in a guarded apartment house or residential development. The paragraph is explicit that the costs of enforcing the cost-shifting provision are themselves recoverable from a defendant who fails to return the waiver. In the absence of such a provision, the purpose of the rule would be frustrated by the cost of its enforcement, which is likely to be high in relation to the small benefit secured by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some plaintiffs may send a notice and request for waiver and, without waiting for return of the waiver, also proceed with efforts to effect formal service on the defendant. To discourage this practice, the cost-shifting provisions in paragraphs (2) and (5) are limited to costs of effecting service incurred after the time expires for the defendant to return the waiver. Moreover, by returning the waiver within the time allowed and before being served with process, a defendant receives the benefit of the longer period for responding to the complaint afforded for waivers under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. This subdivision replaces former subdivisions (c)(2)(C)(i) and (d)(1). It provides a means for service of summons on individuals within a judicial district of the United States. Together with subdivision (f), it provides for service on persons anywhere, subject to constitutional and statutory constraints.</p>
<p class="note-body">Service of the summons under this subdivision does not conclusively establish the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant. A defendant may assert the territorial limits of the court's reach set forth in subdivision (k), including the constitutional limitations that may be imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) authorizes service in any judicial district in conformity with state law. This paragraph sets forth the language of former subdivision (c)(2)(C)(i), which authorized the use of the law of the state in which the district court sits, but adds as an alternative the use of the law of the state in which the service is effected.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) retains the text of the former subdivision (d)(1) and authorizes the use of the familiar methods of personal or abode service or service on an authorized agent in any judicial district.</p>
<p class="note-body">To conform to these provisions, the former subdivision (e) bearing on proceedings against parties not found within the state is stricken. Likewise stricken is the first sentence of the former subdivision (f), which had restricted the authority of the federal process server to the state in which the district court sits.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. This subdivision provides for service on individuals who are in a foreign country, replacing the former subdivision (i) that was added to Rule 4 in 1963. Reflecting the pattern of Rule 4 in incorporating state law limitations on the exercise of jurisdiction over persons, the former subdivision (i) limited service outside the United States to cases in which extraterritorial service was authorized by state or federal law. The new rule eliminates the requirement of explicit authorization. On occasion, service in a foreign country was held to be improper for lack of statutory authority. <em>E.g., Martens v. Winder</em>, 341 F.2d 197 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 382 U.S. 937 (1965). This authority, however, was found to exist by implication. <em>E.g., SEC v. VTR, Inc</em>., 39 F.R.D. 19 (S.D.N.Y. 1966). Given the substantial increase in the number of international transactions and events that are the subject of litigation in federal courts, it is appropriate to infer a general legislative authority to effect service on defendants in a foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">A secondary effect of this provision for foreign service of a federal summons is to facilitate the use of federal long-arm law in actions brought to enforce the federal law against defendants who cannot be served under any state law but who can be constitutionally subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal court. Such a provision is set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (k) of this rule, applicable only to persons not subject to the territorial jurisdiction of any particular state.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) gives effect to the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents, which entered into force for the United States on February 10, 1969. See 28 U.S.C.A., Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 (Supp. 1986). This Convention is an important means of dealing with problems of service in a foreign country. <em>See generally</em> 1 B. Ristau, <em>International Judicial Assistance</em> &sect;&sect;4&ndash;1&ndash;1 to 4&ndash;5&ndash;2 (1990). Use of the Convention procedures, when available, is mandatory if documents must be transmitted abroad to effect service. <em>See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk</em>, 486 U.S. 694 (1988) (noting that voluntary use of these procedures may be desirable even when service could constitutionally be effected in another manner); J. Weis, <em>The Federal Rules and the Hague Conventions: Concerns of Conformity and Comity</em>, 50 <em>U. Pitt. L. Rev</em>. 903 (1989). Therefore, this paragraph provides that, when service is to be effected outside a judicial district of the United States, the methods of service appropriate under an applicable treaty shall be employed if available and if the treaty so requires.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Hague Convention furnishes safeguards against the abridgment of rights of parties through inadequate notice. Article 15 provides for verification of actual notice or a demonstration that process was served by a method prescribed by the internal laws of the foreign state before a default judgment may be entered. Article 16 of the Convention also enables the judge to extend the time for appeal after judgment if the defendant shows a lack of adequate notice either to defend or to appeal the judgment, or has disclosed a prima facie case on the merits.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Hague Convention does not specify a time within which a foreign country's Central Authority must effect service, but Article 15 does provide that alternate methods may be used if a Central Authority does not respond within six months. Generally, a Central Authority can be expected to respond much more quickly than that limit might permit, but there have been occasions when the signatory state was dilatory or refused to cooperate for substantive reasons. In such cases, resort may be had to the provision set forth in subdivision (f)(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">Two minor changes in the text reflect the Hague Convention. First, the term &ldquo;letter of request&rdquo; has been added. Although these words are synonymous with &ldquo;letter rogatory,&rdquo; &ldquo;letter of request&rdquo; is preferred in modern usage. The provision should not be interpreted to authorize use of a letter of request when there is in fact no treaty obligation on the receiving country to honor such a request from this country or when the United States does not extend diplomatic recognition to the foreign nation. Second, the passage formerly found in subdivision (i)(1)(B), &ldquo;when service in either case is reasonably calculated to give actual notice,&rdquo; has been relocated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) provides alternative methods for use when internationally agreed methods are not intended to be exclusive, or where there is no international agreement applicable. It contains most of the language formerly set forth in subdivision (i) of the rule. Service by methods that would violate foreign law is not generally authorized. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) prescribe the more appropriate methods for conforming to local practice or using a local authority. Subparagraph (C) prescribes other methods authorized by the former rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) authorizes the court to approve other methods of service not prohibited by international agreements. The Hague Convention, for example, authorizes special forms of service in cases of urgency if convention methods will not permit service within the time required by the circumstances. Other circumstances that might justify the use of additional methods include the failure of the foreign country's Central Authority to effect service within the six-month period provided by the Convention, or the refusal of the Central Authority to serve a complaint seeking punitive damages or to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States. In such cases, the court may direct a special <!-- PDFPage:96 -->method of service not explicitly authorized by international agreement if not prohibited by the agreement. Inasmuch as our Constitution requires that reasonable notice be given, an earnest effort should be made to devise a method of communication that is consistent with due process and minimizes offense to foreign law. A court may in some instances specially authorize use of ordinary mail. <em>Cf. Levin v. Ruby Trading Corp</em>., 248 F. Supp. 537 (S.D.N.Y. 1965).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. This subdivision retains the text of former subdivision (d)(2). Provision is made for service upon an infant or incompetent person in a foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em>. This subdivision retains the text of former subdivision (d)(3), with changes reflecting those made in subdivision (e). It also contains the provisions for service on a corporation or association in a foreign country, as formerly found in subdivision (i).</p>
<p class="note-body">Frequent use should be made of the Notice and Request procedure set forth in subdivision (d) in actions against corporations. Care must be taken, however, to address the request to an individual officer or authorized agent of the corporation. It is not effective use of the Notice and Request procedure if the mail is sent undirected to the mail room of the organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)</em>. This subdivision retains much of the text of former subdivisions (d)(4) and (d)(5). Paragraph (1) provides for service of a summons on the United States; it amends former subdivision (d)(4) to permit the United States attorney to be served by registered or certified mail. The rule does not authorize the use of the Notice and Request procedure of revised subdivision (d) when the United States is the defendant. To assure proper handling of mail in the United States attorney's office, the authorized mail service must be specifically addressed to the civil process clerk of the office of the United States attorney.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) replaces former subdivision (d)(5). Paragraph (3) saves the plaintiff from the hazard of losing a substantive right because of failure to comply with the complex requirements of multiple service under this subdivision. That risk has proved to be more than nominal. <em>E.g., Whale v. United States</em>, 792 F.2d 951 (9th Cir. 1986). This provision should be read in connection with the provisions of subdivision (c) of Rule 15 to preclude the loss of substantive rights against the United States or its agencies, corporations, or officers resulting from a plaintiff's failure to correctly identify and serve all the persons who should be named or served.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (j)</em>. This subdivision retains the text of former subdivision (d)(6) without material change. The waiver-of-service provision is also inapplicable to actions against governments subject to service pursuant to this subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision adds a new paragraph (1) referring to the statute governing service of a summons on a foreign state and its political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1608. The caption of the subdivision reflects that change.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (k)</em>. This subdivision replaces the former subdivision (f), with no change in the title. Paragraph (1) retains the substance of the former rule in explicitly authorizing the exercise of personal jurisdiction over persons who can be reached under state long-arm law, the &ldquo;100-mile bulge&rdquo; provision added in 1963, or the federal interpleader act. Paragraph (1)(D) is new, but merely calls attention to federal legislation that may provide for nationwide or even world-wide service of process in cases arising under particular federal laws. Congress has provided for nationwide service of process and full exercise of territorial jurisdiction by all district courts with respect to specified federal actions. <em>See</em> 1 R. Casad, <em>Jurisdiction in Civil Actions</em> (2d Ed.) chap. 5 (1991).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) is new. It authorizes the exercise of territorial jurisdiction over the person of any defendant against whom is made a claim arising under any federal law if that person is subject to personal jurisdiction in no state. This addition is a companion to the amendments made in revised subdivisions (e) and (f).</p>
<p class="note-body">This paragraph corrects a gap in the enforcement of federal law. Under the former rule, a problem was presented when the defendant was a non-resident of the United States having contacts with the United States sufficient to justify the application of United States law and to satisfy federal standards of forum selection, but having insufficient contact with any single state to support jurisdiction under state long-arm legislation or meet the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment limitation on state court territorial jurisdiction. In such cases, the defendant was shielded from the enforcement of federal law by the fortuity of a favorable limitation on the power of state courts, which was incorporated into the federal practice by the former rule. In this respect, the revision responds to the suggestion of the Supreme Court made in <em>Omni Capital Int'l v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd</em>., 484 U.S. 97, 111 (1987).</p>
<p class="note-body">There remain constitutional limitations on the exercise of territorial jurisdiction by federal courts over persons outside the United States. These restrictions arise from the Fifth Amendment rather than from the Fourteenth Amendment, which limits state-court reach and which was incorporated into federal practice by the reference to state law in the text of the former subdivision (e) that is deleted by this revision. The Fifth Amendment requires that any defendant have affiliating contacts with the United States sufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over that party. <em>Cf. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co</em>., 556 F.2d 406, 418 (9th Cir. 1977). There also may be a further Fifth Amendment constraint in that a plaintiff's forum selection might be so inconvenient to a defendant that it would be a denial of &ldquo;fair play and substantial justice&rdquo; required by the due process clause, even though the defendant had significant affiliating contacts with the United States. <em>See DeJames v. Magnificent Carriers</em>, 654 F.2d 280, 286 n.3 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 454 U.S. 1085 (1981). <em>Compare World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</em>, 444 U.S. 286, 293&ndash;294 (1980); <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee</em>, 456 U.S. 694, 702&ndash;03 (1982); <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz</em>, 471 U.S. 462, 476&ndash;78 (1985); <em>Asahi Metal Indus. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano County</em>, 480 U.S. 102, 108&ndash;13 (1987). <em>See generally</em> R. Lusardi, <em>Nationwide Service of Process: Due Process Limitations on the Power of the Sovereign</em>, 33 <em>Vill. L. Rev</em>. 1 (1988).</p>
<p class="note-body">This provision does not affect the operation of federal venue legislation. <em>See generally</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;1391. Nor does it affect the operation of federal law providing for the change of venue. 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1404, 1406. The availability of transfer for fairness and convenience under &sect;1404 should preclude most conflicts between the full exercise of territorial jurisdiction permitted by this rule and the Fifth Amendment requirement of &ldquo;fair play and substantial justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The district court should be especially scrupulous to protect aliens who reside in a foreign country from forum selections so onerous that injustice could result. &ldquo;[G]reat care and reserve should be exercised when extending our notions of personal jurisdiction into the international field.&rdquo; <em>Asahi Metal Indus. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano County</em>, 480 U.S. 102, 115 (1987), quoting <em>United States v. First Nat'l City Bank</em>, 379 U.S. 378, 404 (1965) (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="note-body">This narrow extension of the federal reach applies only if a claim is made against the defendant under federal law. It does not establish personal jurisdiction if the only claims are those arising under state law or the law of another country, even though there might be diversity or alienage subject matter jurisdiction as to such claims. If, however, personal jurisdiction is established under this paragraph with respect to a federal claim, then 28 U.S.C. &sect;1367(a) provides supplemental jurisdiction over related claims against that defendant, subject to the court's discretion to decline exercise of that jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1367(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (l)</em>. This subdivision assembles in one place all the provisions of the present rule bearing on <!-- PDFPage:97 -->proof of service. No material change in the rule is effected. The provision that proof of service can be amended by leave of court is retained from the former subdivision (h). <em>See generally</em> 4A Wright & Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;1132 (2d ed. 1987).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (m)</em>. This subdivision retains much of the language of the present subdivision (j).</p>
<p class="note-body">The new subdivision explicitly provides that the court shall allow additional time if there is good cause for the plaintiff's failure to effect service in the prescribed 120 days, and authorizes the court to relieve a plaintiff of the consequences of an application of this subdivision even if there is no good cause shown. Such relief formerly was afforded in some cases, partly in reliance on Rule 6(b). Relief may be justified, for example, if the applicable statute of limitations would bar the refiled action, or if the defendant is evading service or conceals a defect in attempted service. <em>E.g., Ditkof v. Owens-Illinois, Inc</em>., 114 F.R.D. 104 (E.D. Mich. 1987). A specific instance of good cause is set forth in paragraph (3) of this rule, which provides for extensions if necessary to correct oversights in compliance with the requirements of multiple service in actions against the United States or its officers, agencies, and corporations. The district court should also take care to protect <em>pro se</em> plaintiffs from consequences of confusion or delay attending the resolution of an <em>in forma pauperis</em> petition. <em>Robinson v. America's Best Contacts & Eyeglasses</em>, 876 F.2d 596 (7th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="note-body">The 1983 revision of this subdivision referred to the &ldquo;party on whose behalf such service was required,&rdquo; rather than to the &ldquo;plaintiff,&rdquo; a term used generically elsewhere in this rule to refer to any party initiating a claim against a person who is not a party to the action. To simplify the text, the revision returns to the usual practice in the rule of referring simply to the plaintiff even though its principles apply with equal force to defendants who may assert claims against non-parties under Rules 13(h), 14, 19, 20, or 21.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (n)</em>. This subdivision provides for in rem and quasi-in-rem jurisdiction. Paragraph (1) incorporates any requirements of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1655 or similar provisions bearing on seizures or liens.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) provides for other uses of quasi-in-rem jurisdiction but limits its use to exigent circumstances. Provisional remedies may be employed as a means to secure jurisdiction over the property of a defendant whose person is not within reach of the court, but occasions for the use of this provision should be rare, as where the defendant is a fugitive or assets are in imminent danger of disappearing. Until 1963, it was not possible under Rule 4 to assert jurisdiction in a federal court over the property of a defendant not personally served. The 1963 amendment to subdivision (e) authorized the use of state law procedures authorizing seizures of assets as a basis for jurisdiction. Given the liberal availability of long-arm jurisdiction, the exercise of power quasi-in-rem has become almost an anachronism. Circumstances too spare to affiliate the defendant to the forum state sufficiently to support long-arm jurisdiction over the defendant's person are also inadequate to support seizure of the defendant's assets fortuitously found within the state. <em>Shaffer v. Heitner</em>, 433 U.S. 186 (1977).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2)(B) is added to Rule 4(i) to require service on the United States when a United States officer or employee is sued in an individual capacity for acts or omissions occurring in connection with duties performed on behalf of the United States. Decided cases provide uncertain guidance on the question whether the United States must be served in such actions. <em>See Vaccaro v. Dobre</em>, 81 F.3d 854, 856&ndash;857 (9th Cir. 1996); <em>Armstrong v. Sears</em>, 33 F.3d 182, 185&ndash;187 (2d Cir. 1994); <em>Ecclesiastical Order of the Ism of Am v. Chasin</em>, 845 F.2d 113, 116 (6th Cir. 1988); <em>Light v. Wolf</em>, 816 F.2d 746 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <em>see also Simpkins v. District of Columbia</em>, 108 F.3d 366, 368&ndash;369 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Service on the United States will help to protect the interest of the individual defendant in securing representation by the United States, and will expedite the process of determining whether the United States will provide representation. It has been understood that the individual defendant must be served as an individual defendant, a requirement that is made explicit. Invocation of the individual service provisions of subdivisions (e), (f), and (g) invokes also the waiver-of-service provisions of subdivision (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph 2(B) reaches service when an officer or employee of the United States is sued in an individual capacity &ldquo;for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the performance of duties on behalf of the United States.&rdquo; This phrase has been chosen as a functional phrase that can be applied without the occasionally distracting associations of such phrases as &ldquo;scope of employment,&rdquo; &ldquo;color of office,&rdquo; or &ldquo;arising out of the employment.&rdquo; Many actions are brought against individual federal officers or employees of the United States for acts or omissions that have no connection whatever to their governmental roles. There is no reason to require service on the United States in these actions. The connection to federal employment that requires service on the United States must be determined as a practical matter, considering whether the individual defendant has reasonable grounds to look to the United States for assistance and whether the United States has reasonable grounds for demanding formal notice of the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">An action against a former officer or employee of the United States is covered by paragraph (2)(B) in the same way as an action against a present officer or employee. Termination of the relationship between the individual defendant and the United States does not reduce the need to serve the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) is amended to ensure that failure to serve the United States in an action governed by paragraph 2(B) does not defeat an action. This protection is adopted because there will be cases in which the plaintiff reasonably fails to appreciate the need to serve the United States. There is no requirement, however, that the plaintiff show that the failure to serve the United States was reasonable. A reasonable time to effect service on the United States must be allowed after the failure is pointed out. An additional change ensures that if the United States or United States attorney is served in an action governed by paragraph 2(A), additional time is to be allowed even though no officer, employee, agency, or corporation of the United States was served.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report</em>. The most important changes were made to ensure that no one would read the seemingly independent provisions of paragraphs 2(A) and 2(B) to mean that service must be made twice both on the United States and on the United States employee when the employee is sued in both official and individual capacities. The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; was added in subparagraph (A) and the new phrase &ldquo;whether or not the officer or employee is sued also in an individual capacity&rdquo; was inserted in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made to include &ldquo;Employees&rdquo; in the catchline for subdivision (i), and to add &ldquo;or employee&rdquo; in paragraph 2(A). Although it may seem awkward to think of suit against an employee in an official capacity, there is no clear definition that separates &ldquo;officers&rdquo; from &ldquo;employees&rdquo; for this purpose. The published proposal to amend Rule 12(a)(3) referred to actions against an employee sued in an official capacity, and it seemed better to make the rules parallel by adding &ldquo;employee&rdquo; to Rule 4(i)(2)(A) than by deleting it from Rule 12(a)(3)(A).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body">1983&mdash;Subd. (a). Pub. L. 97&ndash;462, &sect;2(1), substituted &ldquo;deliver the summons to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney, who shall be responsible for prompt service of the summons and a copy of the complaint&rdquo; for &ldquo;deliver it for service to the marshal or to any other person authorized by Rule 4(c) to serve it&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subd. (c). Pub. L. 97&ndash;462, &sect;2(2), substituted provision with subd. heading &ldquo;Service&rdquo; for provision with subd. <!-- PDFPage:98 -->heading &ldquo;By Whom Served&rdquo; which read: &ldquo;Service of process shall be made by a United States marshal, by his deputy, or by some person specially appointed by the court for that purpose, except that a subpoena may be served as provided in Rule 45. Special appointments to serve process shall be made freely. Service of process may also be made by a person authorized to serve process in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of the state in which the district court is held or in which service is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subd. (d). Pub. L. 97&ndash;462, &sect;2(3), (4), substituted &ldquo;Summons and Complaint: Person to be Served&rdquo; for &ldquo;Summons: Personal Service&rdquo; in subd. heading.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993</h4>
<p class="note-body">This is a new rule. Its purpose is to separate those few provisions of the former Rule 4 bearing on matters other than service of a summons to allow greater textual clarity in Rule 4. Subdivision (a) contains no new language.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) replaces the final clause of the penultimate sentence of the former subdivision 4(f), a clause added to the rule in 1963. The new rule provides for nationwide service of orders of civil commitment enforcing decrees of injunctions issued to compel compliance with federal law. The rule makes no change in the practice with respect to the enforcement of injunctions or decrees not involving the enforcement of federally-created rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">Service of process is not required to notify a party of a decree or injunction, or of an order that the party show cause why that party should not be held in contempt of such an order. With respect to a party who has once been served with a summons, the service of the decree or injunction itself or of an order to show cause can be made pursuant to Rule 5. Thus, for example, an injunction may be served on a party through that person's attorney. <em>Chagas v. United States</em>, 369 F.2d 643 (5th Cir. 1966). The same is true for service of an order to show cause. <em>Waffenschmidt v. Mackay</em>, 763 F.2d 711 (5th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="note-body">The new rule does not affect the reach of the court to impose criminal contempt sanctions. Nationwide enforcement of federal decrees and injunctions is already available with respect to criminal contempt: a federal court may effect the arrest of a criminal contemnor anywhere in the United States, 28 U.S.C. &sect;3041, and a contemnor when arrested may be subject to removal to the district in which punishment may be imposed. Fed. R. Crim. P. 40. Thus, the present law permits criminal contempt enforcement against a contemnor wherever that person may be found.</p>
<p class="note-body">The effect of the revision is to provide a choice of civil or criminal contempt sanctions in those situations to which it applies. Contempt proceedings, whether civil or criminal, must be brought in the court that was allegedly defied by a contumacious act. <em>Ex parte Bradley</em>, 74 U.S. 366 (1869). This is so even if the offensive conduct or inaction occurred outside the district of the court in which the enforcement proceeding must be conducted. <em>E.g., McCourtney v. United States</em>, 291 Fed. 497 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 263 U.S. 714 (1923). For this purpose, the rule as before does not distinguish between parties and other persons subject to contempt sanctions by reason of their relation or connection to parties.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Service: When Required</cap-smallcap>. Except as otherwise provided in these rules, every order required by its terms to be served, every pleading subsequent to the original complaint unless the court otherwise orders because of numerous defendants, every paper relating to discovery required to be served upon a party unless the court otherwise orders, every written motion other than one which may be heard ex parte, and every written notice, appearance, demand, offer of judgment, designation of record on appeal, and similar paper shall be served upon each of the parties. No service need be made on parties in default for failure to appear except that pleadings asserting new or additional claims for relief against them shall be served upon them in the manner provided for service of summons in Rule 4.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In an action begun by seizure of property, in which no person need be or is named as defendant, any service required to be made prior to the filing of an answer, claim, or appearance shall be made upon the person having custody or possession of the property at the time of its seizure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Making Service.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Service under Rules 5(a) and 77(d) on a party represented by an attorney is made on <!-- PDFPage:99 -->the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Service under Rule 5(a) is made by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Delivering a copy to the person served by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) handing it to the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) leaving it at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge, or if no one is in charge leaving it in a conspicuous place in the office; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) if the person has no office or the office is closed, leaving it at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion residing there.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Mailing a copy to the last known address of the person served. Service by mail is complete on mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the person served has no known address, leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Delivering a copy by any other means, including electronic means, consented to in writing by the person served. Service by electronic means is complete on transmission; service by other consented means is complete when the person making service delivers the copy to the agency designated to make delivery. If authorized by local rule, a party may make service under this subparagraph (D) through the court's transmission facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Service by electronic means under Rule 5(b)(2)(D) is not effective if the party making service learns that the attempted service did not reach the person to be served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Same: Numerous Defendants</cap-smallcap>. In any action in which there are unusually large numbers of defendants, the court, upon motion or of its own initiative, may order that service of the pleadings of the defendants and replies thereto need not be made as between the defendants and that any cross-claim, counterclaim, or matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense contained therein shall be deemed to be denied or avoided by all other parties and that the filing of any such pleading and service thereof upon the plaintiff constitutes due notice of it to the parties. A copy of every such order shall be served upon the parties in such manner and form as the court directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Filing; Certificate of Service</cap-smallcap>. All papers after the complaint required to be served upon a party, together with a certificate of service, must be filed with the court within a reasonable time after service, but disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: (i) depositions, (ii) interrogatories, (iii) requests for documents or to permit entry upon land, and (iv) requests for admission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Filing with the Court Defined</cap-smallcap>. The filing of papers with the court as required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the clerk of court, except that the judge may permit the papers to be filed with the judge, in which event the judge shall note thereon the filing date and forthwith transmit them to the office of the clerk. A court may by local rule permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance with a local rule constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules. The clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or any local rules or practices.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;affected thereby,&rdquo; stricken out by the amendment, introduced a problem of interpretation. See 1 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> 760&ndash;61 (Wright ed. 1960). The amendment eliminates this difficulty and promotes full exchange of information among the parties by requiring service of papers on all the parties to the action, except as otherwise provided in the rules. See also subdivision (c) of Rule 5. So, for example, a third-party defendant is required to serve his answer to the third-party complaint not only upon the defendant but also upon the plaintiff. See amended Form 22&ndash;A and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to the method of serving papers upon a party whose address is unknown, see Rule 5(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment makes clear that all papers relating to discovery which are required to be served on any party must be served on all parties, unless the court orders otherwise. The present language expressly includes notices and demands, but it is not explicit as to answers or responses as provided in Rules 33, 34, and 36. Discovery papers may be voluminous or the parties numerous, and the court is empowered to vary the requirement if in a given case it proves needlessly onerous.</p>
<p class="note-body">In actions begun by seizure of property, service will at times have to be made before the absent owner of the property has filed an appearance. For example, a prompt deposition may be needed in a maritime action in rem. See Rules 30(a) and 30(b)(2) and the related notes. A provision is added authorizing service on the person having custody or possession of the property at the time of its seizure.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1980 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. By the terms of this rule and Rule 30(f)(1) discovery materials must be promptly filed, although it often happens that no use is made of the materials after they are filed. Because the copies required for filing are an added expense and the large volume of discovery filings presents serious problems of storage in some districts, the Committee in 1978 first proposed that discovery materials not be filed unless on order of the court or for use in the proceedings. But such mate<!-- PDFPage:100 -->rials are sometimes of interest to those who may have no access to them except by a requirement of filing, such as members of a class, litigants similarly situated, or the public generally. Accordingly, this amendment and a change in Rule 30(f)(1) continue the requirement of filing but make it subject to an order of the court that discovery materials not be filed unless filing is requested by the court or is effected by parties who wish to use the materials in the proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This subdivision is amended to require that the person making service under the rule certify that service has been effected. Such a requirement has generally been imposed by local rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Having such information on file may be useful for many purposes, including proof of service if an issue arises concerning the effectiveness of the service. The certificate will generally specify the date as well as the manner of service, but parties employing private delivery services may sometimes be unable to specify the date of delivery. In the latter circumstance, a specification of the date of transmission of the paper to the delivery service may be sufficient for the purposes of this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The words <em>&ldquo;pleading and other&rdquo;</em> are stricken as unnecessary. Pleadings are papers within the meaning of the rule. The revision also accommodates the development of the use of facsimile transmission for filing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several local district rules have directed the office of the clerk to refuse to accept for filing papers not conforming to certain requirements of form imposed by local rules or practice. This is not a suitable role for the office of the clerk, and the practice exposes litigants to the hazards of time bars; for these reasons, such rules are proscribed by this revision. The enforcement of these rules and of the local rules is a role for a judicial officer. A clerk may of course advise a party or counsel that a particular instrument is not in proper form, and may be directed to so inform the court.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This is a technical amendment, using the broader language of Rule 25 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The district court&mdash;and the bankruptcy court by virtue of a cross-reference in Bankruptcy Rule 7005&mdash;can, by local rule, permit filing not only by facsimile transmissions but also by other electronic means, subject to standards approved by the Judicial Conference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The present Rule 5(e) has authorized filing by facsimile or other electronic means on two conditions. The filing must be authorized by local rule. Use of this means of filing must be authorized by the Judicial Conference of the United States and must be consistent with standards established by the Judicial Conference. Attempts to develop Judicial Conference standards have demonstrated the value of several adjustments in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The most significant change discards the requirement that the Judicial Conference authorize local electronic filing rules. As before, each district may decide for itself whether it has the equipment and personnel required to establish electronic filing, but a district that wishes to establish electronic filing need no longer await Judicial Conference action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The role of the Judicial Conference standards is clarified by specifying that the standards are to govern technical matters. Technical standards can provide nationwide uniformity, enabling ready use of electronic filing without pausing to adjust for the otherwise inevitable variations among local rules. Judicial Conference adoption of technical standards should prove superior to specification in these rules. Electronic technology has advanced with great speed. The process of adopting Judicial Conference standards should prove speedier and more flexible in determining the time for the first uniform standards, in adjusting standards at appropriate intervals, and in sparing the Supreme Court and Congress the need to consider technological details. Until Judicial Conference standards are adopted, however, uniformity will occur only to the extent that local rules deliberately seek to copy other local rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is anticipated that Judicial Conference standards will govern such technical specifications as data formatting, speed of transmission, means to transmit copies of supporting documents, and security of communication. Perhaps more important, standards must be established to assure proper maintenance and integrity of the record and to provide appropriate access and retrieval mechanisms. Local rules must address these issues until Judicial Conference standards are adopted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule also makes clear the equality of filing by electronic means with written filings. An electronic filing that complies with the local rule satisfies all requirements for filing on paper, signature, or verification. An electronic filing that otherwise satisfies the requirements of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 need not be separately made in writing. Public access to electronic filings is governed by the same rules as govern written filings.</p>
<p class="note-body">The separate reference to filing by facsimile transmission is deleted. Facsimile transmission continues to be included as an electronic means.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Rule 5(d) is amended to provide that disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), and discovery requests and responses under Rules 30, 31, 33, 34, and 36 must not be filed until they are used in the action. &ldquo;Discovery requests&rdquo; includes deposition notices and &ldquo;discovery responses&rdquo; includes objections. The rule supersedes and invalidates local rules that forbid, permit, or require filing of these materials before they are used in the action. The former Rule 26(a)(4) requirement that disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) and (2) be filed has been removed. Disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3), however, must be promptly filed as provided in Rule 26(a)(3). Filings in connection with Rule 35 examinations, which involve a motion proceeding when the parties do not agree, are unaffected by these amendments.</p>
<p class="note-body">Recognizing the costs imposed on parties and courts by required filing of discovery materials that are never used in an action, Rule 5(d) was amended in 1980 to authorize court orders that excuse filing. Since then, many districts have adopted local rules that excuse or forbid filing. In 1989 the Judicial Conference Local Rules Project concluded that these local rules were inconsistent with Rule 5(d), but urged the Advisory Committee to consider amending the rule. <em>Local Rules Project</em> at 92 (1989). The Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit gave the Committee similar advice in 1997. The reality of nonfiling reflected in these local rules has even been assumed in drafting the national rules. In 1993, Rule 30(f)(1) was amended to direct that the officer presiding at a deposition file it with the court or send it to the attorney who arranged for the transcript or recording. The Committee Note explained that this alternative to filing was designed for &ldquo;courts which direct that depositions not be automatically filed.&rdquo; Rule 30(f)(1) has been amended to conform to this change in Rule 5(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although this amendment is based on widespread experience with local rules, and confirms the results directed by these local rules, it is designed to supersede and invalidate local rules. There is no apparent reason to have different filing rules in different districts. Even if districts vary in present capacities to store filed ma<!-- PDFPage:101 -->terials that are not used in an action, there is little reason to continue expending court resources for this purpose. These costs and burdens would likely change as parties make increased use of audio- and videotaped depositions. Equipment to facilitate review and reproduction of such discovery materials may prove costly to acquire, maintain, and operate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule provides that discovery materials and disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) and (a)(2) must not be filed until they are &ldquo;used in the proceeding.&rdquo; This phrase is meant to refer to proceedings in court. This filing requirement is not triggered by &ldquo;use&rdquo; of discovery materials in other discovery activities, such as depositions. In connection with proceedings in court, however, the rule is to be interpreted broadly; any use of discovery materials in court in connection with a motion, a pretrial conference under Rule 16, or otherwise, should be interpreted as use in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Once discovery or disclosure materials are used in the proceeding, the filing requirements of Rule 5(d) should apply to them. But because the filing requirement applies only with regard to materials that are used, only those parts of voluminous materials that are actually used need be filed. Any party would be free to file other pertinent portions of materials that are so used. <em>See</em> Fed. R. Evid. 106; <em>cf</em>. Rule 32(a)(4). If the parties are unduly sparing in their submissions, the court may order further filings. By local rule, a court could provide appropriate direction regarding the filing of discovery materials, such as depositions, that are used in proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Shall&rdquo; is replaced by &ldquo;must&rdquo; under the program to conform amended rules to current style conventions when there is no ambiguity.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report</em>. The Advisory Committee recommends no changes to either the amendments to Rule 5(d) or the Committee Note as published.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes On Rules&mdash;2001 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b) is restyled.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b)(1) makes it clear that the provision for service on a party's attorney applies only to service made under Rules 5(a) and 77(d). Service under Rules 4, 4.1, 45(b), and 71A(d)(3)&mdash;as well as rules that invoke those rules&mdash;must be made as provided in those rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of Rule 5(b)(2) carry forward the method-of-service provisions of former Rule 5(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (D) of Rule 5(b)(2) is new. It authorizes service by electronic means or any other means, but only if consent is obtained from the person served. The consent must be express, and cannot be implied from conduct. Early experience with electronic filing as authorized by Rule 5(d) is positive, supporting service by electronic means as well. Consent is required, however, because it is not yet possible to assume universal entry into the world of electronic communication. Subparagraph (D) also authorizes service by nonelectronic means. The Rule 5(b)(2)(B) provision making mail service complete on mailing is extended in subparagraph (D) to make service by electronic means complete on transmission; transmission is effected when the sender does the last act that must be performed by the sender. Service by other agencies is complete on delivery to the designated agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, subparagraph (D) authorizes adoption of local rules providing for service through the court. Electronic case filing systems will come to include the capacity to make service by using the court's facilities to transmit all documents filed in the case. It may prove most efficient to establish an environment in which a party can file with the court, making use of the court's transmission facilities to serve the filed paper on all other parties. Transmission might be by such means as direct transmission of the paper, or by transmission of a notice of filing that includes an electronic link for direct access to the paper. Because service is under subparagraph (D), consent must be obtained from the persons served.</p>
<p class="note-body">Consent to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(D) must be in writing, which can be provided by electronic means. Parties are encouraged to specify the scope and duration of the consent. The specification should include at least the persons to whom service should be made, the appropriate address or location for such service&mdash;such as the e-mail address or facsimile machine number, and the format to be used for attachments. A district court may establish a registry or other facility that allows advance consent to service by specified means for future actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 6(e) is amended to allow additional time to respond when service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(D). The additional time does not relieve a party who consents to service under Rule 5(b)(2)(D) of the responsibilities to monitor the facility designated for receiving service and to provide prompt notice of any address change.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) addresses a question that may arise from a literal reading of the provision that service by electronic means is complete on transmission. Electronic communication is rapidly improving, but lawyers report continuing failures of transmission, particularly with respect to attachments. Ordinarily the risk of non-receipt falls on the person being served, who has consented to this form of service. But the risk should not extend to situations in which the person attempting service learns that the attempted service in fact did not reach the person to be served. Given actual knowledge that the attempt failed, service is not effected. The person attempting service must either try again or show circumstances that justify dispensing with service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) does not address the similar questions that may arise when a person attempting service learns that service by means other than electronic means in fact did not reach the person to be served. Case law provides few illustrations of circumstances in which a person attempting service actually knows that the attempt failed but seeks to act as if service had been made. This negative history suggests there is no need to address these problems in Rule 5(b)(3). This silence does not imply any view on these issues, nor on the circumstances that justify various forms of judicial action even though service has not been made.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em> Rule 5(b)(2)(D) was changed to require that consent be &ldquo;in writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b)(3) is new. The published proposal did not address the question of failed service in the text of the rule. Instead, the Committee Note included this statement: &ldquo;As with other modes of service, however, actual notice that the transmission was not received defeats the presumption of receipt that arises from the provision that service is complete on transmission. The sender must take additional steps to effect service. Service by other agencies is complete on delivery to the designated agency.&rdquo; The addition of paragraph (3) was prompted by consideration of the draft Appellate Rule 25(c) that was prepared for the meeting of the Appellate Rules Advisory Committee. This draft provided: &ldquo;Service by electronic means is complete on transmission, unless the party making service is notified that the paper was not received.&rdquo; Although Appellate Rule 25(c) is being prepared for publication and comment, while Civil Rule 5(b) has been published and otherwise is ready to recommend for adoption, it seemed desirable to achieve some parallel between the two rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The draft Rule 5(b)(3) submitted for consideration by the Advisory Committee covered all means of service except for leaving a copy with the clerk of the court when the person to be served has no known address. It was not limited to electronic service for fear that a provision limited to electronic service might generate unintended negative implications as to service by other means, particularly mail. This concern was strengthened by a small number of opinions that say that service by mail is effective, because complete on mailing, even when the person making service has prompt actual notice that the mail was not delivered. The Advisory Committee voted to limit Rule 5(b)(3) to service by electronic means because this means of service is <!-- PDFPage:102 -->relatively new, and seems likely to miscarry more frequently than service by post. It was suggested during the Advisory Committee meeting that the question of negative implication could be addressed in the Committee Note. There was little discussion of this possibility. The Committee Note submitted above includes a &ldquo;no negative implications&rdquo; paragraph prepared by the Reporter for consideration by the Standing Committee.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee did not consider at all a question that was framed during the later meeting of the Appellate Rules Advisory Committee. As approved by the Advisory Committee, Rule 5(b)(3) defeats service by electronic means &ldquo;if the party making service learns that the attempted service did not reach the person to be served.&rdquo; It says nothing about the time relevant to learning of the failure. The omission may seem glaring. Curing the omission, however, requires selection of a time. As revised, proposed Appellate Rule 25(c) requires that the party making service learn of the failure within three calendar days. The Appellate Rules Advisory Committee will have the luxury of public comment and another year to consider the desirability of this short period. If Civil Rule 5(b) is to be recommended for adoption now, no such luxury is available. This issue deserves careful consideration by the Standing Committee.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several changes are made in the Committee Note. (1) It requires that consent &ldquo;be express, and cannot be implied from conduct.&rdquo; This addition reflects a more general concern stimulated by a reported ruling that an e-mail address on a firm's letterhead implied consent to email service. (2) The paragraph discussing service through the court's facilities is expanded by describing alternative methods, including an &ldquo;electronic link.&rdquo; (3) There is a new paragraph that states that the requirement of written consent can be satisfied by electronic means, and that suggests matters that should be addressed by the consent. (4) A paragraph is added to note the additional response time provided by amended Rule 6(e). (5) The final two paragraphs address newly added Rule 5(b)(3). The first explains the rule that electronic service is not effective if the person making service learns that it did not reach the person to be served. The second paragraph seeks to defeat any negative implications that might arise from limiting Rule 5(b)(3) to electronic service, not mail, not other means consented to such as commercial express service, and not service on another person on behalf of the person to be served.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Rule 6(e)</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee recommended that no change be made in Civil Rule 6(e) to reflect the provisions of Civil Rule 5(b)(2)(D) that, with the consent of the person to be served, would allow service by electronic or other means. Absent change, service by these means would not affect the time for acting in response to the paper served. Comment was requested, however, on the alternative that would allow an additional 3 days to respond. The alternative Rule 6(e) amendments are cast in a form that permits ready incorporation in the Bankruptcy Rules. Several of the comments suggest that the added three days should be provided. Electronic transmission is not always instantaneous, and may fail for any of a number of reasons. It may take three days to arrange for transmission in readable form. Providing added time to respond will not discourage people from asking for consent to electronic transmission, and may encourage people to give consent. The more who consent, the quicker will come the improvements that will make electronic service ever more attractive. Consistency with the Bankruptcy Rules will be a good thing, and the Bankruptcy Rules Advisory Committee believes the additional three days should be allowed.</p>

The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, when the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court, a day on which weather or other conditions have made the office of the clerk of the district court inaccessible, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. As used in this rule and in Rule 77(c), &ldquo;legal holiday&rdquo; includes New Year's Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and any other day appointed as a holiday by the President or the Congress of the United States, or by the state in which the district court is held.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em>. These are amplifications along lines common in state practices, of [former] Equity Rule 80 (Computation of Time&mdash;Sundays and Holidays) and of the provisions for enlargement of time found in [former] Equity Rules 8 (Enforcement of Final Decrees) and 16 (Defendant to Answer&mdash;Default&mdash;Decree Pro Confesso). See also Rule XIII, Rules and Forms in Criminal Cases, 292 U.S. 661, 666 (1934). Compare Ala.Code Ann.

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the finality of judgments. Prior to the advent of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the general rule that a court loses jurisdiction to disturb its judgments, upon the expiration of the term at which they were entered, had long been the classic device which (together with the statutory limits on the time for appeal) gave finality to judgments. See Note to Rule 73(a). Rule 6(c) abrogates that limit on judicial power. That limit was open to many objections, one of them being inequality of operation because, under it, the time for vacating a judgment rendered early in a term was much longer than for a judgment rendered near the end of the term.</p>
<p class="note-body">The question to be met under Rule 6(b) is: how far should the desire to allow correction of judgments be allowed to postpone their finality? The rules contain a number of provisions permitting the vacation or modification of judgments on various grounds. Each of these rules contains express time limits on the motions for granting of relief. Rule 6(b) is a rule of general application giving wide discretion to the court to enlarge these time limits or revive them after they have expired, the only exceptions stated in the original rule being a prohibition against enlarging the time specified in Rule 59(b) and (d) for making motions for or granting new trials, and a prohibition against enlarging the time fixed by law for taking an appeal. It should also be noted that Rule 6(b) itself contains no limitation of time within which the court may exercise its discretion, and since the expiration of the term does not end its power, there is now no time limit on the exercise of its discretion under Rule 6(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Decisions of lower federal courts suggest that some of the rules containing time limits which may be set aside under Rule 6(b) are Rules 25, 50(b), 52(b), 60(b), and 73(g).</p>
<p class="note-body">In a number of cases the effect of Rule 6(b) on the time limitations of these rules has been considered. Certainly the rule is susceptible of the interpretation that the court is given the power in its discretion to relieve a party from failure to act within the times specified in any of these other rules, with only the exceptions stated in Rule 6(b), and in some cases the rule has been so construed.</p>
<p class="note-body">With regard to Rule 25(a) for substitution, it was held in <em>Anderson v. Brady</em> (E.D.Ky. 1941) 4 Fed.Rules Service 25a.1, Case 1, and in <em>Anderson v. Yungkau</em> (C.C.A. 6th, 1946) 153 F.(2d) 685, cert. granted (1946) 66 S.Ct. 1025, that under Rule 6(b) the court had no authority to allow substitution of parties after the expiration of the limit fixed in Rule 25(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">As to Rules 50(b) for judgments notwithstanding the verdict and 52(b) for amendment of findings and vacation of judgment, it was recognized in <em>Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co</em>. (1943) 318 U.S. 203, that Rule 6(b) allowed the district court to enlarge the time to make a motion for amended findings and judgment beyond the limit expressly fixed in Rule 52(b). See <em>Coca-Cola v. Busch</em> (E.D.Pa. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Service 59b.2, Case 4. Obviously, if the time limit in Rule 52(b) could be set aside under Rule 6(b), the time limit in Rule 50(b) for granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict (and thus vacating the judgment entered &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; on the verdict) likewise could be set aside.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to Rule 59 on motions for a new trial, it has been settled that the time limits in Rule 59(b) and (d) for making motions for or granting new trial could not be set aside under Rule 6(b), because Rule 6(b) expressly refers to Rule 59, and forbids it. See <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Coe</em> (App.D.C. 1943) 136 F.(2d) 771; <em>Jusino v. Morales & Tio</em> (C.C.A. 1st, 1944) 139 F.(2d) 946; <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Busch</em> (E.D.Pa. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Service 59b.2, Case 4; <em>Peterson v. Chicago Great Western Ry. Co</em>. (D.Neb. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Service 59b.2, Case 1; <em>Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co</em>. (1943) 318 U.S. 203.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to Rule 60(b) for relief from a judgment, it was held in <em>Schram v. O'Connor</em> (E.D.Mich. 1941) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 6b.31, Case 1, 2 F.R.D. 192, s. c. 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 6b.31, Case 2, F.R.D. 192, that the six-months time limit in original Rule 60(b) for making a motion for relief from a judgment for surprise, mistake, or excusable neglect could be set aside under Rule 6(b). The contrary result was reached in <em>Wallace v. United States</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 142 F.(2d) 240, cert. den. (1944) 323 U.S. 712; <em>Reed v. South Atlantic Steamship Co. of Del</em>. (D.Del. 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 60b.31, Case 1.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to Rule 73(g), fixing the time for docketing an appeal, it was held in <em>Ainsworth v. Gill Glass & Fixture Co</em>. (C.C.A.3d, 1939) 104 F.(2d) 83, that under Rule 6(b) the district court, upon motion made after the expiration of the forty-day period, stated in Rule 73(g), but before the expiration of the ninety-day period therein specified, could permit the docketing of the appeal on a showing of excusable neglect. The contrary was held in <em>Mutual Benefit Health & Accident Ass'n v. Snyder</em> (C.C.A. 6th, 1940) 109 F.(2d) 469 and in <em>Burke v. Canfield</em> (App.D.C. 1940) 111 F.(2d) 526.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of Rule 6(b) now proposed is based on the view that there should be a definite point where it can be said a judgment is final; that the right method of dealing with the problem is to list in Rule 6(b) the various other rules whose time limits may not be set aside, and then, if the time limit in any of those other rules is too short, to amend that other rule to give a longer time. The further argument is that Rule 6(c) abolished the long standing device to produce finality in judgments through expiration of the term, and since that limitation on the jurisdiction of courts to set aside their own judgments has been removed by Rule 6(c), some other limitation must be substituted or judgments never can be said to be final.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this connection reference is made to the established rule that if a motion for new trial is seasonably made, the mere making or pendency of the motion destroys the finality of the judgment, and even though the motion is ultimately denied, the full time for appeal starts anew from the date of denial. Also, a motion to amend the findings under Rule 52(b) has the same effect on the time for appeal. <em>Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co</em>. (1943) 318 U.S. 203. By the same reasoning a motion for judgment under Rule 50(b), involving as it does the vacation of a judgment entered &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; on the verdict (Rule 58), operates to postpone, until an order is made, the running of the time for appeal. The Committee believes that the abolition by Rule 6(c) of the old rule that a court's power over its judgments ends with the term, requires a substitute limitation, and that unless Rule 6(b) is amended to prevent enlargement of the times specified in Rules 50(b), 52(b) and 60(b), and the limitation as to Rule 59(b) and (d) is retained, no one can say when a judgment is final. This is also true with regard to proposed Rule 59(e), which authorizes a motion to alter or amend a judgment, hence that rule is also included in the enumeration in amended Rule 6(b). In consideration of the <!-- PDFPage:104 -->amendment, however, it should be noted that Rule 60(b) is also to be amended so as to lengthen the six-months period originally prescribed in that rule to one year.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to Rule 25 on substitution, while finality is not involved, the limit there fixed should be controlling. That rule, as amended, gives the court power, upon showing of a reasonable excuse, to permit substitution after the expiration of the two-year period.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to Rule 73(g), it is believed that the conflict in decisions should be resolved and not left to further litigation, and that the rule should be listed as one whose limitation may not be set aside under Rule 6(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">As to Rule 59(c), fixing the time for serving affidavits on motion for new trial, it is believed that the court should have authority under Rule 6(b) to enlarge the time, because, once the motion for new trial is made, the judgment no longer has finality, and the extension of time for affidavits thus does not of itself disturb finality.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes proposed in Rule 6(b) are merely clarifying and conforming. Thus &ldquo;request&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;application&rdquo; in clause (1) because an application is defined as a motion under Rule 7(b). The phrase &ldquo;extend the time&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;enlarge the period&rdquo; because the former is a more suitable expression and relates more clearly to both clauses (1) and (2). The final phrase in Rule 6(b), &ldquo;or the period for taking an appeal as provided by law&rdquo;, is deleted and a reference to Rule 73(a) inserted, since it is proposed to state in that rule the time for appeal to a circuit court of appeals, which is the only appeal governed by the Federal Rules, and allows an extension of time. See Rule 72.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The purpose of this amendment is to prevent reliance upon the continued existence of a term as a source of power to disturb the finality of a judgment upon grounds other than those stated in these rules. See <em>Hill v. Hawes</em> (1944) 320 U.S. 520; <em>Boaz v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York</em> (C.C.A. 8th, 1944) 146 F.(2d) 321; <em>Bucy v. Nevada Construction Co</em>. (C.C.A. 9th, 1942) 125 F.(2d) 213.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This amendment is related to the amendment of Rule 77(c) changing the regulation of the days on which the clerk's office shall be open.</p>
<p class="note-body">The wording of the first sentence of Rule 6(a) is clarified and the subdivision is made expressly applicable to computing periods of time set forth in local rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Saturday is to be treated in the same way as Sunday or a &ldquo;legal holiday&rdquo; in that it is not to be included when it falls on the last day of a computed period, nor counted as an intermediate day when the period is less than 7 days. &ldquo;Legal holiday&rdquo; is defined for purposes of this subdivision and amended Rule 77(c). Compare the definition of &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; in 11 U.S.C. &sect;1(18); also 5 U.S.C. &sect;86a; Executive Order No. 10358, &ldquo;Observance of Holidays,&rdquo; June 9, 1952, 17 Fed.Reg. 5269. In the light of these changes the last sentence of the present subdivision, dealing with half holidays, is eliminated.</p>
<p class="note-body">With Saturdays and State holidays made &ldquo;dies non&rdquo; in certain cases by the amended subdivision, computation of the usual 5&ndash;day notice of motion or the 2&ndash;day notice to dissolve or modify a temporary restraining order may work out so as to cause embarrassing delay in urgent cases. The delay can be obviated by applying to the court to shorten the time, see Rules 6(d) and 65(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The prohibition against extending the time for taking action under Rule 25 (Substitution of parties) is eliminated. The only limitation of time provided for in amended Rule 25 is the 90&ndash;day period following a suggestion upon the record of the death of a party within which to make a motion to substitute the proper parties for the deceased party. See Rule 25(a)(1), as amended, and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto. It is intended that the court shall have discretion to enlarge that period.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1968 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment eliminates the references to Rule 73, which is to be abrogated.</p>
<p class="note-body">P. L. 88&ndash;139, &sect;1, 77 Stat. 248, approved on October 16, 1963, amended 28 U.S.C. &sect;138 to read as follows: &ldquo;The district court shall not hold formal terms.&rdquo; Thus Rule 6(c) is rendered unnecessary, and it is rescinded.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1971 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays to conform the subdivision to the Act of June 28, 1968, 82 Stat. 250, which constituted Columbus Day a legal holiday effective after January 1, 1971.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act, which amended Title 5, U.S.C., &sect;6103(a), changes the day on which certain holidays are to be observed. Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day are to be observed on the third Monday in February, the last Monday in May and the fourth Monday in October, respectively, rather than, as heretofore, on February 22, May 30, and November 11, respectively. Columbus Day is to be observed on the second Monday in October. New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas continue to be observed on the traditional days.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The amendment confers finality upon the judgments of magistrates by foreclosing enlargement of the time for appeal except as provided in new Rule 74(a) (20 day period for demonstration of excusable neglect).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 6(a) is amended to acknowledge that weather conditions or other events may render the clerk's office inaccessible one or more days. Parties who are obliged to file something with the court during that period should not be penalized if they cannot do so. The amendment conforms to changes made in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a), effective August 1, 1982.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Rule also is amended to extend the exclusion of intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays to the computation of time periods less than 11 days. Under the current version of the Rule, parties bringing motions under rules with 10-day periods could have as few as 5 working days to prepare their motions. This hardship would be especially acute in the case of Rules 50(b) and (c)(2), 52(b), and 59(b), (d), and (e), which may not be enlarged at the discretion of the court. See Rule 6(b). If the exclusion of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays will operate to cause excessive delay in urgent cases, the delay can be obviated by applying to the court to shorten the time, See Rule 6(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., which becomes a legal holiday effective in 1986, has been added to the list of legal holidays enumerated in the Rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The reference to Rule 74(a) is stricken from the catalogue of time periods that cannot be extended by the district court. The change reflects the 1997 abrogation of Rule 74(a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2001 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The additional three days provided by Rule 6(e) is extended to the means of service authorized by the new paragraph (D) added to Rule 5(b), including&mdash;with the consent of the person served&mdash;service by electronic or other means. The three-day addition is provided as well <!-- PDFPage:105 -->for service on a person with no known address by leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. Proposed Rule 6(e) is the same as the &ldquo;alternative proposal&rdquo; that was published in August 1999.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 6(e) is amended to remove any doubt as to the method for extending the time to respond after service by mail, leaving with the clerk of court, electronic means, or other means consented to by the party served. Three days are added after the prescribed period otherwise expires under Rule 6(a). Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are included in counting these added three days. If the third day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the last day to act is the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The effect of invoking the day when the prescribed period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a) can be illustrated by assuming that the thirtieth day of a thirty-day period is a Saturday. Under Rule 6(a) the period expires on the next day that is not a Sunday or legal holiday. If the following Monday is a legal holiday, under Rule 6(a) the period expires on Tuesday. Three days are then added&mdash;Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday as the third and final day to act. If the period prescribed expires on a Friday, the three added days are Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, which is the third and final day to act unless it is a legal holiday. If Monday is a legal holiday, the next day that is not a legal holiday is the third and final day to act.</p>
<p class="note-body">Application of Rule 6(e) to a period that is less than eleven days can be illustrated by a paper that is served by mailing on a Friday. If ten days are allowed to respond, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in determining when the period expires under Rule 6(a). If there is no legal holiday, the period expires on the Friday two weeks after the paper was mailed. The three added Rule 6(e) days are Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, which is the third and final day to act unless it is a legal holiday. If Monday is a legal holiday, the next day that is not a legal holiday is the final day to act.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. Changes were made to clarify further the method of counting the three days added after service under Rule 5(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D).</p>
