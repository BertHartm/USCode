<h3 class="section-head">Rule 18. Joinder of Claims and Remedies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Joinder of Claims. A party asserting a claim to relief as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, may join, either as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims, legal or equitable, as the party has against an opposing party, except that in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(a), a party may join claims only if they involve a common issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Joinder of Remedies. Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to have set aside a conveyance fraudulent as to that plaintiff, without first having obtained a judgment establishing the claim for money.</p>
