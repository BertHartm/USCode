<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. A petition for a writ of certiorari shall contain, in the order indicated:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) The questions presented for review, expressed concisely in relation to the circumstances of the case, without unnecessary detail. The questions should be short and should not be argumentative or repetitive. If the petitioner or respondent is under a death sentence that may be affected by the disposition of the petition, the notation &ldquo;capital case&rdquo; shall precede the questions presented. The questions shall be set out on the first page following the cover, and no other information may appear on that page. The statement of any question presented is deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein. Only the questions set out in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) A list of all parties to the proceeding in the court whose judgment is sought to be reviewed (unless the caption of the case contains the names of all the parties), and a list of parent companies and nonwholly owned subsidiaries as required by Rule 29.6.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) If the petition exceeds five pages, a table of contents and a table of cited authorities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) Citations of the official and unofficial reports of the opinions and orders entered in the case by courts or administrative agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) A concise statement of the basis for jurisdiction in this Court, showing:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the date the judgment or order sought to be reviewed was entered (and, if applicable, a statement that the petition is filed under this Court's Rule 11);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the date of any order respecting rehearing, and the date and terms of any order granting an extension of time to file the petition for a writ of certiorari;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) express reliance on Rule 12.5, when a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari is filed under that Rule, and the date of docketing of the petition for a writ of certiorari in connection with which the cross-petition is filed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the statutory provision believed to confer on this Court jurisdiction to review on a writ of certiorari the judgment or order in question; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) if applicable, a statement that the notifications required by Rule 29.4(b) or (c) have been made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) The constitutional provisions, treaties, statutes, ordinances, and regulations involved in the case, set out verbatim with appropriate citation. If the provisions involved are lengthy, their citation alone suffices at this point, and their pertinent text shall be set out in the appendix referred to in subparagraph 1(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(g) A concise statement of the case setting out the facts material to consideration of the questions presented, and also containing the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If review of a state-court judgment is sought, specification of the stage in the proceedings, both in the court of first instance and in the appellate courts, when the federal questions sought to be reviewed were raised; the method or manner of raising them and the way in which they were passed on by those courts; and pertinent quotations of specific portions of the record or summary thereof, with specific reference to the places in the record where the matter appears (<em>e.g</em>., court opinion, ruling on exception, portion of court's charge and exception thereto, assignment of error), so as to show that the federal question was timely and properly raised and that this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment on a writ of certiorari. When the portions of the record relied on under this subparagraph are voluminous, they shall be included in the appendix referred to in subparagraph 1(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If review of a judgment of a United States court of appeals is sought, the basis for federal jurisdiction in the court of first instance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(h) A direct and concise argument amplifying the reasons relied on for allowance of the writ. See Rule 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) An appendix containing, in the order indicated:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the opinions, orders, findings of fact, and conclusions of law, whether written or orally given and transcribed, entered in conjunction with the judgment sought to be reviewed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any other relevant opinions, orders, findings of fact, and conclusions of law entered in the case by courts or administrative agencies, and, if reference thereto is necessary to ascertain the grounds of the judgment, of those in companion cases (each document shall include the caption showing the name of the issuing court or agency, the title and number of the case, and the date of entry);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any order on rehearing, including the caption showing the name of the issuing court, the title and number of the case, and the date of entry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the judgment sought to be reviewed if the date of its entry is different from the date of the opinion or order required in sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) material required by subparagraphs 1(f) or 1(g)(i); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) any other material the petitioner believes essential to understand the petition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the material required by this subparagraph is voluminous, it may be presented in a separate volume or volumes with appropriate covers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. All contentions in support of a petition for a writ of certiorari shall be set out in the body of the petition, as provided in subparagraph 1(h) of this Rule. No separate brief in support of a petition for a writ of certiorari may be filed, and the Clerk will not file any petition for a writ of <!-- PDFPage:339 -->certiorari to which any supporting brief is annexed or appended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. A petition for a writ of certiorari should be stated briefly and in plain terms and may not exceed the page limitations specified in Rule 33.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. The failure of a petitioner to present with accuracy, brevity, and clarity whatever is essential to ready and adequate understanding of the points requiring consideration is sufficient reason for the Court to deny a petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does not comply with this Rule or with Rule 33 or Rule 34, the Clerk will return it with a letter indicating the deficiency. A corrected petition received no more than 60 days after the date of the Clerk's letter will be deemed timely.</p>
