<h3 class="section-head">Rule 68. Offer of Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect <!-- PDFPage:209 -->specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment. An offer not accepted shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs. If the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer. The fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not preclude a subsequent offer. When the liability of one party to another has been determined by verdict or order or judgment, but the amount or extent of the liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party adjudged liable may make an offer of judgment, which shall have the same effect as an offer made before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not less than 10 days prior to the commencement of hearings to determine the amount or extent of liability.</p>

<p class="note-body">See 2 Minn. Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9323; 4 Mont. Rev. Codes Ann. (1935) &sect;9770; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;177.</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The third sentence of Rule 68 has been altered to make clear that evidence of an unaccepted offer is admissible in a proceeding to determine the costs of the action but is not otherwise admissible.</p>
<p class="note-body">The two sentences substituted for the deleted last sentence of the rule assure a party the right to make a second offer where the situation permits&mdash;as, for example, where a prior offer was not accepted but the plaintiff's judgment is nullified and a new trial ordered, whereupon the defendant desires to make a second offer. It is implicit, however, that as long as the case continues&mdash;whether there be a first, second or third trial&mdash;and the defendant makes no further offer, his first and only offer will operate to save him the costs from the time of that offer if the plaintiff ultimately obtains a judgment less than the sum offered. In the case of successive offers not accepted, the offeror is saved the costs incurred after the making of the offer which was equal to or greater than the judgment ultimately obtained. These provisions should serve to encourage settlements and avoid protracted litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;before the trial begins&rdquo;, in the first sentence of the rule, has been construed in <em>Cover v. Chicago Eye Shield Co</em>. (C.C.A.7th, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 374, cert. den. (1943) 320 U.S. 749.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This logical extension of the concept of offer of judgment is suggested by the common admiralty practice of determining liability before the amount of liability is determined.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
