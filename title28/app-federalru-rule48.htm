<h3 class="section-head">Rule 48. Masters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A court of appeals may appoint a special master to hold hearings, if necessary, and to make recommendations as to factual findings and disposition in matters ancillary to proceedings in the court. Unless the order referring a matter to a master specifies or limits the master's powers, a master shall have power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before the master and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the master's duties under the order including, but not limited to, requiring the production of evidence upon all matters embraced in the reference and putting witnesses and parties on oath and examining them. If the master is not a judge or court employee, the court shall determine the master's compensation and whether the cost will be charged to any of the parties.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The text of the existing Rule 48 concerning the title was moved to Rule 1.</p>
<p class="note-body">This new Rule 48 authorizes a court of appeals to appoint a special master to make recommendations concerning ancillary matters. The courts of appeals have long used masters in contempt proceedings where the issue is compliance with an enforcement order. <em>See Polish National Alliance v. NLRB</em>, 159 F.2d 38 (7th Cir. 1946), <em>NLRB v. Arcade-Sunshine Co</em>., 132 F.2d 8 (D.C. Cir. 1942); <em>NLRB v. Remington Rand, Inc</em>., 130 F.2d 919 (2d Cir. 1942). There are other instances when the question before a court of appeals requires a factual determination. An application for fees or eligibility for Criminal Justice Act status on appeal are examples.</p>
<p class="note-body">Ordinarily when a factual issue is unresolved, a court of appeals remands the case to the district court or <!-- PDFPage:47 -->agency that originally heard the case. It is not the Committee's intent to alter that practice. However, when factual issues arise in the first instance in the court of appeals, such as fees for representation on appeal, it would be useful to have authority to refer such determinations to a master for a recommendation.</p>
