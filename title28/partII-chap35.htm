<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;United States attorney&rdquo; was adopted in this section for &ldquo;attorney for the United States.&rdquo; Since the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in In re Neagle, 1890 (10 S. Ct. 658, 135 U.S. 1, 34, L. Ed. 55) where the terms &ldquo;attorneys of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;district attorneys&rdquo; were used interchangeably, Congress has also designated such officers as either &ldquo;United States attorneys&rdquo; or as &ldquo;district attorneys.&rdquo; See Acts of Feb. 22, 1886, ch. 928, &sect;7, 24 Stat. 309; July 3, 1890, ch. 656, &sect;16, 26 Stat. 217; July 10, 1890, ch. 664, &sect;16, 26 Stat. 225, and Acts of July 20, 1882, ch. 312, &sect;3, 22 Stat. 172; Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 100, &sect;3, 38 Stat. 961; May 28, 1926, ch. 414, &sect;2(b), 44 Stat. 672.</p>
<p class="note-body">At present, such officers are invariably designated as &ldquo;United States attorneys&rdquo; by Federal courts and the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;The President may appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,&rdquo; were inserted to conform section with the Constitution. See article II, section 2, clause 2.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;including the District of Columbia&rdquo; were omitted, because the District is made a judicial district by section 88 of this title. District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., &sect;11&ndash;1001, provided for appointment of an &ldquo;attorney of the United States for the District&rdquo; by the President, subject to Senate confirmation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;learned in the law&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary. Such requirement is not made of United States judges and no reason appears to make a distinction respecting United States attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">Parts of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., remain in said title 48. For remainder thereof, see Distribution Table. Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 504 [now 541 and 544], and 541 [see 561] of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Prior section 504.&mdash;</em>Based on section 315 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;482, and sections 643 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (R.S. &sect;&sect;366, 769; June 24, 1898, ch. 495, &sect;1, 30 Stat. 487; Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, &sect;34, 31 Stat. 85; Apr. 30, 1900, ch. 339, &sect;86, 31 Stat. 158; Mar. 3, 1909, ch. 269, &sect;1, 35 Stat. 838; Jan. 7, 1913, ch. 6, 37 Stat. 648; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, &sect;41, 39 Stat. 965; Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, &sect;1, 41 Stat. 1412; July 9, 1921, ch. 42, &sect;313, 42 Stat. 119; Feb. 12, 1925, ch. 220, 43 Stat. 890; Apr. 17, 1930, ch. 174, 46 Stat. 170; Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, &sect;2, 52 Stat. 118).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates parts of sections 315 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and 643 and 863 of title 48, both U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 482 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. It is recommended that said section 315 be amended so as to omit those provisions relating to special attorneys to assist &ldquo;district attorneys&rdquo; which were used as part of the basis for this section, as other parts of said section 315, relating to special assistants to the Attorney General, and to foreign counsel, are to remain in title 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;United States attorney&rdquo; were substituted for district attorney, and reference to District of Columbia was omitted. (See reviser's note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to the territories in said section 482, was also omitted as covered by provisions of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions. See sections 109 and 112 of such title applicable to United States attorney in Alaska, and 1353 applicable in the Canal Zone, and 1405y applicable in the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision as to the tenure of the assistant United States attorneys and special attorneys is new. Existing law contains no provision as to tenure or removal of such officials. While the Supreme Court has held that the power of removal of executive officials is incident to the power of appointment, this section expressly provides for removal. See <em>Meyers v. United States</em>, 1926 (47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 315 contained a provision that special attorneys appointed to assist United States attorneys should take the same oath required of the latter. This section was extended to assistant United States attorneys, respecting whom no provision existed as to oaths.</p>
<p class="note-body">A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of said section 863, see Distribution Table. Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 501 [now 541], and 541 [see 561] of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision permitting the United States attorney and his assistants to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few Federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein.

The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts supervises the duties of clerks under chapter 41 of this title. The provision for authority of said General Counsel over marshals, also contained in section 329, is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title in which such authority is vested in the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 327 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorized said General Counsel to establish regulations, subject to approval by the Attorney General, to be observed by United States attorneys and marshals in which the United States is a party.

The second clause of said section 317 is covered by subsection (a)(5) of this section. The authority of the Attorney General over marshals and the requirement that they shall report to him the conduct and state of their offices, contained also in said section 317, is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 330 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which required that United States attorneys should conduct, under direction of the General Counsel of the Treasury, all suits and proceedings involving the United States under the laws governing national banking associations is covered by subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">The second paragraph of former section 509 is omitted as it was superseded by the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph was based in part on former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in section 5706 of title 5, United States Code, substantially reenacted former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was repealed by the Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, by which title 28 was originally enacted. The purpose of section 6 was to allow reimbursement for only such actual and necessary travel expenses incurred unless otherwise permitted by the Act of 1949 itself or by laws relating to the military. Section 6 did not, however, provide for the exception of United States attorneys as did former section 73.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1949, which are codified in sections 5701 and 5702 of title 5, United States Code, defined the coverage of the Act and allowed for specific exclusions in the legislative and judicial branches but did not mention an exclusion in the executive branch for United States attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 7 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5707 of title 5, United States Code, expressly vested in the Director of the Bureau of the Budget the authority to prescribe regulations covering travel allowances and the reimbursement of travel expenses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(1), (2) of title 5, United States Code, made specific exclusions from the coverage of the Act, and United States attorneys were not so excluded.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 9 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(3), (4) of title 5, United States Code, modified acts inconsistent with the 1949 Act, and specifically mentioned acts which authorize reimbursement of &ldquo;actual and necessary&rdquo; expenses.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Prior section 509.&mdash;</em>Based on sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;586, 587 and 592 (R.S. &sect;&sect;368, 833, 834; Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 133, &sect;1, 18 Stat. 452; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, &sect;&sect;13, 14, 24, 29 Stat. 183, 186; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, &sect;1, 34 Stat. 1360; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, &sect;1, 35 Stat. 375; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167; July 1, 1918, ch. 113, &sect;1, 40 Stat. 683; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, &sect;1, 41 Stat. 209; Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825, &sect;3, 56 Stat. 1089).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates parts of sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and of sections 586, 587, and 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">First paragraph of this section is from section 587 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which did not apply to Alaska because of the restriction in section 591 of said title 28. However, the latter section has been superseded, in that respect, by subsequent appropriation acts, the latest being act July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title II, 60 Stat. 460, which specifically allows office expenses for United States attorneys in Alaska. This section applies to all United States attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 73 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., allowed only actual traveling expenses to Government employees, except &ldquo;district attorneys,&rdquo; marshals and clerks of courts and their deputies. It has been superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926. See sections 821 et seq. of said title 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">References in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to absence &ldquo;from their respective official residences&rdquo; and to going to and returning from attendance before courts, etc., were omitted as surplusage and covered by the phrase &ldquo;on official business.&rdquo; Language relating to Standardized Government Travel Regulations was also omitted as the reference in this section is to the provision in the Subsistence Expense Act, supra, authorizing those regulations. Verification under oath provision was omitted as covered by section 553 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title which simplifies procedure by requiring payment upon certification by the payee. The penal provisions of title 18 are ample protection against fraud and an oath alone is no deterrent.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the marshals should include such payments in their accounts for auditing and allowance, was omitted as unnecessary. See section 541 et seq. [now section 561 et seq.] of this title and section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to supervise the accounts of &ldquo;district&rdquo; attorneys, marshals, clerks, and other court officers. The language of this section covers that requirement. The provision as to marshals is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Quarterly expense accounts were required of United States attorneys and marshals by section 586 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such provision is omitted as unnecessary in view of this section and section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Further provisions of said section 586 that office expenses of United States attorneys, assistants, and marshals should be allowed under regulations of the Attorney General and verified under oath, are simplified by this section and section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Another provision that accounts therefor should be submitted to, examined by the district court and, when approved by the court then audited and allowed by law, was omitted. The power of the Attorney General is sufficient. The reference to audit and allowance was unnecessary as covered by section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance. Said section 586 applied also to marshals and deputies and those provisions are incorporated in section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception in sections 586 and 591 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the former should not apply in Alaska was omitted as unnecessary. Section 114 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, requires travel expense accounts to be rendered and paid as in other districts.</p>
