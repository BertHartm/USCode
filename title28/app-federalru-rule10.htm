<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Composition of the Record on Appeal.</cap-smallcap> The following items constitute the record on appeal:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the transcript of proceedings, if any; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the district clerk.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>The Transcript of Proceedings.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Appellant's Duty to Order.</em> Within 10 days after filing the notice of appeal or entry of an order disposing of the last timely remaining motion of a type specified in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), <!-- PDFPage:23 -->whichever is later, the appellant must do either of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers necessary, subject to a local rule of the court of appeals and with the following qualifications:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the order must be in writing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the cost of the transcript is to be paid by the United States under the Criminal Justice Act, the order must so state; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the appellant must, within the same period, file a copy of the order with the district clerk; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) file a certificate stating that no transcript will be ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Unsupported Finding or Conclusion.</em> If the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Partial Transcript.</em> Unless the entire transcript is ordered:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the appellant must&mdash;within the 10 days provided in Rule 10(b)(1)&mdash;file a statement of the issues that the appellant intends to present on the appeal and must serve on the appellee a copy of both the order or certificate and the statement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the appellee considers it necessary to have a transcript of other parts of the proceedings, the appellee must, within 10 days after the service of the order or certificate and the statement of the issues, file and serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to be ordered; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) unless within 10 days after service of that designation the appellant has ordered all such parts, and has so notified the appellee, the appellee may within the following 10 days either order the parts or move in the district court for an order requiring the appellant to do so.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Payment.</em> At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Statement of the Evidence When the Proceedings Were Not Recorded or When a Transcript Is Unavailable.</cap-smallcap> If the transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection. The statement must be served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed amendments within 10 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the district court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the district clerk in the record on appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Agreed Statement as the Record on Appeal.</cap-smallcap> In place of the record on appeal as defined in Rule 10(a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the district court a statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the district court. The statement must set forth only those facts averred and proved or sought to be proved that are essential to the courts resolution of the issues. If the statement is truthful, it&mdash;together with any additions that the district court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues on appeal&mdash;must be approved by the district court and must then be certified to the court of appeals as the record on appeal. The district clerk must then send it to the circuit clerk within the time provided by Rule 11. A copy of the agreed statement may be filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 30.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Correction or Modification of the Record.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If any difference arises about whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the district court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by that court and the record conformed accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be certified and forwarded:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on stipulation of the parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by the district court before or after the record has been forwarded; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by the court of appeals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) All other questions as to the form and content of the record must be presented to the court of appeals.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from FRCP 75(a), (b), (c) and (d) and FRCP 76, without change in substance.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendments to Rule 10(b) would require the appellant to place with the reporter a written order for the transcript of proceedings and file a copy with the clerk, and to indicate on the order if the transcript is to be provided under the Criminal Justice Act. If the appellant does not plan to order a transcript of any of the proceedings, he must file a certificate to that effect. These requirements make the appellant's steps in readying the appeal a matter of record and give the district court notice of requests for transcripts at the expense of the United States under the Criminal Justice Act. They are also the third step in giving the court of appeals some control over the production and transmission of the record. See Note to Rules 3(d)(e) above and Rule 11 below.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the event the appellant orders no transcript, or orders a transcript of less than all the proceedings, the procedure under the proposed amended rule remains substantially as before. The appellant must serve on the appellee a copy of his order or in the event no order is placed, of the certificate to that effect, and a statement of the issues he intends to present on appeal, and the appellee may thereupon designate additional parts of the transcript to be included, and upon appellant's refusal to order the additional parts, may either order them himself or seek an order requiring the appellant to order them. The only change proposed in this procedure is to place a 10 day time limit on motions to require the appellant to order the additional portions.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:24 --><p class="note-body">Rule 10(b) is made subject to local rules of the courts of appeals in recognition of the practice in some circuits in some classes of cases, e. g., appeals by indigents in criminal cases after a short trial, of ordering immediate preparation of a complete transcript, thus making compliance with the rule unnecessary.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rules 10(b) and (c) are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical and no substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)</em>. The amendment conforms this rule to amendments made in Rule 4(a)(4) in 1993. The amendments to Rule 4(a)(4) provide that certain postjudgment motions have the effect of suspending a filed notice of appeal until the disposition of the last of such motions. The purpose of this amendment is to suspend the 10-day period for ordering a transcript if a timely postjudgment motion is made and a notice of appeal is suspended under Rule 4(a)(4). The 10-day period set forth in the first sentence of this rule begins to run when the order disposing of the last of such postjudgment motions outstanding is entered.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
