<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;113, 116 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;52, 55, 36 Stat. 1101, 1102).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 113 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 116 of such title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Last sentence of section 113 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to execution on judgments or decrees, was omitted as covered by section 2001 et seq. of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;civil action&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;suit&rdquo; in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words of said section 113, &ldquo;against a single defendant, inhabitant of such State, must be brought in the district where he resides&rdquo; were omitted as covered by section 1391 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words of section 116 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;land or other subject matter of a fixed character&rdquo; were deleted and the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; substituted for flexibility and uniformity. (See sections 754, 1692, of this title and reviser's notes thereunder.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words of said section 116, &ldquo;and the court in which it is brought shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide it, and to cause mesne or final process to be issued and executed, as fully as if the said subject matter were wholly within the district for which such court is constituted&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage and fully covered by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Said rule also covers the following omitted language: &ldquo;A duplicate writ may be issued against the defendants, directed to the marshal of any other district in which any defendant resides.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
