<h3 class="section-head">Rule 83.2. Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement.</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Court of Federal Claims, in furtherance of its inherent power and responsibility to supervise the conduct of attorneys who are admitted to practice before it, or admitted for the purpose of a particular proceeding pursuant to RCFC 83.1(a) and (b)(5), promulgates the following Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement superseding all of its other rules pertaining to disciplinary enforcement heretofore promulgated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Attorneys Convicted of Crimes.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Upon the filing with the court of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction demonstrating that any attorney admitted to practice before the court has been convicted in any court of the United States, or the District of Columbia, or of any state, territory, commonwealth or possession of the United States of a serious crime as hereinafter defined, the court shall enter an order immediately suspending that attorney, whether the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or from a verdict after trial or otherwise, and regardless of the pendency of any appeal, until final disposition of a disciplinary proceeding to be commenced upon such conviction. A copy of such order shall immediately be served upon the attorney. Upon good cause shown, the court may set aside such order when it appears in the interest of justice so to do.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The term serious crime shall include any felony and any lesser crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of such crime in the jurisdiction where the judgment was entered, involves false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, willful failure to file income tax returns, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or an attempt or a conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a serious crime.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> A certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for any crime shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against that attorney based upon the conviction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for a serious crime, the court shall, in addition to suspending that attorney in accordance with the provisions of this rule, refer the matter to counsel for the institution of a disciplinary proceeding before the court in which the sole issue to be determined shall be the extent of the final discipline to be imposed as a result of the conduct resulting in the conviction, provided that a disciplinary proceeding so instituted will not be brought to final hearing until all appeals from the conviction are concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for a crime not constituting a serious crime, the court may refer the matter to counsel for whatever action counsel may deem warranted, including the institution of a disciplinary proceeding before the court; provided, however, that the court may in its discretion make no reference with respect to convictions for minor offenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> An attorney suspended under the provisions of this rule will be reinstated immediately upon the filing of a certificate demonstrating that the underlying conviction of a serious crime has been reversed, but the reinstatement will not terminate any disciplinary proceeding then pending against the attorney, the disposition of which shall be determined by the court on the basis of all available evidence pertaining to both guilt and the extent of discipline to be imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discipline Imposed by Other Courts; Disbarment on Consent or Representation in Other Courts.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court shall, upon being subjected to public discipline by any other court of the United States or District of Columbia, or by a court of any state, territory, commonwealth or possession of the United States, promptly inform the clerk of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court shall, upon being disbarred on consent or resigning from the bar of any other court of the United States or the District of Columbia, or from the bar of any state, territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States while an investigation into allegations of misconduct is pending, promptly inform the clerk of such disbarment on consent or resignation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment or order demonstrating that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been disciplined by another court or upon accepting disbarment on consent or resignation, the court shall forthwith issue a notice directed to the attorney containing: a copy of the judgment or order from the other court or a copy of the communication indicating disbarment on consent or resignation; and an order to show cause directing that the attorney inform the court within 30 days after service of that order upon the attorney, personally or by mail of any claim by the attorney predicated upon the grounds set forth in paragraph (5), and that the imposition of the identical discipline by the court would be unwarranted and the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> In the event the discipline imposed in the other jurisdiction has been stayed there, any <!-- PDFPage:448 -->reciprocal discipline imposed in the court shall be deferred until such stay expires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> Upon the expiration of 30 days from service of the notice issued pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (3), the court shall impose the identical discipline unless the respondent-attorney demonstrates, or the court finds, that upon the face of the record upon which the discipline in another jurisdiction is predicated it clearly appears:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> that the procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> or that there was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that the court could not, consistent with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on that subject;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> or that the imposition of the same discipline by the court would result in grave injustice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> or that the misconduct established is deemed by the court to warrant substantially different discipline.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">Where the court determines that any of said elements exist, it shall enter such other order as it deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> In all other respects, a final adjudication in another court that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct shall establish conclusively the misconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> The court may at any stage appoint counsel to prosecute the disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Standards for Professional Conduct.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> For misconduct defined in this rule and after notice and opportunity to be heard, any attorney admitted to practice before the court may be disbarred, suspended from practice before the court, publicly reprimanded, or subjected to such other disciplinary action as the circumstances may warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Acts or omissions by an attorney admitted to practice before the court, individually or in concert with any other person or persons, which violate the Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by the court shall constitute misconduct and shall be grounds for discipline, whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship. The Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by the court is the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, as amended from time to time by the Association, except as otherwise provided by specific rule of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Disciplinary Proceedings</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> When misconduct or allegations of misconduct which, if substantiated, would warrant discipline on the part of an attorney admitted to practice before the court shall come to the attention of a judge or special master of the court, whether by complaint or otherwise, and the applicable procedure is not otherwise mandated by this rule, the judge or special master shall refer the matter to the chief judge for determination whether the matter should be referred to a disciplinary judge for a formal disciplinary proceeding or the formulation of such other recommendation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Should the disciplinary judge conclude after review that a formal disciplinary proceeding should not be initiated against the respondent-attorney because sufficient evidence is not present, or because there is pending another proceeding against the respondent-attorney the disposition of which in the judgment of the disciplinary judge should be awaited before further action by the court is considered or for any other valid reason, the disciplinary judge shall file with the court a recommendation for disposition of the matter, whether by dismissal, admonition, deferral, or otherwise setting forth the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> To initiate formal disciplinary proceedings, the disciplinary judge shall file an order of the court upon a showing of probable cause requiring the respondent-attorney to show cause within 30 days after service of that order upon that attorney, personally, or by mail, why the attorney should not be disciplined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Upon the respondent-attorney's answer to the order to show cause, if any issue of fact is raised or the respondent-attorney wishes to be heard in mitigation, the disciplinary judge shall set the matter for prompt hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Disbarment on Consent While Under Disciplinary Investigation or Prosecution</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court who is the subject of an investigation into or a pending proceeding involving allegations of misconduct may consent to disbarment, but only by delivering to the court an affidavit stating that the attorney desires to consent to disbarment and that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the attorney's consent is freely and voluntarily rendered; the attorney is not being subjected to coercion or duress; the attorney is fully aware of the implications of so consenting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the attorney is aware that there is a presently pending investigation or proceeding involving allegations that there exist grounds for the attorney's discipline the nature of which the attorney shall specifically set forth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> the attorney acknowledges that the material facts so alleged are true; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> the attorney so consents because the attorney knows that if charges were predicated upon the matters under investigation, or if the proceeding were prosecuted, the attorney could not successfully defend himself.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Upon receipt of the required affidavit, the court shall enter an order disbarring the attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The order disbarring the attorney on consent shall be a matter of public record. However, the affidavit required under the provisions of this rule shall not be publicly disclosed or made available for use in any other proceeding except upon order of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Reinstatement.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) After Disbarment or Suspension.</strong> An attorney suspended for three months or less shall be automatically reinstated at the end of the period of suspension upon the filing with the court of an affidavit of compliance with <!-- PDFPage:449 -->the provisions of the order. An attorney suspended for more than three months or disbarred may not resume practice until reinstated by order of the court, except as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Time of Application Following Disbarment.</strong> A person who has been disbarred after hearing or by consent may not apply for reinstatement until the expiration of at least one year from the effective day of the disbarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Hearing on Application.</strong> Petitions for reinstatement by a disbarred or suspended attorney under this rule shall be filed with the Clerk, and directed to the chief judge of the court. Such petitions shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner has the moral qualifications, competency and learning in the law before the court and that the petitioner's resumption to the practice of law will not be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the bar or to the administration of justice, or subversive of the public interest. Upon receipt of the petition, the chief judge shall promptly assign the petition to one or more judges of the court for prompt action. The judge or judges assigned to the matter shall within 30 days after referral issue an order of reinstatement based upon the petition or, schedule a hearing at which the petitioner shall have the burden of demonstrating the elements listed above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Deposit for Costs of Proceeding.</strong> The court may direct that petitions for reinstatement under this rule shall be accompanied by an advance cost deposit in an amount to be set from time to time by the court to cover anticipated costs of the reinstatement proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Conditions of Reinstatement.</strong> If the petitioner is found unfit to resume the practice of law, the petition shall be dismissed. If the petitioner is found fit to resume the practice of law, the judgment shall reinstate the petitioner, provided that the judgment may make reinstatement conditional upon the payment of all or part of the costs of the proceedings, and upon the making of partial or complete restitution to parties harmed by the petitioner whose conduct led to the suspension or disbarment. Provided further, that if the petitioner has been suspended or disbarred for 5 years or more, reinstatement may be conditioned, in the discretion of the judge or judges before whom the matter is heard, upon the furnishing of proof of competency and learning in law, which proof may include certification by the bar examiners of a state or other jurisdiction of the attorney's successful completion of an examination for admission to practice subsequent to the date of suspension or disbarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Successive Petitions.</strong> No petition for reinstatement under this Appendix shall be filed within one year following an adverse judgment upon a petition for reinstatement filed by or on behalf of the same person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Attorneys Specially Admitted.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an attorney applies to be admitted or is admitted to the court for purposes of a particular proceeding pursuant to RCFC 83.1(a) or(b)(5), the attorney shall be deemed thereby to have conferred disciplinary jurisdiction upon the court for any alleged misconduct of that attorney arising in the course of or in the preparation for such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Service of Papers and Other Notices.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Service of an order to show cause instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding shall be made by personal service or by registered or certified mail addressed to the respondent-attorney at such attorney's last known address. If service by registered or certified mail is ineffective, the court shall enter an order as appropriate to effect service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Service of any other papers or notices required by this rule shall be deemed to have been made if such paper or notice is addressed to the respondent-attorney at such attorney's last known address or the respondent-attorney at the address indicated in the most recent pleading or other document filed in the course of any proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Appointment of Counsel.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The court may appoint as counsel one or more members of the bar of the court to investigate allegations of misconduct or to prosecute disciplinary proceedings under this rule, provided, however, that the respondent-attorney may move to disqualify an attorney so appointed who is or has been engaged as an adversary of the respondent-attorney in any matter. Counsel, once appointed, may not resign unless permission to do so is given by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(j) Payment of Fees and Costs.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">At the conclusion of any disciplinary investigation or prosecution, if any, under this rule, counsel may make application to the court for an order awarding reasonable fees and reimbursing costs expended in the course of such disciplinary investigation or prosecution. Any such order shall be submitted to the clerk who shall pay the amount required thereunder from the funds collected pursuant to subdivision (j).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(k) Duties of the Clerk.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Upon being informed that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been convicted of any crime, the clerk shall determine whether the clerk of the convicting court has forwarded a certificate of such conviction to the court. If a certificate has not been so forwarded, the clerk shall promptly obtain a certificate and file it with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Upon being informed that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been subjected to discipline by another court, the clerk shall determine whether a certified copy of the disciplinary judgment or order has been filed with the court, and, if not, the clerk shall promptly obtain a certified copy of the disciplinary judgment or order and file it with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Whenever it appears that any person disbarred or suspended or censured or disbarred on consent by the court is admitted to practice law in any other jurisdiction or before any other court, the clerk shall, within 10 days of that disbarment, suspension, censure, or disbarment on consent, transmit to the disciplinary authority in such other jurisdiction, or for such other court, a certified copy of the order of disbarment, suspension, censure, or disbarment on consent, as well as the last <!-- PDFPage:450 -->known office and residence address of the defendant or respondent-attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> The clerk shall notify the National Discipline Data Bank operated by the American Bar Association of any order imposing public discipline upon any attorney admitted to practice before the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> The clerk shall utilize a portion of the fee for admission required by RCFC 77.1(c) to defray the payment of fees and costs under subdivision (i) of this rule and any other costs incurred by the administration of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(<em>l</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong>) Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this rule shall be construed to deny to the court such powers as are necessary for the court to maintain control over proceedings conducted before it, such as proceedings for contempt, issuance of public reprimands, or imposition of fines of not more than $1,000.00.</p>

<p class="note-body">Former RCFC 83.2 has been renumbered RCFC 7.1. New RCFC 83.2 formerly appeared in these rules as Appendix F. The incorporation of former Appendix F into the main body of the court's rules reflects a more logical placement of its subject matter in the organizational structure of the court's rules.</p>
