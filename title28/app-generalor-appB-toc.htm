<h3 class="analysis-subhead">I. SCOPE OF RULES; COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS</h3>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 1. Scope of Rules.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">These rules govern all proceedings before the United States Court of Federal Claims pursuant to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program established by 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;300aa&ndash;10 et seq. (1994) (Vaccine Act). These rules govern both proceedings before the Office of Special Masters, as well as any subsequent proceedings before a judge of the Court of Federal Claims. These rules are to be cited as the Vaccine Rules. In all matters not specifically provided for by the Vaccine Rules, the special master or the court may regulate the applicable practice, consistent with these rules and with the purpose of the Vaccine Act, to decide cases promptly and efficiently. In proceedings before the Office of Special Masters, the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC) apply only to the extent referenced in the Vaccine Rules. In proceedings before a judge, the RCFC will apply except to the extent that such rules are inconsistent with the Vaccine Rules.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 3. Role of Special Master&mdash;Generally.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Assignment.</strong> Once a petition has been filed by the clerk, the case shall be assigned by the chief special master to a special master to conduct proceedings in accordance with the Vaccine Rules. All proceedings prior to the issuance of the special master's decision are to be conducted exclusively by the special master.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Duties.</strong> The special master shall be responsible for conducting all proceedings, including requiring such evidence as may be appropriate, in order to prepare a decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining whether an award of compensation should be made under the Vaccine Act and the amount of any such award. The special master shall determine the nature of the proceedings, with the goal of making the proceedings expeditious, flexible, and less adversarial, while at the same time affording each party a full and fair opportunity to present its case and creating a record sufficient to allow review of the special master's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Absence; Reassignment.</strong> In the absence of the special master to whom a case is assigned, the chief special master may act on behalf of the assigned special master, or designate another special master to act. When necessary for the efficient administration of justice, the chief special master may reassign a case to another special master.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 4. Respondent's Review and Report.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Respondent's Review of Completeness of the Records.</strong> Within 30 days of the filing of a petition, respondent shall review the medical and other records to determine whether, in respondent's view, all records necessary to enable respondent to evaluate the merits of the claim have been supplied with the petition. If respondent considers that relevant records are missing, respondent's counsel shall immediately notify petitioner's counsel regarding the perceived omissions. If the parties disagree about the completeness of the records filed or the relevance of requested records, either party may request that the special master resolve the matter. If the special master concludes that records called for by Vaccine Rule 2(e) have not been submitted, the petition may be subject to dismissal, without prejudice, under Vaccine Rule 21(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Respondent's Report.</strong> Within 90 days after the filing of the petition, respondent shall file a report that shall set forth a full and complete statement of respondent's position as to why an award should or should not be granted. The report shall contain respondent's medical analysis of petitioner's claims. It shall also present any legal arguments that respondent may have in opposition to the petition. General denials are not sufficient.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 5. Informal Review and Tentative Findings and Conclusions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The special master shall schedule an off-the-record conference to be held within 30 days of the filing of respondent's report pursuant to Vaccine Rule 4(b). At this conference, after affording the parties an opportunity to address each other's positions, the special master will review the materials submitted, evaluate the respective positions, and orally present tentative findings and conclusions. At the conclusion of this conference, the special master may issue a scheduling order outlining the necessary proceedings for resolving the issues presented in the case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 6. Status Conferences.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The special master shall conduct conferences from time to time in order to expedite the proc<!-- PDFPage:456 -->essing of the case. The conferences will be informal in nature and ordinarily will be conducted by telephone conference call. Either party may request a status conference at any time. At such conferences, counsel for both parties will have the opportunity to propose procedures by which to process the case in the least adversarial, most efficient way possible.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 7. Discovery.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be no discovery as a matter of right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Informal Discovery Preferred.</strong> The informal and cooperative exchange of information is the ordinary and preferred practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Formal Discovery.</strong> If a party considers that informal discovery is not sufficient, that party may seek to utilize the discovery procedures provided by RCFC 26&ndash;37 by filing a motion indicating the discovery sought and stating with particularity the reasons therefor, including an explanation why informal techniques have not been sufficient. Such a motion may also be made orally at a status conference.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Subpoena.</strong> When necessary, the special master upon request by a party may approve the issuance of a subpoena. In so doing, the procedures of RCFC 45 shall apply. See RCFC Appendix of Forms (Form 7A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 8. Taking of Evidence and Argument; Decision.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> The special master in each case, based on the specific circumstances thereof, shall determine the format for taking evidence and hearing argument. The particular format for each case will be ordered after consultation with the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Hearing.</strong> When necessary, the special master may conduct an evidentiary hearing. The special master will determine the format for such a hearing. The special master may permit direct examination of a witness or may permit or require that the direct testimony be submitted in written form. The special master may question a witness and may, on request, permit questioning by opposing counsel. Upon order by the special master, the clerk or counsel may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at such hearing. A transcript of the hearing shall be prepared in conformity with RCFC 80.1 and RCFC Appendix of Forms (Forms 3A and 3B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Evidence.</strong> In receiving evidence, the special master will not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence. The special master will consider all relevant, reliable evidence, governed by principles of fundamental fairness to both parties. Evidence may be taken in the form of documents, affidavits, or oral testimony, which may be given in person or via telephone, videoconference, or videotape. Sworn written testimony may be submitted in lieu of oral testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Decision Without Evidentiary Hearing.</strong> The special master may decide a case on the basis of written filings without an evidentiary hearing. In addition, the special master may decide a case on summary judgment, adopting procedures set forth in RCFC 56 modified to the needs of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Argument.</strong> Argument may be received by telephone conference call or at a hearing or in written submissions. The special master may establish requirements for such filings, <em>e.g.</em>, contents or page limitations, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Waiver of Argument.</strong> Any fact or argument not raised specifically in the record before the special master shall be considered waived and cannot be raised by either party in proceedings on review of a special master's decision. This rule shall not apply to legal arguments raised by the party that stands in the role of the appellee on review.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 9. Suspension of Proceedings.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> On the motion of a party, for good cause shown, the special master may suspend proceedings on the petition. The special master shall grant one such suspension for 30 days on the motion of either party. Further motions by either party for suspension may be granted, totaling not more than 150 additional days, in the special master's discretion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Effect.</strong> Such periods of suspension shall be excluded for purposes of the time limitations of 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;12(d)(3) and Vaccine Rules 4(b) and 10.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 10. Special Master's Decision.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> The special master shall issue a final decision determining whether or not an award of compensation shall be made and, if so, the amount thereof. This decision shall be filed within 240 days of the date on which the petition was filed, exclusive of periods of suspension pursuant to Vaccine Rule 9.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Certain Retrospective Cases.</strong> In cases in which the vaccination in question occurred prior to October 1, 1988, and in which the vaccine recipient is not deceased, the special master shall defer ruling on the limited issue of the amount of any compensation for lost earnings and pain and suffering, 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;15(a)(3) and (4), and combine that ruling with the decision under Vaccine Rule 13.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Reconsideration.</strong> Within 21 days of the issuance of the special master's decision, if neither a judgment nor a motion for review of the special master's decision has yet been filed, either party may file a motion for reconsideration of the special master's decision. The special master may seek the non-moving party's response to such a motion, determining the method of and time schedule for any such response. The special master will not rule in favor of such a motion without first requesting a response to it. The special master shall have discretion to grant or deny such motion, in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) If granted.</strong> If the special master elects to grant the motion for reconsideration, the special master shall do so by filing an order withdrawing the decision in question. The withdrawn decision then becomes void for all purposes, and the special master must subsequently enter a superseding decision. An order withdrawing the decision may be filed only if neither a judgment nor a motion for review has yet been filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) If not granted.</strong> The filing of a motion for reconsideration will not negate the running of the 30-day period for filing a motion for review of the special master's decision. If the special master denies such a motion, or during any period in which the special master has not yet <!-- PDFPage:457 -->acted upon such a motion, the 30-day period for the filing of a motion for review of the special master's decision shall continue to run and either side may file a motion for review.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">III. JUDGMENT AND FURTHER PROCEEDINGS</h3>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 11. Judgment</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) In the Absence of Motion for Review.</strong> In the absence of the filing of a motion for review pursuant to Vaccine Rule 23 within 30 days of the filing of the special master's decision, or if prior to the expiration of such period each party files a notice stating that it will not seek such review, the clerk shall forthwith enter judgment in accordance with the special master's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Stipulation for Judgment.</strong> Any stipulation for a money judgment shall be signed by authorized representatives of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 12. Election.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> When no motion for review of a decision pursuant to Vaccine Rule 10 is filed by either party pursuant to Vaccine Rule 23, petitioner shall, within 90 days after the entry of judgment, file with the clerk an election in writing either (1) to accept the judgment or (2) to file a civil action for damages for the alleged injury or death. Upon failure to file an election within the time prescribed, petitioner shall be deemed to have filed an election to accept the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Declining Award.</strong> An election to decline an award of compensation may be accompanied by a motion for the limited compensation provided by 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;15(f)(2). If such a motion has not been filed by time the election is filed, petitioner will be deemed to have waived that limited compensation. Such motion shall be forwarded to the special master for a decision thereon. The decision of the special master on the motion shall be considered a separate &ldquo;decision&rdquo; for purposes of Vaccine Rules 11, 18, and 23.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 13. Attorneys&rsquo; Fees and Costs.</strong></p>

A transcript prepared pursuant to Vaccine Rule 8(b) shall be considered a filing for purposes of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Decisions of special masters and judges.</strong> When a decision of a special master or of the court is filed with the clerk, each party will be afforded 14 days in which to object to the public disclosure of any information furnished by that party&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> that is trade secret or commercial or financial information and is privileged or confidential, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> that are medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the party furnishing information objects to disclosure, that information shall be redacted prior to public disclosure of the decision. In the absence of objection, the entire decision will be made public.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 20. Motions.</strong></p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Voluntary Dismissal; Effect Thereof.</strong> A petition may be dismissed by the petitioner without order of the special master or the court (1) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service of respondent's report, or (2) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the proceeding. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal may, in the discretion of the special master or the court, be deemed to operate as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a petitioner who has previously dismissed the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure to Prosecute or Participate.</strong> If petitioner fails to prosecute, the petition may be dismissed pursuant to Vaccine Rule 21(c). No judgment shall be entered against respondent despite any failure of participation unless petitioner introduces evidence establishing a right to compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Involuntary Dismissal.</strong> For failure of petitioner to prosecute or comply with the Vaccine Rules or any order, the special master or the court may dismiss a petition or any claim therein.</p>
