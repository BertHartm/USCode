<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>Mandamus or Prohibition to a Court: Petition, Filing, Service, and Docketing.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A party petitioning for a writ of mandamus or prohibition directed to a court shall file a petition with the circuit clerk with proof of service on all parties to the proceeding in the trial court. The party shall also provide a copy to the trial court judge. All parties to the proceeding in the trial court other than the petitioner are respondents for all purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The petition shall be titled &ldquo;In re [name of petitioner].&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The petition shall state:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the relief sought;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the issues presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the facts necessary to understand the issues presented by the petition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the reasons why the writ should issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The petition shall include copies of any order or opinion or parts of the record that may be essential to understand the matters set forth in the petition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Denial; Order Directing Answer; Briefs; Precedence.</em></p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">The authority of courts of appeals to issue extraordinary writs is derived from 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651. Subdivisions (a) and (b) regulate in detail the procedure surrounding the writs most commonly sought&mdash;mandamus or prohibition directed to a judge or judges. Those subdivisions are based upon Supreme Court Rule 31, with certain changes which reflect the uniform practice among the circuits (Seventh Circuit Rule 19 is a typical circuit rule). Subdivision (c) sets out a very general procedure to be followed in applications for the variety of other writs which may be issued under the authority of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1651.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The amendment makes it clear that a court may require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In most instances, a writ of mandamus or prohibition is not actually directed to a judge in any more personal way than is an order reversing a court's judgment. Most often a petition for a writ of mandamus seeks review of the intrinsic merits of a judge's action and is in reality an adversary proceeding between the parties. See, <em>e.g., Walker v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc</em>., 443 F.2d 33 (7th Cir. 1971). In order to change the tone of the rule and of mandamus proceedings generally, the rule is amended so that the judge is not treated as a respondent. The caption and subdivision (a) are amended by deleting the reference to the writs as being &ldquo;directed to a judge or judges.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:25 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Subdivision (a) applies to writs of mandamus or prohibition directed to a court, but it is amended so that a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition does not bear the name of the judge. The amendments to subdivision (a) speak, however, about mandamus or prohibition &ldquo;directed to a court.&rdquo; This language is inserted to distinguish subdivision (a) from subdivision (c). Subdivision (c) governs all other extraordinary writs, including a writ of mandamus or prohibition directed to an administrative agency rather than to a court and a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments require the petitioner to provide a copy of the petition to the trial court judge. This will alert the judge to the filing of the petition. This is necessary because the trial court judge is not treated as a respondent and, as a result, is not served. A companion amendment is made in subdivision (b). It requires the circuit clerk to send a copy of the disposition of the petition to the trial court judge.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The amendment provides that even if relief is requested of a particular judge, although the judge may request permission to respond, the judge may not do so unless the court invites or orders a response.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court of appeals ordinarily will be adequately informed not only by the opinions or statements made by the trial court judge contemporaneously with the entry of the challenged order but also by the arguments made on behalf of the party opposing the relief. The latter does not create an attorney-client relationship between the party's attorney and the judge whose action is challenged, nor does it give rise to any right to compensation from the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court of appeals desires to hear from the trial court judge, however, the court may invite or order the judge to respond. In some instances, especially those involving court administration or the failure of a judge to act, it may be that no one other than the judge can provide a thorough explanation of the matters at issue. Because it is ordinarily undesirable to place the trial court judge, even temporarily, in an adversarial posture with a litigant, the rule permits a court of appeals to invite an <em>amicus curiae</em> to provide a response to the petition. In those instances in which the respondent does not oppose issuance of the writ or does not have sufficient perspective on the issue to provide an adequate response, participation of an <em>amicus</em> may avoid the need for the trial judge to participate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The changes are stylistic only. No substantive changes are intended.</p>
