<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;41(1) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;24, par. 1, 36 Stat. 1091; May 14, 1934, ch. 283, &sect;1, 48 Stat. 775; Aug. 21, 1937, ch. 726, &sect;1, 50 Stat. 738; Apr. 20, 1940, ch. 117, 54 Stat. 143).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1331, 1341, 1342, 1345, 1354, and 1359 of this title. (See reviser's notes under said sections.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Jurisdiction conferred by other sections of this chapter, except section 1335, is not dependent upon diversity of citizenship. (See annotations under former section 41 of title 28, U.S.C.A., and 35 C.J.S., p. 833 et seq. &sect;&sect;30&ndash;43. See, also, reviser's note under section 1331 of this title.) As to citizenship of bank where jurisdiction depends upon diversity of citizenship, see section 1348 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;all civil actions&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity&rdquo; in order to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or citizens of the District of Columbia, Territory of Hawaii, or Alaska, and any State or Territory&rdquo; which were inserted by the amendatory act April 20, 1940, are omitted. The word &ldquo;States&rdquo; is defined in this section and enumeration of the references is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section conforms with the views of Philip F. Herrick, United States Attorney, Puerto Rico, who observed that the act of April 20, 1940, permitted action between a citizen of Hawaii and of Puerto Rico, but not between a citizen of New York and Puerto Rico, in the district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">This changes the law to insure uniformity. The 1940 amendment applied only to the provision as to controversies between &ldquo;citizens of different States.&rdquo; The new definition in subsection (b) extends the 1940 amendment to apply to controversies between citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">The diversity of citizenship language of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as amended in 1940, was described as ambiguous in <em>McGarry v. City of Bethlehem</em>, 45 F.Supp. 385, 386. In that case the 1940 amendment was held unconstitutional insofar as it affected the District of Columbia. However, two other district courts upheld the amendment. <em>Winkler v. Daniels</em>, D.C.Va. 1942, 43 F.Supp. 265; <em>Glaeser v. Acacia Mutual Life Ass'n</em>., D.C.Cal. 1944, 55 F.Supp. 925.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section is intended to cover all diversity of citizenship instances in civil actions in accordance with the judicial construction of the language in the original section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Therefore, the revised language covers civil actions between&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State, and citizens of other States and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a Territory or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of different States;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of different Territories;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State, and citizens of Territories;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State or Territory, and citizens of the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="note-body">Citizens of a State, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section removes an uncertainty referred to in the McGarry case, supra, as to whether Congress intended to permit citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia to sue a State or Territory itself rather than the citizens thereof. The court observed that &ldquo;Congress could hardly have had such intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The sentence &ldquo;The foregoing provisions as to the sum or value of the matter in controversy shall not be construed to apply to any of the cases mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs of this section&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary. Those paragraphs are (2)&ndash;(28) of said section 41 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which are revised and incorporated in this chapter and, except for those relating to actions against the United States and interpleader, contains no provision as to a sum or value necessary to confer jurisdiction. Consequently the omitted sentence is covered by excluding such requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as originally enacted, purported to include all jurisdictional provisions relating to the district courts. Subsequently, many special jurisdictional provisions were enacted and incorporated in other titles of the U.S.C., 1940 ed., as follows:</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;41(20), 931(a), 932 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;24, par. 20, 36 Stat. 1093; Nov. 23, 1921, ch. 136, &sect;1310(c), 42 Stat. 311; June 2, 1924, ch. 234, &sect;1025(c), 43 Stat. 348; Feb. 24, 1925, ch. 309, 43 Stat. 972; Feb. 26, 1926, ch. 27, &sect;&sect;1122(c), 1200, 44 Stat. 121, 125; Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753, &sect;&sect;410(a), 411, 60 Stat. 843).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates provisions of section 41(20) conferring jurisdiction upon the district court, in civil actions against the United States, with the first sentence of section 931(a) relating to jurisdiction of the district courts in tort claims cases, and those provisions of section 932 making the provisions of said section 41(20), relating to counterclaim and set-off, applicable to tort claims cases, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision in section 931(a) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for trials without a jury, is incorporated in section 2402 of this revised title. For other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;commencing an action under this section&rdquo; in subsec. (c) of this revised section cover the provision in section 932 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that the same provisions &ldquo;for counterclaim and set-off&rdquo; shall apply to tort claims cases brought in the district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase in section 931(a) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;accruing on and after January 1, 1945&rdquo; was omitted because executed as of the date of the enactment of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to time for commencing action against United States and jury trial constitute sections 2401 and 2402 of this title. (See reviser's notes under said sections.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;commenced after passage of the Revenue Act of 1921&rdquo; were not included in revised subsection (a)(1) because obsolete and superfluous. Actions under this section involving erroneous or illegal assessments by the collector of taxes would be barred unless filed within the 5-year limitation period of section 1113(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 116. (See <em>United States v. A. S. Kreider Co</em>., 1941, 61 S.Ct. 1007, 313 U.S. 443, 85 L.Ed. 1447.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;if the collector of internal revenue is dead or is not in office at the time such action or proceeding is commenced&rdquo; were omitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section retains the language of section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to actions against the United States if the collector is dead or not in office when action is commenced, and consequently maintains the long existing distinctions in practice between actions against the United States and actions against the collector who made the assessment or collection. In the latter class of actions either party may demand a jury trial while jury trial is denied in actions against the United States. See section 2402 of this title. In reality all such actions are against the United States and not against local collectors. (See <em>Lowe v. United States</em>, 1938, 58 S.Ct. 896, 304 U.S. 302, 82 L.Ed. 1362; <em>Manseau v. United States</em>, D.C.Mich. 1943, 52 F.Supp. 395, and <em>Combined Metals Reduction Co. v. United States</em>, D.C.Utah 1943, 53 F.Supp. 739.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised subsection (c)(1) omitted clause: &ldquo;but no suit pending on the 27th day of June 1898 shall abate or be affected by this provision,&rdquo; contained in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as obsolete and superfluous. The words contained in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;claims growing out of the Civil War, <!-- PDFPage:326 -->and commonly known as &lsquo;war-claims,&rsquo; or to hear and determine other claims which had been reported adversely prior to the 3d day of March 1887 by any court, department, or commission authorized to have and determine the same,&rdquo; were omitted for the same reason.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;in a civil action or in admiralty,&rdquo; in subsection (a)(2), were substituted for &ldquo;either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty&rdquo; to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words in section 41(20) &ldquo;in respect to which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable&rdquo; were omitted from subsection (a)(2) of this revised section as unnecessary. See reviser's note under section 1491 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">For jurisdiction of The Tax Court to review claims for refunds of processing taxes collected under the unconstitutional Agriculture Adjustment Act, see sections 644&ndash;659 of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and the 1942 Revenue Act, Act Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 610, title V, &sect;510(a), (c), (d), 56 Stat. 667. (See, also, <em>Lamborn v. United States</em>, C.C.P.A. 1939, 104 F.2d 75, certiorari denied 60 S.Ct. 115, 308 U.S. 589, 84 L.Ed. 493.)</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. &sect;&sect;41(1) and 80 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;24(1), 37, 36 Stat. 1091, 1098; May 14, 1934, ch. 283, &sect;1, 48 Stat. 775; Aug. 21, 1937, ch. 726, &sect;1, 50 Stat. 738; Apr. 20, 1940, ch. 117, 54 Stat. 143).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1331, 1332, 1341, 1342, 1345, and 1354 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of costs upon dismissal of an action for lack of jurisdiction are incorporated in section 1919 of this title. Other provisions of said section 80 appear in section 1447 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for dismissal of an action not really and substantially involving a dispute or controversy within the jurisdiction of a district court, were omitted as unnecessary. Any court will dismiss a case not within its jurisdiction when its attention is drawn to the fact, or even on its own motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assignee clause in section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &ldquo;is a jumble of legislative jargon.&rdquo; (For further references to the consequences of &ldquo;its obscure phraseology,&rdquo; see, 35 Ill. Law Rev., January 1941, pp. 569&ndash;571.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section changes this clause by confining its application to cases wherein the assignment is improperly or collusively made to invoke jurisdiction. Furthermore, the difficulty of applying the original clause is overcome and the original purpose of such clause is better served by substantially following section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assignee clause was incorporated in the original Judiciary Act of 1789. Such section 80 was enacted in 1875. The history of the assignee clause &ldquo;shows clearly that its purpose and effect, at the time of its enactment were to prevent the conferring of jurisdiction on the Federal courts, on grounds of diversity of citizenship, by assignment, in cases where it would not otherwise exist.&rdquo; (<em>Sowell v. Federal Reserve Bank</em>, 1925, 45 S.Ct. 528, 529, 268 U.S. 449, 453, 69 L.Ed. 1041, 1048.) Thus the purpose of the assignee clause was to prevent the manufacture of Federal jurisdiction by the device of assignment. It achieves this purpose only partially. For example, the assignee clause excepts two types of choses in action from its coverage: (1) Foreign bill of exchange; and (2) corporate bearer paper. But this does not prevent the use of assignment of these choses in action to create the necessary diversity or alienage for jurisdictional purposes. Such section 80 does, however, prevent that. (See <em>Bullard v. City of Cisco</em>, 1933, 54 S.Ct. 177, 290 U.S. 179, 78 L.Ed. 254, 93 A.L.R. 141.) Its coverage against collusive jurisdiction is unlimited, and its approach is direct. The assignee clause, on the other hand, prevents the bona fide assignee of a chose in action within its terms from resorting to the Federal courts unless there is jurisdiction to support the assignee-plaintiff's case and a showing that there would have been jurisdiction if the assignor had brought the action in lieu of the assignee-plaintiff. Since the assignee clause deals with the bona fide assignee, there has been much litigation to determine the assignments which should or should not be within the purview of the clause. Thus the courts have thought it advisable to limit the term &ldquo;chose in action&rdquo; and exclude from its scope (1) an implied in law duty or promise, and (2) a transfer of a property interest; and to exclude an assignment by operation of law from the coverage of the clause. Intermediate assignments and reassignment also give difficulty.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:335 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a), and for any other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) As used in this section, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.</p>
