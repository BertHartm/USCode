<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Commission, by affirmative vote of at least four members of the Commission, and pursuant to its rules and regulations and consistent with all pertinent provisions of any Federal statute shall promulgate and distribute to all courts of the United States and to the United States Probation System&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) guidelines, as described in this section, for use of a sentencing court in determining the sentence to be imposed in a criminal case, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a determination as to the appropriate amount of a fine or the appropriate length of a term of probation or a term of imprisonment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a determination whether a sentence to a term of imprisonment should include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment, and, if so, the appropriate length of such a term;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a determination whether multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a determination under paragraphs (6) and (11)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#994_1_target" name="994_1">1</a></sup> of section 3563(b) of title 18;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) general policy statements regarding application of the guidelines or any other aspect of sentencing or sentence implementation that in the view of the Commission would further the purposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code, including the appropriate use of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the fine imposition provisions set forth in section 3572 of title 18;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission, in the guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1), shall, for each category of offense involving each category of defendant, establish a sentencing range that is consistent with all pertinent provisions of title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a sentence specified by the guidelines includes a term of imprisonment, the maximum of <!-- PDFPage:310 -->the range established for such a term shall not exceed the minimum of that range by more than the greater of 25 percent or 6 months, except that, if the minimum term of the range is 30 years or more, the maximum may be life imprisonment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission, in establishing categories of offenses for use in the guidelines and policy statements governing the imposition of sentences of probation, a fine, or imprisonment, governing the imposition of other authorized sanctions, governing the size of a fine or the length of a term of probation, imprisonment, or supervised release, and governing the conditions of probation, supervised release, or imprisonment, shall consider whether the following matters, among others, have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents&nbsp;<sup><a href="#994_2_target" name="994_2">2</a></sup> of an appropriate sentence, and shall take them into account only to the extent that they do have relevance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the grade of the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the circumstances under which the offense was committed which mitigate or aggravate the seriousness of the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the nature and degree of the harm caused by the offense, including whether it involved property, irreplaceable property, a person, a number of persons, or a breach of public trust;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the community view of the gravity of the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the public concern generated by the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the deterrent effect a particular sentence may have on the commission of the offense by others; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the current incidence of the offense in the community and in the Nation as a whole.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission in establishing categories of defendants for use in the guidelines and policy statements governing the imposition of sentences of probation, a fine, or imprisonment, governing the imposition of other authorized sanctions, governing the size of a fine or the length of a term of probation, imprisonment, or supervised release, and governing the conditions of probation, supervised release, or imprisonment, shall consider whether the following matters, among others, with respect to a defendant, have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents&nbsp;<sup><a href="#994_2_target" name="994_2">2</a></sup> of an appropriate sentence, and shall take them into account only to the extent that they do have relevance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) age;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) vocational skills;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) mental and emotional condition to the extent that such condition mitigates the defendant's culpability or to the extent that such condition is otherwise plainly relevant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) physical condition, including drug dependence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) previous employment record;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) family ties and responsibilities;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) criminal history; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) degree of dependence upon criminal activity for a livelihood.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall assure that the guidelines and policy statements are entirely neutral as to the race, sex, national origin, creed, and socioeconomic status of offenders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines and policy statements, in recommending a term of imprisonment or length of a term of imprisonment, reflect the general inappropriateness of considering the education, vocational skills, employment record, family ties and responsibilities, and community ties of the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), shall promote the purposes set forth in section 991(b)(1), with particular attention to the requirements of subsection 991(b)(1)(B) for providing certainty and fairness in sentencing and reducing unwarranted sentence disparities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1) to meet the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code, shall take into account the nature and capacity of the penal, correctional, and other facilities and services available, and shall make recommendations concerning any change or expansion in the nature or capacity of such facilities and services that might become necessary as a result of the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The sentencing guidelines prescribed under this chapter shall be formulated to minimize the likelihood that the Federal prison population will exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons, as determined by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants in which the defendant is eighteen years old or older and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has been convicted of a felony that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a crime of violence; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and 959), and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901 et seq.); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has previously been convicted of two or more prior felonies, each of which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a crime of violence; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and 959), and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901 et seq.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment for categories of defendants in which the defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has a history of two or more prior Federal, State, or local felony convictions for offenses committed on different occasions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) committed the offense as part of a pattern of criminal conduct from which the de<!-- PDFPage:311 -->fendant derived a substantial portion of the defendant's income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) committed the offense in furtherance of a conspiracy with three or more persons engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity in which the defendant participated in a managerial or supervisory capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) committed a crime of violence that constitutes a felony while on release pending trial, sentence, or appeal from a Federal, State, or local felony for which he was ultimately convicted; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) committed a felony that is set forth in section 401 or 1010 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 841 and 960), and that involved trafficking in a substantial quantity of a controlled substance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense, and the general appropriateness of imposing a term of imprisonment on a person convicted of a crime of violence that results in serious bodily injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1) reflect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the appropriateness of imposing an incremental penalty for each offense in a case in which a defendant is convicted of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) multiple offenses committed in the same course of conduct that result in the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over one or more of the offenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) multiple offenses committed at different times, including those cases in which the subsequent offense is a violation of section 3146 (penalty for failure to appear) or is committed while the person is released pursuant to the provisions of section 3147 (penalty for an offense committed while on release) of title 18; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the general inappropriateness of imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense of conspiring to commit an offense or soliciting commission of an offense and for an offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(m) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the fact that, in many cases, current sentences do not accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense. This will require that, as a starting point in its development of the initial sets of guidelines for particular categories of cases, the Commission ascertain the average sentences imposed in such categories of cases prior to the creation of the Commission, and in cases involving sentences to terms of imprisonment, the length of such terms actually served. The Commission shall not be bound by such average sentences, and shall independently develop a sentencing range that is consistent with the purposes of sentencing described in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) The Commission periodically shall review and revise, in consideration of comments and data coming to its attention, the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section. In fulfilling its duties and in exercising its powers, the Commission shall consult with authorities on, and individual and institutional representatives of, various aspects of the Federal criminal justice system. The United States Probation System, the Bureau of Prisons, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice, and a representative of the Federal Public Defenders shall submit to the Commission any observations, comments, or questions pertinent to the work of the Commission whenever they believe such communication would be useful, and shall, at least annually, submit to the Commission a written report commenting on the operation of the Commission's guidelines, suggesting changes in the guidelines that appear to be warranted, and otherwise assessing the Commission's work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(p) The Commission, at or after the beginning of a regular session of Congress, but not later than the first day of May, may promulgate under subsection (a) of this section and submit to Congress amendments to the guidelines and modifications to previously submitted amendments that have not taken effect, including modifications to the effective dates of such amendments. Such an amendment or modification shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor and shall take effect on a date specified by the Commission, which shall be no earlier than 180 days after being so submitted and no later than the first day of November of the calendar year in which the amendment or modification is submitted, except to the extent that the effective date is revised or the amendment is otherwise modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(q) The Commission and the Bureau of Prisons shall submit to Congress an analysis and recommendations concerning maximum utilization of resources to deal effectively with the Federal prison population. Such report shall be based upon consideration of a variety of alternatives, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) modernization of existing facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inmate classification and periodic review of such classification for use in placing inmates in the least restrictive facility necessary to ensure adequate security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) use of existing Federal facilities, such as those currently within military jurisdiction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(r) The Commission, not later than two years after the initial set of sentencing guidelines pro<!-- PDFPage:312 -->mulgated under subsection (a) goes into effect, and thereafter whenever it finds it advisable, shall recommend to the Congress that it raise or lower the grades, or otherwise modify the maximum penalties, of those offenses for which such an adjustment appears appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(s) The Commission shall give due consideration to any petition filed by a defendant requesting modification of the guidelines utilized in the sentencing of such defendant, on the basis of changed circumstances unrelated to the defendant, including changes in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the community view of the gravity of the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public concern generated by the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the deterrent effect particular sentences may have on the commission of the offense by others.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(t) The Commission, in promulgating general policy statements regarding the sentencing modification provisions in section 3582(c)(1)(A) of title 18, shall describe what should be considered extraordinary and compelling reasons for sentence reduction, including the criteria to be applied and a list of specific examples. Rehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(u) If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The Commission shall ensure that the general policy statements promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(2) include a policy limiting consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense involving a violation of a general prohibition and for an offense involving a violation of a specific prohibition encompassed within the general prohibition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(w)(1) The Chief Judge of each district court shall ensure that, within 30 days following entry of judgment in every criminal case, the sentencing court submits to the Commission a written report of the sentence, the offense for which it is imposed, the age, race, sex of the offender, and information regarding factors made relevant by the guidelines. The report shall also include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the judgment and commitment order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the statement of reasons for the sentence imposed (which shall include the reason for any departure from the otherwise applicable guideline range);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any plea agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the indictment or other charging document;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the presentence report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) any other information as the Commission finds appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, upon request, make available to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, the written reports and all underlying records accompanying those reports described in this section, as well as other records received from courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall submit to Congress at least annually an analysis of these documents, any recommendations for legislation that the Commission concludes is warranted by that analysis, and an accounting of those districts that the Commission believes have not submitted the appropriate information and documents required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall make available to the Attorney General, upon request, such data files as the Commission may assemble or maintain in electronic form that include any information submitted under paragraph (1). Such data files shall be made available in electronic form and shall include all data fields requested, including the identity of the sentencing judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(x) The provisions of section 553 of title 5, relating to publication in the Federal Register and public hearing procedure, shall apply to the promulgation of guidelines pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(y) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), may include, as a component of a fine, the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation sentence that is ordered.</p>
