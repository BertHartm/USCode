<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. While exercised more frequently in criminal than in civil cases, the authority of the judge to call witnesses is well established. McCormick &sect;8, p. 14; Maguire, Weinstein, et al., Cases on Evidence 303&ndash;304 (5th ed. 1965); 9 Wigmore &sect;2484. One reason for the practice, the old rule against impeaching one's own witness, no longer exists by virtue of Rule 607, <em>supra</em>. Other reasons remain, however, to justify the continuation of the practice of calling court's witnesses. The right to cross-examine, with all it implies, is assured. The tendency of juries to associate a witness with the party calling him, regardless of technical aspects of vouching, is avoided. And the judge is not imprisoned within the case as made by the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The authority of the judge to question witnesses is also well established. McCormick &sect;8, pp. 12&ndash;13; Maguire, Weinstein, et al., Cases on Evidence 737&ndash;739 (5th ed. 1965); 3 Wigmore &sect;784. The authority is, of course, abused when the judge abandons his proper role and assumes that of advocate, but the manner in which interrogation should be conducted and the proper extent of its exercise are not susceptible of formulation in a rule. The omission in no sense precludes courts of review from continuing to reverse for abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The provision relating to objections is designed to relieve counsel of the embarrassment attendant upon objecting to questions by the judge in the presence of the jury, while at the same time assuring that objections are made in apt time to afford the opportunity to take possible corrective measures. Compare the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; objection feature of Rule 605 when the judge is called as a witness.</p>
