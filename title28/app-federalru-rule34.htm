<h3 class="section-head">Rule 34. Oral Argument</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>In general; local rule</em>.&mdash;Oral argument shall be allowed in all cases unless pursuant to local rule a panel of three judges, after examination of the briefs and record, shall be unanimously of the opinion that oral argument is not needed. Any such local rule shall provide any party with an opportunity to file a statement setting forth the reasons why oral argument should be heard. A general statement of the criteria employed in the administration of such local rule shall be published in or with the rule and such criteria shall conform substantially to the following minimum standard:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Oral argument will be allowed unless</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the appeal is frivolous; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the dispositive issue or set of issues has been recently authoritatively decided; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Notice of argument; postponement</em>.&mdash;The clerk shall advise all parties whether oral argument is to be heard, and if so, of the time and place therefor, and the time to be allowed each side. A request for postponement of the argument or for allowance of additional time must be made by motion filed reasonably in advance of the date fixed for hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <em>Order and Content of Argument</em>.&mdash;The appellant is entitled to open and conclude the argument. Counsel may not read at length from briefs, records, or authorities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <em>Cross and separate appeals</em>.&mdash;A cross or separate appeal shall be argued with the initial appeal at a single argument, unless the court otherwise directs. If a case involves a cross appeal, the party who first files a notice of appeal, or in the event that the notices are filed on the same day the plaintiff in the proceeding below, shall be deemed the appellant for the purpose of this rule unless the parties otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. If separate appellants support the same argument, care shall be taken to avoid duplication of argument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <em>Non-appearance of parties</em>.&mdash;If the appellee fails to appear to present argument, the court will hear argument on behalf of the appellant, if present. If the appellant fails to appear, the court may hear argument on behalf of the appellee, if present. If neither party appears, the case will be decided on the briefs unless the court shall otherwise order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <em>Submission on briefs</em>.&mdash;By agreement of the parties, a case may be submitted for decision on the briefs, but the court may direct that the case be argued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <em>Use of physical exhibits at argument; removal</em>.&mdash;If physical exhibits other than docu<!-- PDFPage:39 -->ments are to be used at the argument, counsel shall arrange to have them placed in the court room before the court convenes on the date of the argument. After the argument counsel shall cause the exhibits to be removed from the court room unless the court otherwise directs. If exhibits are not reclaimed by counsel within a reasonable time after notice is given by the clerk, they shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the clerk shall think best.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">A majority of circuits now limit oral argument to thirty minutes for each side, with the provision that additional time may be made available upon request. The Committee is of the view that thirty minutes to each side is sufficient in most cases, but that where additional time is necessary it should be freely granted on a proper showing of cause therefor. It further feels that the matter of time should be left ultimately to each court of appeals, subject to the spirit of the rule that a reasonable time should be allowed for argument. The term &ldquo;side&rdquo; is used to indicate that the time allowed by the rule is afforded to opposing interests rather than to individual parties. Thus if multiple appellants or appellees have a common interest, they constitute only a single side. If counsel for multiple parties who constitute a single side feel that additional time is necessary, they may request it. In other particulars this rule follows the usual practice among the circuits. See 3d Cir. Rule 31; 6th Cir. Rule 20; 10th Cir. Rule 23.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment, patterned after the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, Structure and Internal Procedures: Recommendations for Change, 1975, created by Public Law 489 of the 92nd Cong. 2nd Sess., 86 Stat. 807, sets forth general principles and minimum standards to be observed in formulating any local rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rules 34(a) and (e) are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The amendment of subdivision (d) conforms this rule with the amendment of Rule 28(h).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c</em>). The amendment deletes the requirement that the opening argument must include a fair statement of the case. The Committee proposed the change because in some circuits the court does not want appellants to give such statements. In those circuits, the rule is not followed and is misleading. Nevertheless, the Committee does not want the deletion of the requirement to indicate disapproval of the practice. Those circuits that desire a statement of the case may continue the practice.</p>
