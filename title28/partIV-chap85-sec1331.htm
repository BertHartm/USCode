<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs,&rdquo; were added to conform to rulings of the Supreme Court.

Sayward</em>, 16 S.Ct. 371, 160 U.S. 493, 40 L.Ed. 508; <em>Fishback v. Western Union Tel. Co</em>., 16 S.Ct. 506, 161 U.S. 96, 40 L.Ed. 630; and <em>Halt v.

<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or treaties&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;or treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority,&rdquo; for purposes of brevity.</p>
<p class="note-body">The remaining provisions of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1332, 1341, 1342, 1345, 1354, and 1359 of this title.</p>
