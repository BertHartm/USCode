<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;451, 452, 453 (R.S. &sect;&sect;751, 752, 753; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, &sect;6, 43 Stat. 940).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 451, 452 and 453 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect the consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of restraint of liberty&rdquo; in section 452 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as merely descriptive of the writ.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) was added to give statutory sanction to orderly and appropriate procedure. A circuit judge who unnecessarily entertains applications which should be addressed to the district court, thereby disqualifies himself to hear such matters on appeal and to that extent limits his usefulness as a judge of the court of appeals. The Supreme Court and Supreme Court Justices should not be burdened with applications for writs cognizable in the district courts.</p>
