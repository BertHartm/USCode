<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">When the parties consent to a trial before a magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(1), any appeal from the judgment must be heard by the court of appeals in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(3), unless the parties consent to an appeal on the record to a district judge and thereafter, by petition only, to the court of appeals, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(4). An appeal under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(3) must be taken in identical fashion as an appeal from any other judgment of the district court.</p>
