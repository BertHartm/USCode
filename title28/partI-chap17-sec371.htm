<p class="statutory-body">(d) The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a successor to a justice or judge who retires under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In order to continue receiving the salary of the office under subsection (b), a justice must be certified in each calendar year by the Chief Justice, and a judge must be certified by the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits, as having met the requirements set forth in at least one of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The justice or judge must have carried in the preceding calendar year a caseload involving courtroom participation which is equal to or greater than the amount of work involving courtroom participation which an average judge in active service would perform in three months. In the instance of a justice or judge who has sat on both district courts and courts of appeals, the caseload of appellate work and trial work shall be determined separately and the results of those determinations added together for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The justice or judge performed in the preceding calendar year substantial judicial duties not involving courtroom participation under subparagraph (A), including settlement efforts, motion decisions, writing opinions in cases that have not been orally argued, and administrative duties for the court to which the justice or judge is assigned. Any certification under this subparagraph shall include a statement describing in detail the nature and amount of work and certifying that the work done is equal to or greater than the work described in this subparagraph which an average judge in active service would perform in three months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed work described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in an amount which, when calculated in accordance with such subparagraphs, in the aggregate equals at least 3 months work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed substantial administrative duties directly related to the operation of the courts, or has performed substantial duties for a Federal or State governmental entity. A certification under this subparagraph shall specify that the work done is equal to the full-time work of an employee of the judicial branch. In any year in which a justice or judge performs work described under this subparagraph for less than the full year, one-half of such work may be aggregated with work described under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph for the purpose of the justice or judge satisfying the requirements of such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The justice or judge was unable in the preceding calendar year to perform judicial or administrative work to the extent required by any of subparagraphs (A) through (D) because of a temporary or permanent disability. A certification under this subparagraph shall be made to a justice who certifies in writing his or her disability to the Chief Justice, and to a judge who certifies in writing his or her disability to the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits. A justice or judge who is certified under this subparagraph as having a permanent disability shall be deemed to have met the requirements of this subsection for each calendar year thereafter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Determinations of work performed under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) shall be made pursuant to rules promulgated <!-- PDFPage:113 -->by the Judicial Conference of the United States. In promulgating such criteria, the Judicial Conference shall take into account existing standards promulgated by the Conference for allocation of space and staff for senior judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If in any year a justice or judge who retires under subsection (b) does not receive a certification under this subsection (except as provided in paragraph (1)(E)), he or she may thereafter receive a certification for that year by satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in a subsequent year and attributing a sufficient part of the work performed in such subsequent year to the earlier year so that the work so attributed, when added to the work performed during such earlier year, satisfies the requirements for certification for that year. However, a justice or judge may not receive credit for the same work for purposes of certification for more than 1 year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of any justice or judge who retires under subsection (b) during a calendar year, there shall be included in the determination under this subsection of work performed during that calendar year all work performed by that justice or judge (as described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1)) during that calendar year before such retirement.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;375 and 375a (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;260, 36 Stat. 1161; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, &sect;6, 40 Stat. 1157; Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 419, 45 Stat. 1422; Mar. 1, 1937, ch. 21, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 50 Stat. 24; Feb. 11, 1938, ch. 25, &sect;1, 52 Stat. 28; May 11, 1944, ch. 192, &sect;1, 58 Stat. 218).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates provisions of sections 375 and 375a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to resignation and retirement. Remaining provisions of said section 375 now appear in sections 136, 294, and 756 of this title, and remaining provisions of said section 375a now appear in section 294 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;may resign, or may retain his office but retire from regular active service&rdquo; were used to clarify the difference between resignation and retirement. Resignation results in loss of the judge's office, while retirement does not. (<em>Booth v. U.S</em>., 1933, 54 S. Ct. 379, 291 U.S. 339, 78 L. Ed. 836; <em>U.S. v. Moore</em>, 1939, 101 F. 2d 56, certiorari denied 59 S. Ct. 788, 306 U.S. 664, 83 L. Ed. 1060.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Terms &ldquo;judge of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;justice of the United States&rdquo; are defined in section 451 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section continues the provision respecting the salary of a resigned judge but changes such provision for retired judges and makes them eligible to receive any increases provided by Congress for the office from which they retired. This change is in harmony with the clear line of distinction drawn by Congress between retirement and resignation.</p>
