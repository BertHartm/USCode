<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Persons Required to Be Joined if Feasible.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Required Party.</em> A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Joinder by Court Order.</em> If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Venue.</em> If a joined party objects to venue and the joinder would make venue improper, the court must dismiss that party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>When Joinder Is Not Feasible.</cap-smallcap> If a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) protective provisions in the judgment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shaping the relief; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) other measures;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Pleading the Reasons for Nonjoinder.</cap-smallcap> When asserting a claim for relief, a party must state:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the name, if known, of any person who is required to be joined if feasible but is not joined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reasons for not joining that person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exception for Class Actions.</cap-smallcap> This rule is subject to Rule 23.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. The first sentence with verbal differences (e.g., &ldquo;united&rdquo; interest for &ldquo;joint&rdquo; interest) is to be found in [former] Equity Rule 37 (Parties Generally&mdash;Intervention). Such compulsory joinder provisions are common. Compare Alaska Comp. Laws (1933) &sect;3392 (containing in same sentence a &ldquo;class suit&rdquo; provision); Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Courtright, 1931) &sect;89&ndash;515 (immediately followed by &ldquo;class suit&rdquo; provisions, &sect;89&ndash;516). See also [former] Equity Rule 42 (Joint and Several Demands). For example of a proper case for involuntary plaintiff, see <em>Independent Wireless Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corp. of America</em>, 269 U.S. 459 (1926).</p>
<p class="note-body">The joinder provisions of this rule are subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. For the substance of this rule see [former] Equity Rule 39 (Absence of Persons Who Would be Proper Parties) and U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;111 [now 1391] (When part of several defendants cannot be served); <em>Camp v. Gress</em>, 250 U.S. 308 (1919). See also the second and third sentences of [former] Equity Rule 37 (Parties Generally&mdash;Intervention).</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>General Considerations</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Whenever feasible, the persons materially interested in the subject of an action&mdash;see the more detailed description of these persons in the discussion of new subdivision (a) below&mdash;should be joined as parties so that they may be heard and a complete disposition made. When this comprehensive joinder cannot be accomplished&mdash;a situation which may be encountered in Federal courts because of limitations on service of process, subject matter jurisdiction, and venue&mdash;the case should be examined pragmatically and a choice made between the alternatives of proceeding with the action in the absence of particular interested persons, and dismissing the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">Even if the court is mistaken in its decision to proceed in the absence of an interested person, it does not by that token deprive itself of the power to adjudicate as between the parties already before it through proper service of process. But the court can make a legally binding adjudication only between the parties actually joined in the action. It is true that an adjudication between the parties before the court may on occasion adversely affect the absent person as a practical matter, or leave a party exposed to a later inconsistent recovery by the absent person. These are factors which should be considered in deciding whether the action should proceed, or should rather be dismissed; but they do not themselves negate the court's power to adjudicate as between the parties who have been joined.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Defects in the Original Rule</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The foregoing propositions were well understood in the older equity practice, see Hazard, <em>Indispensable <!-- PDFPage:150 -->Party: The Historical Origin of a Procedural Phantom</em>, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1254 (1961), and Rule 19 could be and often was applied in consonance with them. But experience showed that the rule was defective in its phrasing and did not point clearly to the proper basis of decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Textual defects.&mdash;(1) The expression &ldquo;persons *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* who ought to be parties if complete relief is to be accorded between those already parties,&rdquo; appearing in original subdivision (b), was apparently intended as a description of the persons whom it would be desirable to join in the action, all questions of feasibility of joinder being put to one side; but it was not adequately descriptive of those persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The word &ldquo;Indispensable,&rdquo; appearing in original subdivision (b), was apparently intended as an inclusive reference to the interested persons in whose absence it would be advisable, all factors having been considered, to dismiss the action. Yet the sentence implied that there might be interested persons, not &ldquo;indispensable.&rdquo; in whose absence the action ought also to be dismissed. Further, it seemed at least superficially plausible to equate the word &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; with the expression &ldquo;having a joint interest,&rdquo; appearing in subdivision (a). See <em>United States v. Washington Inst. of Tech., Inc</em>., 138 F.2d 25, 26 (3d Cir. 1943); cf. <em>Chidester v. City of Newark</em>, 162 F.2d 598 (3d Cir. 1947). But persons holding an interest technically &ldquo;joint&rdquo; are not always so related to an action that it would be unwise to proceed without joining all of them, whereas persons holding an interest not technically &ldquo;joint&rdquo; may have this relation to an action. See Reed, <em>Compulsory Joinder of Parties in Civil Actions</em>, 55 Mich.L.Rev. 327, 356 ff., 483 (1957).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The use of &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint interest&rdquo; in the context of original Rule 19 directed attention to the technical or abstract character of the rights or obligations of the persons whose joinder was in question, and correspondingly distracted attention from the pragmatic considerations which should be controlling.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The original rule, in dealing with the feasibility of joining a person as a party to the action, besides referring to whether the person was &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction of the court as to both service of process and venue,&rdquo; spoke of whether the person could be made a party &ldquo;without depriving the court of jurisdiction of the parties before it.&rdquo; The second quoted expression used &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; in the sense of the competence of the court over the subject matter of the action, and in this sense the expression was apt. However, by a familiar confusion, the expression seems to have suggested to some that the absence from the lawsuit of a person who was &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; or &ldquo;who ought to be [a] part[y]&rdquo; itself deprived the court of the power to adjudicate as between the parties already joined. See <em>Samuel Goldwyn, Inc. v. United Artists Corp</em>., 113 F.2d 703, 707 (3d Cir. 1940); <em>McArthur v. Rosenbaum Co. of Pittsburgh</em>, 180 F.2d 617, 621 (3d Cir. 1949); cf. <em>Calcote v. Texas Pac. Coal & Oil Co</em>., 157 F.2d 216 (5th Cir. 1946), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 782 (1946), noted in 56 Yale L.J. 1088 (1947); Reed, supra, 55 Mich.L.Rev. at 332&ndash;34.</p>
<p class="note-body">Failure to point to correct basis of decision. The original rule did not state affirmatively what factors were relevant in deciding whether the action should proceed or be dismissed when joinder of interested persons was infeasible. In some instances courts did not undertake the relevant inquiry or were misled by the &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; fallacy. In other instances there was undue preoccupation with abstract classifications of rights or obligations, as against consideration of the particular consequences of proceeding with the action and the ways by which these consequences might be ameliorated by the shaping of final relief or other precautions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although these difficulties cannot be said to have been general analysis of the cases showed that there was good reason for attempting to strengthen the rule. The literature also indicated how the rule should be reformed. See Reed, supra (discussion of the important case of <em>Shields v. Barrow</em>, 17 How. (58 U.S.) 130 (1854), appears at 55 Mich.L.Rev., p. 340 ff.); Hazard, supra; N.Y. Temporary Comm. on Courts, First Preliminary Report, Legis.Doc. 1957, No. 6(b), pp. 28, 233; N.Y. Judicial Council, Twelfth Ann.Rep., Legis.Doc. 1946, No. 17, p. 163; Joint Comm. on Michigan Procedural Revision, Final Report, Pt. III, p. 69 (1960); Note, <em>Indispensable Parties in the Federal Courts</em>, 65 Harv.L.Rev. 1050 (1952); <em>Developments in the Law&mdash;Multiparty Litigation in the Federal Courts</em>, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 874, 879 (1958); Mich.Gen.Court Rules, R. 205 (effective Jan. 1, 1963); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law & Rules, &sect;1001 (effective Sept. 1, 1963).</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>The Amended Rule</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (a) defines the persons whose joinder in the action is desirable. Clause (1) stresses the desirability of joining those persons in whose absence the court would be obliged to grant partial or &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; rather than complete relief to the parties before the court. The interests that are being furthered here are not only those of the parties, but also that of the public in avoiding repeated lawsuits on the same essential subject matter. Clause (2)(i) recognizes the importance of protecting the person whose joinder is in question against the practical prejudice to him which may arise through a disposition of the action in his absence. Clause (2)(ii) recognizes the need for considering whether a party may be left, after the adjudication, in a position where a person not joined can subject him to a double or otherwise inconsistent liability. See Reed, supra, 55 Mich.L.Rev. at 330, 338; Note, supra, 65 Harv.L.Rev. at 1052&ndash;57; Developments in the Law, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 881&ndash;85.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision (a) definition of persons to be joined is not couched in terms of the abstract nature of their interests&mdash;&ldquo;joint,&rdquo; &ldquo;united,&rdquo; &ldquo;separable,&rdquo; or the like. See N.Y. Temporary Comm. on Courts, First Preliminary Report, supra; Developments in the Law, supra, at 880. It should be noted particularly, however, that the description is not at variance with the settled authorities holding that a tortfeasor with the usual &ldquo;joint-and-several&rdquo; liability is merely a permissive party to an action against another with like liability. See 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> 2153 (2d ed. 1963); 2 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;513.8 (Wright ed. 1961). Joinder of these tortfeasors continues to be regulated by Rule 20; compare Rule 14 on third-party practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)(2) is amenable to service of process and his joinder would not deprive the court of jurisdiction in the sense of competence over the action, he should be joined as a party; and if he has not been joined, the court should order him to be brought into the action. If a party joined has a valid objection to the venue and chooses to assert it, he will be dismissed from the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;When a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) cannot be made a party, the court is to determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties already before it, or should be dismissed. That this decision is to be made in the light of pragmatic considerations has often been acknowledged by the courts. See <em>Roos v. Texas Co</em>., 23 F.2d 171 (2d Cir. 1927), cert. denied, 277 U.S. 587 (1928); <em>Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders, Union</em>, 254 U.S. 77, 80 (1920). The subdivision sets out four relevant considerations drawn from the experience revealed in the decided cases. The factors are to a certain extent overlapping, and they are not intended to exclude other considerations which may be applicable in particular situations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first factor brings in a consideration of what a judgment in the action would mean to the absentee. Would the absentee be adversely affected in a practical sense, and if so, would the prejudice be immediate and serious, or remote and minor? The possible collateral consequences of the judgment upon the parties already joined are also to be appraised. Would any party be exposed to a fresh action by the absentee, and if so, how serious is the threat? See the elaborate discussion in Reed, supra; cf. <em>A. L. Smith Iron Co. v. Dickson</em>, 141 F.2d 3 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>Caldwell Mfg. Co. v. Unique Balance Co</em>., 18 F.R.D. 258 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:151 --><p class="note-body">The second factor calls attention to the measures by which prejudice may be averted or lessened. The &ldquo;shaping of relief&rdquo; is a familiar expedient to this end. See, e.g., the award of money damages in lieu of specific relief where the latter might affect an absentee adversely. <em>Ward v. Deavers</em>, 203 F.2d 72 (D.C.Cir. 1953); <em>Miller & Lux, Inc. v. Nickel</em>, 141 F.Supp. 41 (N.D.Calif. 1956). On the use of &ldquo;protective provisions,&rdquo; see <em>Roos v. Texas Co</em>., supra; <em>Atwood v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co</em>., 275 Fed. 513, 519 (1st Cir. 1921), cert. denied, 257 U.S. 661 (1922); cf. <em>Stumpf v. Fidelity Gas Co</em>., 294 F.2d 886 (9th Cir. 1961); and the general statement in <em>National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board</em>, 309 U.S. 350, 363 (1940).</p>
<p class="note-body">Sometimes the party is himself able to take measures to avoid prejudice. Thus a defendant faced with a prospect of a second suit by an absentee may be in a position to bring the latter into the action by defensive interpleader. See <em>Hudson v. Newell</em>, 172 F.2d 848, 852 mod., 176 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1949); <em>Gauss v. Kirk</em>, 198 F.2d 83, 86 (D.C.Cir. 1952); <em>Abel v. Brayton Flying Service, Inc</em>., 248 F.2d 713, 716 (5th Cir. 1957) (suggestion of possibility of counterclaim under Rule 13(h)); cf. <em>Parker Rust-Proof Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co</em>., 105 F.2d 976 (2d Cir. 1939) cert. denied, 308 U.S. 597 (1939). See also the absentee may sometimes be able to avert prejudice to himself by voluntarily appearing in the action or intervening on an ancillary basis. See <em>Developments in the Law</em>, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 882; Annot., <em>Intervention or Subsequent Joinder of Parties as Affecting Jurisdiction of Federal Court Based on Diversity of Citizenship</em>, 134 A.L.R. 335 (1941); <em>Johnson v. Middleton</em>, 175 F.2d 535 (7th Cir. 1949); <em>Kentucky Nat. Gas Corp. v. Duggins</em>, 165 F.2d 1011 (6th Cir. 1948); <em>McComb v. McCormack</em>, 159 F.2d 219 (5th Cir. 1947). The court should consider whether this, in turn, would impose undue hardship on the absentee. (For the possibility of the court's informing an absentee of the pendency of the action, see comment under subdivision (c) below.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The third factor&mdash;whether an &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; judgment can be rendered in the absence of a given person&mdash;calls attention to the extent of the relief that can be accorded among the parties joined. It meshes with the other factors, especially the &ldquo;shaping of relief&rdquo; mentioned under the second factor. Cf. <em>Kroese v. General Steel Castings Corp</em>., 179 F.2d 760 (3d Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 983 (1950).</p>
<p class="note-body">The fourth factor, looking to the practical effects of a dismissal, indicates that the court should consider whether there is any assurance that the plaintiff, if dismissed, could sue effectively in another forum where better joinder would be possible. See <em>Fitzgerald v. Haynes</em>, 241 F.2d 417, 420 (3d Cir. 1957); <em>Fouke v. Schenewerk</em>, 197 F.2d 234, 236 (5th Cir. 1952); cf. <em>Warfield v. Marks</em>, 190 F.2d 178 (5th Cir. 1951).</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision uses the word &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; only in a conclusory sense, that is, a person is &ldquo;regarded as indispensable&rdquo; when he cannot be made a party and, upon consideration of the factors above mention, it is determined that in his absence it would be preferable to dismiss the action, rather than to retain it.</p>
<p class="note-body">A person may be added as a party at any stage of the action on motion or on the court's initiative (see Rule 21); and a motion to dismiss, on the ground that a person has not been joined and justice requires that the action should not proceed in his absence, may be made as late as the trial on the merits (see Rule 12(h)(2), as amended; cf. Rule 12(b)(7), as amended). However, when the moving party is seeking dismissal in order to protect himself against a later suit by the absent person (subdivision (a)(2)(ii)), and is not seeking vicariously to protect the absent person against a prejudicial judgment (subdivision (a)(2)(i)), his undue delay in making the motion can properly be counted against him as a reason for denying the motion. A joinder question should be decided with reasonable promptness, but decision may properly be deferred if adequate information is not available at the time. Thus the relationship of an absent person to the action, and the practical effects of an adjudication upon him and others, may not be sufficiently revealed at the pleading stage; in such a case it would be appropriate to defer decision until the action was further advanced. Cf. Rule 12(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule makes no special provision for the problem arising in suits against subordinate Federal officials where it has often been set up as a defense that some superior officer must be joined. Frequently this defense has been accompanied by or intermingled with defenses of sovereign community or lack of consent of the United States to suit. So far as the issue of joinder can be isolated from the rest, the new subdivision seems better adapted to handle it than the predecessor provision. See the discussion in <em>Johnson v. Kirkland</em>, 290 F.2d 440, 446&ndash;47 (5th Cir. 1961) (stressing the practical orientation of the decisions); <em>Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro</em>, 349 U.S. 48, 54 (1955). Recent legislation, P.L. 87&ndash;748, 76 Stat. 744, approved October 5, 1962, adding &sect;&sect;1361, 1391(e) to Title 28, U.S.C., vests original jurisdiction in the District Courts over actions in the nature of mandamus to compel officials of the United States to perform their legal duties, and extends the range of service of process and liberalizes venue in these actions. If, then, it is found that a particular official should be joined in the action, the legislation will make it easy to bring him in.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) parallels the predecessor subdivision (c) of Rule 19. In some situations it may be desirable to advise a person who has not been joined of the fact that the action is pending, and in particular cases the court in its discretion may itself convey this information by directing a letter or other informal notice to the absentee.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) repeats the exception contained in the first clause of the predecessor subdivision (a).</p>

<p class="note-body">Former Rule 19(b) described the conclusion that an action should be dismissed for inability to join a Rule 19(a) party by carrying forward traditional terminology: &ldquo;the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indispensable&rdquo; was used only to express a conclusion reached by applying the tests of Rule 19(b). It has been discarded as redundant.</p>
