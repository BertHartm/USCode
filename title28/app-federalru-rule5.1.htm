<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>Petition for Leave to Appeal; Answer or Cross Petition</em>.&mdash;An appeal from a district court judgment, entered after an appeal under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c)(4) to a district judge from a judgment entered upon direction of a magistrate judge in a civil case, may be sought by filing a petition for leave to appeal. An appeal on petition for leave to appeal is not a matter of right, but its allowance is a matter of sound judicial discretion. The petition shall be filed with the clerk of the court of appeals within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a notice of appeal, with proof of service on all parties to the action in the district court. A notice of appeal need not be filed. Within 14 days after service of the petition, a party may file an answer in opposition or a cross petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Content of Petition; Answer</em>.&mdash;The petition for leave to appeal shall contain a statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the questions to be presented by the appeal; a statement of those questions and of the relief sought; a statement of the reasons why in the opinion of the petitioner the appeal should be allowed; and a copy of the order, decree or judgment complained of and any opinion or memorandum relating thereto. The petition and answer shall be submitted to a panel of judges of the court of appeals without oral argument unless otherwise ordered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <em>Form of Papers; Number of Copies</em>.&mdash;All papers may be typewritten. An original and three copies must be filed unless the court requires the filing of a different number by local rule or by order in a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <em>Allowance of the Appeal; Fees; Cost Bond; Filing of Record</em>.&mdash;Within 10 days after the entry of an order granting the appeal, the appellant shall (1) pay to the clerk of the district court the fees established by statute and the docket fee prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States and (2) file a bond for costs if required pursuant to Rule 7. The clerk of the district court shall notify the clerk of the court of appeals of the payment of the fees. Upon receipt of such notice, the clerk of the court of appeals shall enter the appeal upon the docket. The record shall be transmitted and filed in accordance with Rules 11 and 12(b).</p>

<p class="note-body">When the initial appeal of a magistrate's decision is taken to the district court, the statute provides for a second discretionary appeal to the court of appeals. This rule provides the procedure for taking such an appeal.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment conforms the rule to the change in title from &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; to &ldquo;magistrate judge&rdquo; made by the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101&ndash;650, 104 Stat. 5089, 5117 (1990).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment makes it clear that a court may require a different number of copies either by rule or by order in an individual case. The number of copies of any document that a court of appeals needs varies depending upon the way in which the court conducts business. The internal operation of the courts of appeals necessarily varies from circuit to circuit because of differences in the number of judges, the geographic area included within the circuit, and other such factors. Uniformity could be achieved only by setting the number of copies artificially high so that parties in all circuits file enough copies to satisfy the needs of the court requiring the greatest number. Rather than do that, the Committee decided to make it clear that local rules may require a greater or lesser number of copies and that, if the circumstances of a particular case indicate the need for a different number of copies in that case, the court may so order.</p>
