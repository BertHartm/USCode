<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Authentication and identification represent a special aspect of relevancy. Michael and Adler, Real Proof, 5 Vand.L.Rev. 344, 362 (1952); McCormick &sect;&sect;179, 185; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 378. (1962). Thus a telephone conversation may be irrelevant because on an unrelated topic or because the speaker is not identified. The latter aspect is the one here involved. Wigmore describes the need for authentication as &ldquo;an inherent logical necessity.&rdquo; 7 Wigmore &sect;2129, p. 564.</p>
<p class="note-body">This requirement of showing authenticity or identity fails in the category of relevancy dependent upon fulfillment of a condition of fact and is governed by the procedure set forth in Rule 104(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The common law approach to authentication of documents has been criticized as an &ldquo;attitude of agnosticism,&rdquo; McCormick, Cases on Evidence 388, n. 4 (3rd ed. 1956), as one which &ldquo;departs sharply from men's customs in ordinary affairs,&rdquo; and as presenting only a slight obstacle to the introduction of forgeries in comparison to the time and expense devoted to proving genuine writings which correctly show their origin on <!-- PDFPage:403 -->their face, McCormick &sect;185, pp. 395, 396. Today, such available procedures as requests to admit and pretrial conference afford the means of eliminating much of the need for authentication or identification. Also, significant inroads upon the traditional insistence on authentication and identification have been made by accepting as at least prima facie genuine items of the kind treated in Rule 902, <em>infra</em>. However, the need for suitable methods of proof still remains, since criminal cases pose their own obstacles to the use of preliminary procedures, unforeseen contingencies may arise, and cases of genuine controversy will still occur.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The treatment of authentication and identification draws largely upon the experience embodied in the common law and in statutes to furnish illustrative applications of the general principle set forth in subdivision (a). The examples are not intended as an exclusive enumeration of allowable methods but are meant to guide and suggest, leaving room for growth and development in this area of the law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The examples relate for the most part to documents, with some attention given to voice communications and computer print-outs. As Wigmore noted, no special rules have been developed for authenticating chattels. Wigmore, Code of Evidence &sect;2086 (3rd ed. 1942).</p>
<p class="note-body">It should be observed that compliance with requirements of authentication or identification by no means assures admission of an item into evidence, as other bars, hearsay for example, may remain.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (1)</em>. Example (1) contemplates a broad spectrum ranging from testimony of a witness who was present at the signing of a document to testimony establishing narcotics as taken from an accused and accounting for custody through the period until trial, including laboratory analysis. See California Evidence Code &sect;1413, eyewitness to signing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (2)</em>. Example (2) states conventional doctrine as to lay identification of handwriting, which recognizes that a sufficient familiarity with the handwriting of another person may be acquired by seeing him write, by exchanging correspondence, or by other means, to afford a basis for identifying it on subsequent occasions. McCormick &sect;189. See also California Evidence Code &sect;1416. Testimony based upon familiarity acquired for purposes of the litigation is reserved to the expert under the example which follows.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (3)</em>. The history of common law restrictions upon the technique of proving or disproving the genuineness of a disputed specimen of handwriting through comparison with a genuine specimen, by either the testimony of expert witnesses or direct viewing by the triers themselves, is detailed in 7 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1991&ndash;1994. In breaking away, the English Common Law Procedure Act of 1854, 17 and 18 Viet., c. 125, &sect;27, cautiously allowed expert or trier to use exemplars &ldquo;proved to the satisfaction of the judge to be genuine&rdquo; for purposes of comparison. The language found its way into numerous statutes in this country, e.g., California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1417, 1418. While explainable as a measure of prudence in the process of breaking with precedent in the handwriting situation, the reservation to the judge of the question of the genuineness of exemplars and the imposition of an unusually high standard of persuasion are at variance with the general treatment of relevancy which depends upon fulfillment of a condition of fact. Rule 104(b). No similar attitude is found in other comparison situations, e.g., ballistics comparison by jury, as in <em>Evans v. Commonwealth</em>, 230 Ky. 411, 19 S.W.2d 1091 (1929), or by experts, Annot. 26 A.L.R.2d 892, and no reason appears for its continued existence in handwriting cases. Consequently Example (3) sets no higher standard for handwriting specimens and treats all comparison situations alike, to be governed by Rule 104(b). This approach is consistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1731: &ldquo;The admitted or proved handwriting of any person shall be admissible, for purposes of comparison, to determine genuineness of other handwriting attributed to such person.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Precedent supports the acceptance of visual comparison as sufficiently satisfying preliminary authentication requirements for admission in evidence. <em>Brandon v. Collins</em>, 267 F.2d 731 (2d Cir. 1959); <em>Wausau Sulphate Fibre Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</em>, 61 F.2d 879 (7th Cir. 1932); <em>Desimone v. United States</em>, 227 F.2d 864 (9th Cir. 1955).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (4)</em>. The characteristics of the offered item itself, considered in the light of circumstances, afford authentication techniques in great variety. Thus a document or telephone conversation may be shown to have emanated from a particular person by virtue of its disclosing knowledge of facts known peculiarly to him; <em>Globe Automatic Sprinkler Co. v. Braniff</em>, 89 Okl. 105, 214 P. 127 (1923); California Evidence Code &sect;1421; similarly, a letter may be authenticated by content and circumstances indicating it was in reply to a duly authenticated one. McCormick &sect;192; California Evidence Code &sect;1420. Language patterns may indicate authenticity or its opposite. <em>Magnuson v. State</em>, 187 Wis. 122, 203 N.W. 749 (1925); Arens and Meadow, Psycholinguistics and the Confession Dilemma, 56 Colum.L.Rev. 19 (1956).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (5)</em>. Since aural voice identification is not a subject of expert testimony, the requisite familiarity may be acquired either before or after the particular speaking which is the subject of the identification, in this respect resembling visual identification of a person rather than identification of handwriting. Cf. Example (2), <em>supra, People v. Nichols</em>, 378 Ill. 487, 38 N.E.2d 766 (1942); <em>McGuire v. State</em>, 200 Md. 601, 92 A.2d 582 (1952); <em>State v. McGee</em>, 336 Mo. 1082, 83 S.W.2d 98 (1935).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (6)</em>. The cases are in agreement that a mere assertion of his identity by a person talking on the telephone is not sufficient evidence of the authenticity of the conversation and that additional evidence of his identity is required. The additional evidence need not fall in any set pattern. Thus the content of his statements or the reply technique, under Example (4), <em>supra</em>, or voice identification under Example (5), may furnish the necessary foundation. Outgoing calls made by the witness involve additional factors bearing upon authenticity. The calling of a number assigned by the telephone company reasonably supports the assumption that the listing is correct and that the number is the one reached. If the number is that of a place of business, the mass of authority allows an ensuing conversation if it relates to business reasonably transacted over the telephone, on the theory that the maintenance of the telephone connection is an invitation to do business without further identification. <em>Matton v. Hoover Co</em>., 350 Mo. 506, 166 S.W.2d 557 (1942); <em>City of Pawhuska v. Crutchfield</em>, 147 Okl. 4. 293 P. 1095 (1930); <em>Zurich General Acc. & Liability Ins. Co. v. Baum</em>, 159 Va. 404, 165 S.E. 518 (1932). Otherwise, some additional circumstance of identification of the speaker is required. The authorities divide on the question whether the self-identifying statement of the person answering suffices. Example (6) answers in the affirmative on the assumption that usual conduct respecting telephone calls furnish adequate assurances of regularity, bearing in mind that the entire matter is open to exploration before the trier of fact. In general, see McCormick &sect;193; 7 Wigmore &sect;2155; Annot., 71 A.L.R. 5, 105 id. 326.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (7)</em>. Public records are regularly authenticated by proof of custody, without more. McCormick &sect;191; 7 Wigmore &sect;&sect;2158, 2159. The example extends the principle to include data stored in computers and similar methods, of which increasing use in the public records area may be expected. See California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1532, 1600.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (8)</em>. The familiar ancient document rule of the common law is extended to include data stored electronically or by other similar means. Since the importance of appearance diminishes in this situation, the importance of custody or place where found increases correspondingly. This expansion is necessary in view of the widespread use of methods of storing data in forms other than conventional written records.</p>
<p class="note-body">Any time period selected is bound to be arbitrary. The common law period of 30 years is here reduced to 20 years, with some shift of emphasis from the probable unavailability of witnesses to the unlikeliness of a still <!-- PDFPage:404 -->viable fraud after the lapse of time. The shorter period is specified in the English Evidence Act of 1938, 1 & 2 Geo. 6, c. 28, and in Oregon R.S. 1963, &sect;41.360(34). See also the numerous statutes prescribing periods of less than 30 years in the case of recorded documents. 7 Wigmore &sect;2143.</p>
<p class="note-body">The application of Example (8) is not subject to any limitation to title documents or to any requirement that possession, in the case of a title document, has been consistent with the document. See McCormick &sect;190.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (9)</em>. Example (9) is designed for situations in which the accuracy of a result is dependent upon a process or system which produces it. X-rays afford a familiar instance. Among more recent developments is the computer, as to which see <em>Transport Indemnity Co. v. Seib</em>, 178 Neb. 253, 132 N.W.2d 871 (1965); <em>State v. Veres</em>, 7 Ariz.App. 117, 436 P.2d 629 (1968); <em>Merrick v. United States Rubber Co</em>., 7 Ariz.App. 433, 440 P.2d 314 (1968); Freed, Computer Print-Outs as Evidence, 16 Am.Jur. Proof of Facts 273; Symposium, Law and Computers in the Mid-Sixties, ALI-ABA (1966); 37 Albany L.Rev. 61 (1967). Example (9) does not, of course, foreclose taking judicial notice of the accuracy of the process or system.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Example (10)</em>. The example makes clear that methods of authentication provided by Act of Congress and by the Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure or by Bankruptcy Rules are not intended to be superseded. Illustrative are the provisions for authentication of official records in Civil Procedure Rule 44 and Criminal Procedure Rule 27, for authentication of records of proceedings by court reporters in 28 U.S.C. &sect;753(b) and Civil Procedure Rule 80(c), and for authentication of depositions in Civil Procedure Rule 30(f).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">Case law and statutes have, over the years, developed a substantial body of instances in which authenticity is taken as sufficiently established for purposes of admissibility without extrinsic evidence to that effect, sometimes for reasons of policy but perhaps more often because practical considerations reduce the possibility of unauthenticity to a very small dimension. The present rule collects and incorporates these situations, in some instances expanding them to occupy a larger area which their underlying considerations justify. In no instance is the opposite party foreclosed from disputing authenticity.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. The acceptance of documents bearing a public seal and signature, most often encountered in practice in the form of acknowledgments or certificates authenticating copies of public records, is actually of broad application. Whether theoretically based in whole or in part upon judicial notice, the practical underlying considerations are that forgery is a crime and detection is fairly easy and certain. 7 Wigmore &sect;2161, p. 638; California Evidence Code &sect;1452. More than 50 provisions for judicial notice of official seals are contained in the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em>. While statutes are found which raise a presumption of genuineness of purported official signatures in the absence of an official seal, 7 Wigmore &sect;2167; California Evidence Code &sect;1453, the greater ease of effecting a forgery under these circumstances is apparent. Hence this paragraph of the rule calls for authentication by an officer who has a seal. Notarial acts by members of the armed forces and other special situations are covered in paragraph (10).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3</em>) provides a method for extending the presumption of authenticity to foreign official documents by a procedure of certification. It is derived from Rule 44(a)(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure but is broader in applying to public documents rather than being limited to public records.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em>. The common law and innumerable statutes have recognized the procedure of authenticating copies of public records by certificate. The certificate qualifies as a public document, receivable as authentic when in conformity with paragraph (1), (2), or (3). Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided authentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records. It will be observed that the certification procedure here provided extends only to public records, reports, and recorded documents, all including data compilations, and does not apply to public documents generally. Hence documents provable when presented in original form under paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) may not be provable by certified copy under paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (5)</em>. Dispensing with preliminary proof of the genuineness of purportedly official publications, most commonly encountered in connection with statutes, court reports, rules, and regulations, has been greatly enlarged by statutes and decisions. 5 Wigmore &sect;1684. Paragraph (5), it will be noted, does not confer admissibility upon all official publications; it merely provides a means whereby their authenticity may be taken as established for purposes of admissibility. Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure has been to the same effect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em>. The likelihood of forgery of newspapers or periodicals is slight indeed. Hence no danger is apparent in receiving them. Establishing the authenticity of the publication may, of course, leave still open questions of authority and responsibility for items therein contained. See 7 Wigmore &sect;2150. Cf. 39 U.S.C. &sect;4005(b), public advertisement prima facie evidence of agency of person named, in postal fraud order proceeding; Canadian Uniform Evidence Act, Draft of 1936, printed copy of newspaper prima facie evidence that notices or advertisements were authorized.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (7)</em>. Several factors justify dispensing with preliminary proof of genuineness of commercial and mercantile labels and the like. The risk of forgery is minimal. Trademark infringement involves serious penalties. Great efforts are devoted to inducing the public to buy in reliance on brand names, and substantial protection is given them. Hence the fairness of this treatment finds recognition in the cases. <em>Curtiss Candy Co. v. Johnson</em>, 163 Miss. 426, 141 So. 762 (1932), Baby Ruth candy bar; <em>Doyle v. Continental Baking Co</em>., 262 Mass. 516, 160 N.E. 325 (1928), loaf of bread; <em>Weiner v. Mager & Throne, Inc</em>., 167 Misc. 338, 3 N.Y.S.2d 918 (1938), same. And see W.Va.Code 1966, &sect;47&ndash;3&ndash;5, trade-mark on bottle prima facie evidence of ownership. <em>Contra, Keegan v. Green Giant Co</em>., 150 Me. 283, 110 A.2d 599 (1954); <em>Murphy v. Campbell Soup Co</em>., 62 F.2d 564 (1st Cir. 1933). Cattle brands have received similar acceptance in the western states. Rev.Code Mont.1947, &sect;46&ndash;606; <em>State v. Wolfley</em>, 75 Kan. 406, 89 P. 1046 (1907); Annot., 11 L.R.A. (N.S.) 87. Inscriptions on trains and vehicles are held to be prima facie evidence of ownership or control. <em>Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. Ry. v. Callaghan</em>, 157 Ill. 406, 41 N.E. 909 (1895); 9 Wigmore &sect;2510a. See also the provision of 19 U.S.C. &sect;1615(2) that marks, labels, brands, or stamps indicating foreign origin are prima facie evidence of foreign origin of merchandise.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (8)</em>. In virtually every state, acknowledged title documents are receivable in evidence without further proof. Statutes are collected in 5 Wigmore &sect;1676. If this authentication suffices for documents of the importance of those affecting titles, logic scarcely permits denying this method when other kinds of documents are involved. Instances of broadly inclusive statutes are California Evidence Code &sect;1451 and N.Y.CPLR 4538, McKinney's Consol. Laws 1963.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (9)</em>. Issues of the authenticity of commercial paper in federal courts will usually arise in diversity cases, will involve an element of a cause of action or defense, and with respect to presumptions and burden of proof will be controlled by <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Rule 302, <em>supra</em>. There may, however, be questions of authenticity involving lesser segments of a case or the case may be one governed by federal common law. <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States</em>, 318 U.S. 363, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943). Cf. <em>United States v. Yazell</em>, 382 U.S. 341, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966). In these situ<!-- PDFPage:406 -->ations, resort to the useful authentication provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code is provided for. While the phrasing is in terms of &ldquo;general commercial law,&rdquo; in order to avoid the potential complication inherent in borrowing local statutes, today one would have difficulty in determining the general commercial law without referring to the Code. See <em>Williams v. Walker-Thomas-Furniture Co</em>., 121 U.S.App.D.C. 315, 350 F.2d 445 (1965). Pertinent Code provisions are sections 1&ndash;202, 3&ndash;307, and 3&ndash;510, dealing with third-party documents, signatures on negotiable instruments, protests, and statements of dishonor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (10)</em>. The paragraph continues in effect dispensations with preliminary proof of genuineness provided in various Acts of Congress. See, for example, 10 U.S.C. &sect;936, signature, without seal, together with title, prima facie evidence of authenticity of acts of certain military personnel who are given notarial power; 15 U.S.C. &sect;77f(a), signature on SEC registration presumed genuine; 26 U.S.C. &sect;6064, signature to tax return prima facie genuine.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 902(8) as submitted by the Court referred to certificates of acknowledgment &ldquo;under the hand and seal of&rdquo; a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments. The Committee amended the Rule to eliminate the requirement, believed to be inconsistent with the law in some States, that a notary public must affix a seal to a document acknowledged before him. As amended the Rule merely requires that the document be executed in the manner prescribed by State law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved Rule 902(9) as submitted by the Court. With respect to the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;general commercial law&rdquo;, the Committee intends that the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in virtually every State, will be followed generally, but that federal commercial law will apply where federal commercial paper is involved. See <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States</em>, 318 U.S. 363 (1943). Further, in those instances in which the issues are governed by <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), State law will apply irrespective of whether it is the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1988 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">These two sentences were inadvertently eliminated from the 1987 amendments. The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment adds two new paragraphs to the rule on self-authentication. It sets forth a procedure by which parties can authenticate certain records of regularly conducted activity, other than through the testimony of a foundation witness. See the amendment to Rule 803(6). 18 U.S.C. &sect;3505 currently provides a means for certifying foreign records of regularly conducted activity in criminal cases, and this amendment is intended to establish a similar procedure for domestic records, and for foreign records offered in civil cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">A declaration that satisfies 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 would satisfy the declaration requirement of Rule 902(11), as would any comparable certification under oath.</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice requirement in Rules 902(11) and (12) is intended to give the opponent of the evidence a full opportunity to test the adequacy of the foundation set forth in the declaration.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report&mdash;Proposed Amendment to Rule 902</em>. The Committee made the following changes to the published draft of the proposed amendment to Evidence Rule 902:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text, in accordance with suggestions of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The phrase &ldquo;in a manner complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority&rdquo; was added to proposed Rule 902(11), to provide consistency with Evidence Rule 902(4). The Committee Note was amended to accord with this textual change.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text to provide a uniform construction of the terms &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; and &ldquo;certifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The notice provisions in the text were revised to clarify that the proponent must make both the declaration and the underlying record available for inspection.</p>
