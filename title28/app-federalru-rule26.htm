<h3 class="section-head">Rule 26. Computing and Extending Time</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Computing Time.</cap-smallcap> The following rules apply in computing any period of time specified in these rules or in any local rule, court order, or applicable statute:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Exclude the day of the act, event, or default that begins the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Exclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period is less than 11 days, unless stated in calendar days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Include the last day of the period unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or&mdash;if the act to be done is filing a paper in court&mdash;a day on which the weather or other conditions make the clerk's office inaccessible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) As used in this rule, &ldquo;legal holiday&rdquo; means New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans&rsquo; Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and any other day declared a holiday by the President, Congress, or the state in which is located either the district court that rendered the challenged judgment or order, or the circuit clerk's principal office.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Extending Time.</cap-smallcap> For good cause, the court may extend the time prescribed by these rules or by its order to perform any act, or may permit an act to be done after that time expires. But the court may not extend the time to file:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a notice of appeal (except as authorized in Rule 4) or a petition for permission to appeal; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a notice of appeal from or a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify, enforce, or otherwise review an order of an administrative agency, board, commission, or officer of the United States, unless specifically authorized by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Time after Service.</cap-smallcap> When a party is required or permitted to act within a prescribed period after a paper is served on that party, 3 calendar days are added to the prescribed period unless the paper is delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service. For purposes of this Rule 26(c), a paper that is served electronically is not treated as delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of this rule are based upon FRCP 6(a), (b) and (e). See also Supreme Court Rule 34 and FRCrP 45. Unlike FRCP 6(b), this rule, read with Rule 27, requires that every request for enlargement of time be made by motion, with proof of service on all parties. This is the simplest, most convenient way of keeping all parties advised of developments. By the terms of Rule 27(b) a motion for enlargement of time under Rule 26(b) may be entertained and acted upon immediately, subject to the right of any party to seek reconsideration. Thus the requirement of motion and notice will not delay the granting of relief of a kind which a court is inclined to grant as of course. Specifically, if a court is of the view that an extension of time sought before expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order ought to be granted in effect ex parte, as FRCP 6(b) permits, it may grant motions seeking such relief without delay.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1971 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays to conform the subdivision to the Act of June 28, 1968, 82 Stat. 250, which constituted Columbus Day a legal holiday effective after January 1, 1971.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act, which amended Title 5, U.S.C. &sect;6103(a), changes the day on which certain holidays are to be ob<!-- PDFPage:39 -->served. Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day are to be observed on the third Monday in February, the last Monday in May and the fourth Monday in October, respectively, rather than, as heretofore, on February 22, May 30, and November 11, respectively. Columbus Day is to be observed on the second Monday in October. New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas continue to be observed on the traditional days.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., is added to the list of national holidays in Rule 26(a). The amendment to Rule 26(c) is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment brings Rule 26(a) into conformity with the provisions of Rule 6(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 45(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and Rule 9006(a) of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure which allow additional time for filing whenever a clerk's office is inaccessible on the last day for filing due to weather or other conditions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is a companion to the proposed amendments to Rule 25 that permit service on a party by commercial carrier. The amendments to subdivision (c) of this rule make the three-day extension applicable not only when service is accomplished by mail, but whenever delivery to the party being served occurs later than the date of service stated in the proof of service. When service is by mail or commercial carrier, the proof of service recites the date of mailing or delivery to the commercial carrier. If the party being served receives the paper on a later date, the three-day extension applies. If the party being served receives the paper on the same date as the date of service recited in the proof of service, the three-day extension is not available.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also states that the three-day extension is three calendar days. Rule 26(a) states that when a period prescribed or allowed by the rules is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays do not count. Whether the three-day extension in Rule 26(c) is such a period, meaning that three-days could actually be five or even six days, is unclear. The D.C. Circuit recently held that the parallel three-day extension provided in the Civil Rules is not such a period and that weekends and legal holidays do count. <em>CNPq v. Inter-Trade, 50 F.3d 56 (D.C. Cir. 1995)</em>. The Committee believes that is the right result and that the issue should be resolved. Providing that the extension is three calendar days means that if a period would otherwise end on Thursday but the three-day extension applies, the paper must be filed on Monday. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the extension days. Because the last day of the period as extended is Sunday, the paper must be filed the next day, Monday.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; two substantive changes are made, however, in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> First, the amendments make the computation method prescribed in this rule applicable to any time period imposed by a local rule. This means that if a local rule establishing a time limit is permitted, the national rule will govern the computation of that period.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, paragraph (a)(2) includes language clarifying that whenever the rules establish a time period in &ldquo;calendar days,&rdquo; weekends and legal holidays are counted.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2).</em> The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure compute time differently than the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and Fed. R. Crim. P. 45(a) provide that, in computing any period of time, &ldquo;[w]hen the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation.&rdquo; By contrast, Rule 26(a)(2) provides that, in computing any period of time, a litigant should &ldquo;[e]xclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period is less than 7 days, unless stated in calendar days.&rdquo; Thus, deadlines of 7, 8, 9, and 10 days are calculated differently under the rules of civil and criminal procedure than they are under the rules of appellate procedure. This creates a trap for unwary litigants. No good reason for this discrepancy is apparent, and thus Rule 26(a)(2) has been amended so that, under all three sets of rules, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays will be excluded when computing deadlines under 11 days but will be counted when computing deadlines of 11 days and over.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> Rule 26(c) has been amended to provide that when a paper is served on a party by electronic means, and that party is required or permitted to respond to that paper within a prescribed period, 3 calendar days are added to the prescribed period. Electronic service is usually instantaneous, but sometimes it is not, because of technical problems. Also, if a paper is electronically transmitted to a party on a Friday evening, the party may not realize that he or she has been served until two or three days later. Finally, extending the &ldquo;3-day rule&rdquo; to electronic service will encourage parties to consent to such service under Rule 25(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4).</em> Rule 26(a)(4) has been amended to refer to the third Monday in February as &ldquo;Washington's Birthday.&rdquo; A federal statute officially designates the holiday as &ldquo;Washington's Birthday,&rdquo; reflecting the desire of Congress specially to honor the first president of the United States. <em>See</em> 5 U.S.C. &sect;6103(a). During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, references to &ldquo;Washington's Birthday&rdquo; were mistakenly changed to &ldquo;Presidents&rsquo; Day.&rdquo; The amendment corrects that error.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
