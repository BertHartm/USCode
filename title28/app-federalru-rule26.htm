<h3 class="section-head">Rule 26. Computing and Extending Time</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Computing Time.</cap-smallcap> The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit.</em> When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Period Stated in Hours.</em> When the period is stated in hours:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office.</em> Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the last day for filing under Rule 26(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 26(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>&ldquo;Last Day&rdquo; Defined.</em> Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for electronic filing in the district court, at midnight in the court's time zone;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for electronic filing in the court of appeals, at midnight in the time zone of the circuit clerk's principal office;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for filing under Rules 4(c)(1), 25(a)(2)(B), and 25(a)(2)(C)&mdash;and filing by mail under Rule 13(b)&mdash;at the latest time for the method chosen for delivery to the post office, third-party commercial carrier, or prison mailing system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>&ldquo;Next Day&rdquo; Defined.</em> The &ldquo;next day&rdquo; is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>&ldquo;Legal Holiday&rdquo; Defined.</em> &ldquo;Legal holiday&rdquo; means:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans&rsquo; Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the state where either of the following is located: the district court that rendered the challenged judgment or order, or the circuit clerk's principal office.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Extending Time.</cap-smallcap> For good cause, the court may extend the time prescribed by these rules or by its order to perform any act, or may permit an act to be done after that time expires. But the court may not extend the time to file:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a notice of appeal (except as authorized in Rule 4) or a petition for permission to appeal; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a notice of appeal from or a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify, enforce, or otherwise review an order of an administrative agency, board, commission, or officer of the United States, unless specifically authorized by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:42 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Time after Service.</cap-smallcap> When a party may or must act within a specified time after service, 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 26(a), unless the paper is delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service. For purposes of this Rule 26(c), a paper that is served electronically is not treated as delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of this rule are based upon FRCP 6(a), (b) and (e). See also Supreme Court Rule 34 and FRCrP 45. Unlike FRCP 6(b), this rule, read with Rule 27, requires that every request for enlargement of time be made by motion, with proof of service on all parties. This is the simplest, most convenient way of keeping all parties advised of developments. By the terms of Rule 27(b) a motion for enlargement of time under Rule 26(b) may be entertained and acted upon immediately, subject to the right of any party to seek reconsideration. Thus the requirement of motion and notice will not delay the granting of relief of a kind which a court is inclined to grant as of course. Specifically, if a court is of the view that an extension of time sought before expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order ought to be granted in effect ex parte, as FRCP 6(b) permits, it may grant motions seeking such relief without delay.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1971 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment adds Columbus Day to the list of legal holidays to conform the subdivision to the Act of June 28, 1968, 82 Stat. 250, which constituted Columbus Day a legal holiday effective after January 1, 1971.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act, which amended Title 5, U.S.C. &sect;6103(a), changes the day on which certain holidays are to be observed. Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day are to be observed on the third Monday in February, the last Monday in May and the fourth Monday in October, respectively, rather than, as heretofore, on February 22, May 30, and November 11, respectively. Columbus Day is to be observed on the second Monday in October. New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas continue to be observed on the traditional days.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., is added to the list of national holidays in Rule 26(a). The amendment to Rule 26(c) is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment brings Rule 26(a) into conformity with the provisions of Rule 6(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 45(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and Rule 9006(a) of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure which allow additional time for filing whenever a clerk's office is inaccessible on the last day for filing due to weather or other conditions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is a companion to the proposed amendments to Rule 25 that permit service on a party by commercial carrier. The amendments to subdivision (c) of this rule make the three-day extension applicable not only when service is accomplished by mail, but whenever delivery to the party being served occurs later than the date of service stated in the proof of service. When service is by mail or commercial carrier, the proof of service recites the date of mailing or delivery to the commercial carrier. If the party being served receives the paper on a later date, the three-day extension applies. If the party being served receives the paper on the same date as the date of service recited in the proof of service, the three-day extension is not available.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also states that the three-day extension is three calendar days. Rule 26(a) states that when a period prescribed or allowed by the rules is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays do not count. Whether the three-day extension in Rule 26(c) is such a period, meaning that three-days could actually be five or even six days, is unclear. The D.C. Circuit recently held that the parallel three-day extension provided in the Civil Rules is not such a period and that weekends and legal holidays do count. <em>CNPq v. Inter-Trade, 50 F.3d 56 (D.C. Cir. 1995)</em>. The Committee believes that is the right result and that the issue should be resolved. Providing that the extension is three calendar days means that if a period would otherwise end on Thursday but the three-day extension applies, the paper must be filed on Monday. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the extension days. Because the last day of the period as extended is Sunday, the paper must be filed the next day, Monday.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only; two substantive changes are made, however, in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> First, the amendments make the computation method prescribed in this rule applicable to any time period imposed by a local rule. This means that if a local rule establishing a time limit is permitted, the national rule will govern the computation of that period.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, paragraph (a)(2) includes language clarifying that whenever the rules establish a time period in &ldquo;calendar days,&rdquo; weekends and legal holidays are counted.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2).</em> The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure compute time differently than the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and Fed. R. Crim. P. 45(a) provide that, in computing any period of time, &ldquo;[w]hen the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation.&rdquo; By contrast, Rule 26(a)(2) provides that, in computing any period of time, a litigant should &ldquo;[e]xclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period is less than 7 days, unless stated in calendar days.&rdquo; Thus, deadlines of 7, 8, 9, and 10 days are calculated differently under the rules of civil and criminal procedure than they are under the rules of appellate procedure. This creates a trap for unwary litigants. No good reason for this discrepancy is apparent, and thus Rule 26(a)(2) has been amended so that, under all three sets of rules, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays will be excluded when computing deadlines under 11 days but will be counted when computing deadlines of 11 days and over.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> Rule 26(c) has been amended to provide that when a paper is served on a party by elec<!-- PDFPage:43 -->tronic means, and that party is required or permitted to respond to that paper within a prescribed period, 3 calendar days are added to the prescribed period. Electronic service is usually instantaneous, but sometimes it is not, because of technical problems. Also, if a paper is electronically transmitted to a party on a Friday evening, the party may not realize that he or she has been served until two or three days later. Finally, extending the &ldquo;3-day rule&rdquo; to electronic service will encourage parties to consent to such service under Rule 25(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4).</em> Rule 26(a)(4) has been amended to refer to the third Monday in February as &ldquo;Washington's Birthday.&rdquo; A federal statute officially designates the holiday as &ldquo;Washington's Birthday,&rdquo; reflecting the desire of Congress specially to honor the first president of the United States. <em>See</em> 5 U.S.C. &sect;6103(a). During the 1998 restyling of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, references to &ldquo;Washington's Birthday&rdquo; were mistakenly changed to &ldquo;Presidents&rsquo; Day.&rdquo; The amendment corrects that error.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment or to the Committee Note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> Subdivision (a) has been amended to simplify and clarify the provisions that describe how deadlines are computed. Subdivision (a) governs the computation of any time period found in a statute that does not specify a method of computing time, a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure, a local rule, or a court order. In accordance with Rule 47(a)(1), a local rule may not direct that a deadline be computed in a manner inconsistent with subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">The time-computation provisions of subdivision (a) apply only when a time period must be computed. They do not apply when a fixed time to act is set. The amendments thus carry forward the approach taken in <em>Violette v. P.A. Days, Inc.</em>, 427 F.3d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that Civil Rule 6(a) &ldquo;does not apply to situations where the court has established a specific calendar day as a deadline&rdquo;), and reject the contrary holding of <em>In re American Healthcare Management, Inc.</em>, 900 F.2d 827, 832 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) governs treatment of date-certain deadline set by court order). If, for example, the date for filing is &ldquo;no later than November 1, 2007,&rdquo; subdivision (a) does not govern. But if a filing is required to be made &ldquo;within 10 days&rdquo; or &ldquo;within 72 hours,&rdquo; subdivision (a) describes how that deadline is computed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) does not apply when computing a time period set by a statute if the statute specifies a method of computing time. <em>See, e.g.</em>, 20 U.S.C. &sect;7711(b)(1) (requiring certain petitions for review by a local educational agency or a state to be filed &ldquo;within 30 working days (as determined by the local educational agency or State) after receiving notice of&rdquo; federal agency decision).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1).</em> New subdivision (a)(1) addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in days. It also applies to time periods that are stated in weeks, months, or years; though no such time period currently appears in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, such periods may be set by other covered provisions such as a local rule. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 46.3(c)(1). Subdivision (a)(1)(B)'s directive to &ldquo;count every day&rdquo; is relevant only if the period is stated in days (not weeks, months or years).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under former Rule 26(a), a period of 11 days or more was computed differently than a period of less than 11 days. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays were included in computing the longer periods, but excluded in computing the shorter periods. Former Rule 26(a) thus made computing deadlines unnecessarily complicated and led to counterintuitive results. For example, a 10-day period and a 14-day period that started on the same day usually ended on the same day&mdash;and the 10-day period not infrequently ended later than the 14-day period. <em>See Miltimore Sales, Inc. v. Int'l Rectifier, Inc.</em>, 412 F.3d 685, 686 (6th Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under new subdivision (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days (no matter the length) are computed in the same way. The day of the event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days&mdash;including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays&mdash;are counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. An illustration is provided below in the discussion of subdivision (a)(5). Subdivision (a)(3) addresses filing deadlines that expire on a day when the clerk's office is inaccessible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Where subdivision (a) formerly referred to the &ldquo;act, event, or default&rdquo; that triggers the deadline, new subdivision (a) refers simply to the &ldquo;event&rdquo; that triggers the deadline; this change in terminology is adopted for brevity and simplicity, and is not intended to change meaning.</p>
<p class="note-body">Periods previously expressed as less than 11 days will be shortened as a practical matter by the decision to count intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in computing all periods. Many of those periods have been lengthened to compensate for the change. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Rules 5(b)(2), 5(d)(1), 28.1(f), & 31(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Most of the 10-day periods were adjusted to meet the change in computation method by setting 14 days as the new period. A 14-day period corresponds to the most frequent result of a 10-day period under the former computation method&mdash;two Saturdays and two Sundays were excluded, giving 14 days in all. A 14-day period has an additional advantage. The final day falls on the same day of the week as the event that triggered the period&mdash;the 14th day after a Monday, for example, is a Monday. This advantage of using week-long periods led to adopting 7-day periods to replace some of the periods set at less than 10 days, and 21-day periods to replace 20-day periods. Thirty-day and longer periods, however, were retained without change.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2).</em> New subdivision (a)(2) addresses the computation of time periods that are stated in hours. No such deadline currently appears in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. But some statutes contain deadlines stated in hours, as do some court orders issued in expedited proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (a)(2), a deadline stated in hours starts to run immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the deadline. The deadline generally ends when the time expires. If, however, the time period expires at a specific time (say, 2:17 p.m.) on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline is extended to the same time (2:17 p.m.) on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Periods stated in hours are not to be &ldquo;rounded up&rdquo; to the next whole hour. Subdivision (a)(3) addresses situations when the clerk's office is inaccessible during the last hour before a filing deadline expires.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(2)(B) directs that every hour be counted. Thus, for example, a 72-hour period that commences at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, November 2, 2007, will run until 9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5; the discrepancy in start and end times in this example results from the intervening shift from daylight saving time to standard time.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(3).</em> When determining the last day of a filing period stated in days or a longer unit of time, a day on which the clerk's office is not accessible because of the weather or another reason is treated like a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When determining the end of a filing period stated in hours, if the clerk's office is inaccessible during the last hour of the filing period computed under subdivision (a)(2) then the period is extended to the same time on the next day that is not a weekend, holiday or day when the clerk's office is inaccessible.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:44 --><p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(3)'s extensions apply &ldquo;[u]nless the court orders otherwise.&rdquo; In some circumstances, the court might not wish a period of inaccessibility to trigger a full 24-hour extension; in those instances, the court can specify a briefer extension.</p>
<p class="note-body">The text of the rule no longer refers to &ldquo;weather or other conditions&rdquo; as the reason for the inaccessibility of the clerk's office. The reference to &ldquo;weather&rdquo; was deleted from the text to underscore that inaccessibility can occur for reasons unrelated to weather, such as an outage of the electronic filing system. Weather can still be a reason for inaccessibility of the clerk's office. The rule does not attempt to define inaccessibility. Rather, the concept will continue to develop through caselaw, <em>see, e.g., Tchakmakjian v. Department of Defense</em>, 57 Fed. Appx. 438, 441 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (unpublished per curiam opinion) (inaccessibility &ldquo;due to anthrax concerns&rdquo;); <em>cf</em>. William G. Phelps, <em>When Is Office of Clerk of Court Inaccessible Due to Weather or Other Conditions for Purpose of Computing Time Period for Filing Papers under Rule 6(a) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, 135 A.L.R. Fed. 259 (1996) (collecting cases). In addition, local provisions may address inaccessibility for purposes of electronic filing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4).</em> New subdivision (a)(4) defines the end of the last day of a period for purposes of subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (a)(4) does not apply in computing periods stated in hours under subdivision (a)(2), and does not apply if a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or order in the case. A local rule may, for example, address the problems that might arise under subdivision (a)(4)(A) if a single district has clerk's offices in different time zones, or provide that papers filed in a drop box after the normal hours of the clerk's office are filed as of the day that is date-stamped on the papers by a device in the drop box.</p>
<p class="note-body">28 U.S.C. &sect;452 provides that &ldquo;[a]ll courts of the United States shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and orders.&rdquo; A corresponding provision exists in Rule 45(a)(2). Some courts have held that these provisions permit an after-hours filing by handing the papers to an appropriate official. <em>See, e.g., Casalduc v. Diaz</em>, 117 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1941). Subdivision (a)(4) does not address the effect of the statute on the question of after-hours filing; instead, the rule is designed to deal with filings in the ordinary course without regard to Section 452.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(4)(A) addresses electronic filings in the district court. For example, subdivision (a)(4)(A) would apply to an electronically-filed notice of appeal. Subdivision (a)(4)(B) addresses electronic filings in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(4)(C) addresses filings by mail under Rules 25(a)(2)(B)(i) and 13(b), filings by third-party commercial carrier under Rule 25(a)(2)(B)(ii), and inmate filings under Rules 4(c)(1) and 25(a)(2)(C). For such filings, subdivision (a)(4)(C) provides that the &ldquo;last day&rdquo; ends at the latest time (prior to midnight in the filer's time zone) that the filer can properly submit the filing to the post office, third-party commercial carrier, or prison mail system (as applicable) using the filer's chosen method of submission. For example, if a correctional institution's legal mail system's rules of operation provide that items may only be placed in the mail system between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., then the &ldquo;last day&rdquo; for filings under Rules 4(c)(1) and 25(a)(2)(C) by inmates in that institution ends at 5:00 p.m. As another example, if a filer uses a drop box maintained by a third-party commercial carrier, the &ldquo;last day&rdquo; ends at the time of that drop box's last scheduled pickup. Filings by mail under Rule 13(b) continue to be subject to &sect;7502 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(4)(D) addresses all other non-electronic filings; for such filings, the last day ends under (a)(4)(D) when the clerk's office in which the filing is made is scheduled to close.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5).</em> New subdivision (a)(5) defines the &ldquo;next&rdquo; day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C). The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure contain both forward-looking time periods and backward-looking time periods. A forward-looking time period requires something to be done within a period of time <em>after</em> an event. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Rule 4(a)(1)(A) (subject to certain exceptions, notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed &ldquo;within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered&rdquo;). A backward-looking time period requires something to be done within a period of time <em>before</em> an event. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Rule 31(a)(1) (&ldquo;[A] reply brief must be filed at least 7 days before argument, unless the court, for good cause, allows a later filing.&rdquo;). In determining what is the &ldquo;next&rdquo; day for purposes of subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(C), one should continue counting in the same direction&mdash;that is, forward when computing a forward-looking period and backward when computing a backward-looking period. If, for example, a filing is due within 10 days <em>after</em> an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday, September 1, 2007, then the filing is due on Tuesday, September 4, 2007 (Monday, September 3, is Labor Day). But if a filing is due 10 days <em>before</em> an event, and the tenth day falls on Saturday, September 1, then the filing is due on Friday, August 31. If the clerk's office is inaccessible on August 31, then subdivision (a)(3) extends the filing deadline forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday&mdash;no earlier than Tuesday, September 4.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6).</em> New subdivision (a)(6) defines &ldquo;legal holiday&rdquo; for purposes of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, including the time-computation provisions of subdivision (a). Subdivision (a)(6) continues to include within the definition of &ldquo;legal holiday&rdquo; days that are declared a holiday by the President or Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">For forward-counted periods&mdash;i.e., periods that are measured after an event&mdash;subdivision (a)(6)(C) includes certain state holidays within the definition of legal holidays. However, state legal holidays are not recognized in computing backward-counted periods. For both forward- and backward-counted periods, the rule thus protects those who may be unsure of the effect of state holidays. For forward-counted deadlines, treating state holidays the same as federal holidays extends the deadline. Thus, someone who thought that the federal courts might be closed on a state holiday would be safeguarded against an inadvertent late filing. In contrast, for backward-counted deadlines, not giving state holidays the treatment of federal holidays allows filing on the state holiday itself rather than the day before. Take, for example, Monday, April 21, 2008 (Patriot's Day, a legal holiday in the relevant state). If a filing is due 14 days after an event, and the fourteenth day is April 21, then the filing is due on Tuesday, April 22 because Monday, April 21 counts as a legal holiday. But if a filing is due 14 days before an event, and the fourteenth day is April 21, the filing is due on Monday, April 21; the fact that April 21 is a state holiday does not make April 21 a legal holiday for purposes of computing this backward-counted deadline. But note that if the clerk's office is inaccessible on Monday, April 21, then subdivision (a)(3) extends the April 21 filing deadline forward to the next accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday&mdash;no earlier than Tuesday, April 22.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> To specify that a period should be calculated by counting all intermediate days, including weekends or holidays, the Rules formerly used the term &ldquo;calendar days.&rdquo; Because new subdivision (a) takes a &ldquo;days-are-days&rdquo; approach under which all intermediate days are counted, no matter how short the period, &ldquo;3 calendar days&rdquo; in subdivision (c) is amended to read simply &ldquo;3 days.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 26(c) has been amended to eliminate uncertainty about application of the 3-day rule. Civil Rule 6(e) was amended in 2004 to eliminate similar uncertainty in the Civil Rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment, a party that is required or permitted to act within a prescribed period should first calculate that period, without reference to the 3-day rule provided by Rule 26(c), but with reference to the <!-- PDFPage:45 -->other time computation provisions of the Appellate Rules. After the party has identified the date on which the prescribed period would expire but for the operation of Rule 26(c), the party should add 3 calendar days. The party must act by the third day of the extension, unless that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case the party must act by the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p>
<p class="note-body">To illustrate: A paper is served by mail on Thursday, November 1, 2007. The prescribed time to respond is 30 days. The prescribed period ends on Monday, December 3 (because the 30th day falls on a Saturday, the prescribed period extends to the following Monday). Under Rule 26(c), three calendar days are added&mdash;Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday&mdash;and thus the response is due on Thursday, December 6.</p>
