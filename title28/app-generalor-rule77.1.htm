<p class="note-body">Former RCFC 77.1 was deleted in its entirety. Current RCFC 77.1 reflects portions of the text of former subdivision (c) as well as subdivisions (h) and (i) of RCFC 77.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note&mdash;2005 Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(2) has been revised to conform more precisely to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1926(a) which provides that &ldquo;[t]he Judicial Conference of the United States shall prescribe from time to time the fees and costs to be charged and collected in the United States Court of Federal Claims.&rdquo; This authorization for the Judicial Conference to prescribe fees for the court has a counterpart in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1914 which pertains to fees for district courts. Ordinarily, the Judicial Conference amends the fee schedules for both district courts and this court at the same time. In addition, subdivision (c)(2) recognizes the court's authority to include as an additional admission fee the amount provided for in RCFC 83.1(b)(4). Currently applicable fee schedules are obtainable on the court's website and through a variety of other published sources.</p>
