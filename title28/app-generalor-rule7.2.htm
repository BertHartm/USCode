<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Replies.</strong> Replies to responses or objections shall be filed within 7 days after service of the response or objection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motions Under RCFC 12(b), 12(c), 56 and 56.1.</strong> Responses to these motions shall be filed within 28 days after service of the motion and replies thereto within 14 days after service of the response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Leave of Court.</strong> If the subject filing is pursuant to leave of court on motion by a party, the time for any response shall run from the date of filing and not from the date of service.</p>

Where a cross-motion is filed, the parties shall have the same amount of time to respond and reply to the cross-motion as to an original motion.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note&mdash;2002 and 2003</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 7.2 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 83.2 and, following the court's May 1, 2002, revision of its rules, as RCFC 7.1. The first renumbering of the rule (from RCFC 83.2 to RCFC 7.1) was intended to reflect its more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules; the second renumbering (from RCFC 7.1 to RCFC 7.2) accommodates the court's adoption of FRCP 7.1 effective December 1, 2002, and preserves the consistency in numbering systems between the court's rules and the FRCP.</p>
