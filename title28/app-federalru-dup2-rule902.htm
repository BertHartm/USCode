<h3 class="section-head">Rule 902. Evidence That Is Self-Authenticating</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The following items of evidence are self-authenticating; they require no extrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admitted:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Domestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed.</em> A document that bears:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:432 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state, district, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of the United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of any of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of any entity named above; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a signature purporting to be an execution or attestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Domestic Public Documents That Are Not Sealed but Are Signed and Certified.</em> A document that bears no seal if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it bears the signature of an officer or employee of an entity named in Rule 902(1)(A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) another public officer who has a seal and official duties within that same entity certifies under seal&mdash;or its equivalent&mdash;that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Foreign Public Documents.</em> A document that purports to be signed or attested by a person who is authorized by a foreign country's law to do so. The document must be accompanied by a final certification that certifies the genuineness of the signature and official position of the signer or attester&mdash;or of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness relates to the signature or attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the signature or attestation. The certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If all parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to investigate the document's authenticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause, either:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) order that it be treated as presumptively authentic without final certification; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) allow it to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final certification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Certified Copies of Public Records.</em> A copy of an official record&mdash;or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law&mdash;if the copy is certified as correct by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a certificate that complies with Rule 902(1), (2), or (3), a federal statute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Official Publications.</em> A book, pamphlet, or other publication purporting to be issued by a public authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Newspapers and Periodicals.</em> Printed material purporting to be a newspaper or periodical.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <em>Trade Inscriptions and the Like.</em> An inscription, sign, tag, or label purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and indicating origin, ownership, or control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <em>Acknowledged Documents.</em> A document accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment that is lawfully executed by a notary public or another officer who is authorized to take acknowledgments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <em>Commercial Paper and Related Documents.</em> Commercial paper, a signature on it, and related documents, to the extent allowed by general commercial law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) <em>Presumptions Under a Federal Statute.</em> A signature, document, or anything else that a federal statute declares to be presumptively or prima facie genuine or authentic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) <em>Certified Domestic Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity.</em> The original or a copy of a domestic record that meets the requirements of Rule 803(6)(A)&ndash;(C), as shown by a certification of the custodian or another qualified person that complies with a federal statute or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court. Before the trial or hearing, the proponent must give an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to offer the record&mdash;and must make the record and certification available for inspection&mdash;so that the party has a fair opportunity to challenge them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) <em>Certified Foreign Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity.</em> In a civil case, the original or a copy of a foreign record that meets the requirements of Rule 902(11), modified as follows: the certification, rather than complying with a federal statute or Supreme Court rule, must be signed in a manner that, if falsely made, would subject the maker to a criminal penalty in the country where the certification is signed. The proponent must also meet the notice requirements of Rule 902(11).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">Case law and statutes have, over the years, developed a substantial body of instances in which authenticity is taken as sufficiently established for purposes of admissibility without extrinsic evidence to that effect, sometimes for reasons of policy but perhaps more often because practical considerations reduce the possibility of unauthenticity to a very small dimension. The present rule collects and incorporates these situations, in some instances expanding them to occupy a larger area which their underlying considerations justify. In no instance is the opposite party foreclosed from disputing authenticity.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. The acceptance of documents bearing a public seal and signature, most often encountered in practice in the form of acknowledgments or certificates authenticating copies of public records, is actually of broad application. Whether theoretically based in whole or in part upon judicial notice, the practical underlying considerations are that forgery is a crime and detection is fairly easy and certain. 7 Wigmore &sect;2161, p. 638; California Evidence Code &sect;1452. More than 50 provisions for judicial notice of official seals are contained in the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em>. While statutes are found which raise a presumption of genuineness of purported official signatures in the absence of an official seal, 7 Wigmore &sect;2167; California Evidence Code &sect;1453, the greater ease of effecting a forgery under these circumstances is apparent. Hence this paragraph of the rule calls for authentication by an officer who has a seal. Notarial acts by members of the armed forces and other special situations are covered in paragraph (10).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3</em>) provides a method for extending the presumption of authenticity to foreign official docu<!-- PDFPage:433 -->ments by a procedure of certification. It is derived from Rule 44(a)(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure but is broader in applying to public documents rather than being limited to public records.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em>. The common law and innumerable statutes have recognized the procedure of authenticating copies of public records by certificate. The certificate qualifies as a public document, receivable as authentic when in conformity with paragraph (1), (2), or (3). Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided authentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records. It will be observed that the certification procedure here provided extends only to public records, reports, and recorded documents, all including data compilations, and does not apply to public documents generally. Hence documents provable when presented in original form under paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) may not be provable by certified copy under paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (5)</em>. Dispensing with preliminary proof of the genuineness of purportedly official publications, most commonly encountered in connection with statutes, court reports, rules, and regulations, has been greatly enlarged by statutes and decisions. 5 Wigmore &sect;1684. Paragraph (5), it will be noted, does not confer admissibility upon all official publications; it merely provides a means whereby their authenticity may be taken as established for purposes of admissibility. Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure has been to the same effect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em>. The likelihood of forgery of newspapers or periodicals is slight indeed. Hence no danger is apparent in receiving them. Establishing the authenticity of the publication may, of course, leave still open questions of authority and responsibility for items therein contained. See 7 Wigmore &sect;2150. Cf. 39 U.S.C. &sect;4005(b), public advertisement prima facie evidence of agency of person named, in postal fraud order proceeding; Canadian Uniform Evidence Act, Draft of 1936, printed copy of newspaper prima facie evidence that notices or advertisements were authorized.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (7)</em>. Several factors justify dispensing with preliminary proof of genuineness of commercial and mercantile labels and the like. The risk of forgery is minimal. Trademark infringement involves serious penalties. Great efforts are devoted to inducing the public to buy in reliance on brand names, and substantial protection is given them. Hence the fairness of this treatment finds recognition in the cases. <em>Curtiss Candy Co. v. Johnson</em>, 163 Miss. 426, 141 So. 762 (1932), Baby Ruth candy bar; <em>Doyle v. Continental Baking Co</em>., 262 Mass. 516, 160 N.E. 325 (1928), loaf of bread; <em>Weiner v. Mager & Throne, Inc</em>., 167 Misc. 338, 3 N.Y.S.2d 918 (1938), same. And see W.Va.Code 1966, &sect;47&ndash;3&ndash;5, trade-mark on bottle prima facie evidence of ownership. <em>Contra, Keegan v. Green Giant Co</em>., 150 Me. 283, 110 A.2d 599 (1954); <em>Murphy v. Campbell Soup Co</em>., 62 F.2d 564 (1st Cir. 1933). Cattle brands have received similar acceptance in the western states. Rev.Code Mont.1947, &sect;46&ndash;606; <em>State v. Wolfley</em>, 75 Kan. 406, 89 P. 1046 (1907); Annot., 11 L.R.A. (N.S.) 87. Inscriptions on trains and vehicles are held to be prima facie evidence of ownership or control. <em>Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. Ry. v. Callaghan</em>, 157 Ill. 406, 41 N.E. 909 (1895); 9 Wigmore &sect;2510a. See also the provision of 19 U.S.C. &sect;1615(2) that marks, labels, brands, or stamps indicating foreign origin are prima facie evidence of foreign origin of merchandise.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (8)</em>. In virtually every state, acknowledged title documents are receivable in evidence without further proof. Statutes are collected in 5 Wigmore &sect;1676. If this authentication suffices for documents of the importance of those affecting titles, logic scarcely permits denying this method when other kinds of documents are involved. Instances of broadly inclusive statutes are California Evidence Code &sect;1451 and N.Y.CPLR 4538, McKinney's Consol. Laws 1963.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (9)</em>. Issues of the authenticity of commercial paper in federal courts will usually arise in diversity cases, will involve an element of a cause of action or defense, and with respect to presumptions and burden of proof will be controlled by <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Rule 302, <em>supra</em>. There may, however, be questions of authenticity involving lesser segments of a case or the case may be one governed by federal common law. <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States</em>, 318 U.S. 363, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943). Cf. <em>United States v. Yazell</em>, 382 U.S. 341, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966). In these situations, resort to the useful authentication provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code is provided for. While the phrasing is in terms of &ldquo;general commercial law,&rdquo; in order to avoid the potential complication inherent in borrowing local statutes, today one would have difficulty in determining the general commercial law without referring to the Code. See <em>Williams v. Walker-Thomas-Furniture Co</em>., 121 U.S.App.D.C. 315, 350 F.2d 445 (1965). Pertinent Code provisions are sections 1&ndash;202, 3&ndash;307, and 3&ndash;510, dealing with third-party documents, signatures on negotiable instruments, protests, and statements of dishonor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (10)</em>. The paragraph continues in effect dispensations with preliminary proof of genuineness provided in various Acts of Congress. See, for example, 10 U.S.C. &sect;936, signature, without seal, together with title, prima facie evidence of authenticity of acts of certain military personnel who are given notarial power; 15 U.S.C. &sect;77f(a), signature on SEC registration presumed genuine; 26 U.S.C. &sect;6064, signature to tax return prima facie genuine.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 902(8) as submitted by the Court referred to certificates of acknowledgment &ldquo;under the hand and seal of&rdquo; a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments. The Committee amended the Rule to eliminate the requirement, believed to be inconsistent with the law in some States, that a notary public must affix a seal to a document acknowledged before him. As amended the Rule merely requires that the document be executed in the manner prescribed by State law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved Rule 902(9) as submitted by the Court. With respect to the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;general commercial law&rdquo;, the Committee intends that the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in virtually every State, will be followed generally, but that federal commercial law will apply where federal commercial paper is involved. See <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States</em>, 318 U.S. 363 (1943). Further, in those instances in which the issues are governed by <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), State law will apply irrespective of whether it is the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1988 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">These two sentences were inadvertently eliminated from the 1987 amendments. The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment adds two new paragraphs to the rule on self-authentication. It sets forth a procedure by which parties can authenticate certain records of regularly conducted activity, other than through the testimony of a foundation witness. See the amendment to Rule 803(6). 18 U.S.C. &sect;3505 currently provides a means for certifying foreign records of regularly conducted activity in criminal cases, and this amendment is intended to establish a similar procedure for domestic records, and for foreign records offered in civil cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">A declaration that satisfies 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 would satisfy the declaration requirement of Rule 902(11), as would any comparable certification under oath.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:434 --><p class="note-body">The notice requirement in Rules 902(11) and (12) is intended to give the opponent of the evidence a full opportunity to test the adequacy of the foundation set forth in the declaration.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report&mdash;Proposed Amendment to Rule 902</em>. The Committee made the following changes to the published draft of the proposed amendment to Evidence Rule 902:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text, in accordance with suggestions of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The phrase &ldquo;in a manner complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority&rdquo; was added to proposed Rule 902(11), to provide consistency with Evidence Rule 902(4). The Committee Note was amended to accord with this textual change.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text to provide a uniform construction of the terms &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; and &ldquo;certifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The notice provisions in the text were revised to clarify that the proponent must make both the declaration and the underlying record available for inspection.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2011 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 902 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.</p>
