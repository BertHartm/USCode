<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Domestic Public Documents Under Seal.</em> A document bearing a seal purporting to be that of the United States, or of any State, district, Commonwealth, territory, or insular possession thereof, or the Panama Canal Zone, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or of a political subdivision, department, officer, or agency thereof, and a signature purporting to be an attestation or execution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Domestic Public Documents Not Under Seal.</em> A document purporting to bear the signature in the official capacity of an officer or employee of any entity included in paragraph (1) hereof, having no seal, if a public officer having a seal and having official duties in the district or political subdivision of the officer or employee certifies under seal that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Foreign Public Documents.</em> A document purporting to be executed or attested in an official capacity by a person authorized by the laws of a foreign country to make the execution or attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to the genuineness of the signature and official position (A) of the executing or attesting person, or (B) of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official position relates to the execution or attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position relating to the execution or attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of official documents, the court may, for good cause shown, order that they be treated as presumptively authentic without final certification or permit them to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Certified Copies of Public Records.</em> A copy of an official record or report or entry therein, or of a document authorized by law to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed in a public office, including data compilations in any form, certified as correct by the custodian or other person authorized to make the certification, by certificate complying with paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this rule or complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) <em>Certified Domestic Records of Regularly Conducted Activity.</em> The original or a duplicate of a domestic record of regularly conducted activity that would be admissible under Rule 803(6) if accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian or other qualified person, in a manner complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, certifying that the record&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">Case law and statutes have, over the years, developed a substantial body of instances in which authenticity is taken as sufficiently established for purposes of admissibility without extrinsic evidence to that effect, sometimes for reasons of policy but perhaps more often because practical considerations reduce the possibility of unauthenticity to a very small dimension. The present rule collects and incorporates these situations, in some instances expanding them to occupy a larger area which their underlying considerations justify. In no instance is the opposite party foreclosed from disputing authenticity.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. The acceptance of documents bearing a public seal and signature, most often encountered in practice in the form of acknowledgments or certificates authenticating copies of public records, is actually of broad application. Whether theoretically based in whole or in part upon judicial notice, the practical underlying considerations are that forgery is a crime and detection is fairly easy and certain. 7 Wigmore &sect;2161, p. 638; California Evidence Code &sect;1452. More than 50 provisions for judicial notice of official seals are contained in the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em>. While statutes are found which raise a presumption of genuineness of purported official signatures in the absence of an official seal, 7 Wigmore &sect;2167; California Evidence Code &sect;1453, the greater ease of effecting a forgery under these circumstances is apparent. Hence this paragraph of the rule calls for authentication by an officer who has a seal. Notarial acts by members of the armed forces and other special situations are covered in paragraph (10).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3</em>) provides a method for extending the presumption of authenticity to foreign official documents by a procedure of certification. It is derived from Rule 44(a)(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure but is broader in applying to public documents rather than being limited to public records.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em>. The common law and innumerable statutes have recognized the procedure of authenticating copies of public records by certificate. The certificate qualifies as a public document, receivable as authentic when in conformity with paragraph (1), (2), or (3). Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided authentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records. It will be observed that the certification procedure here provided extends only to public records, reports, and recorded documents, all including data compilations, and does not apply to public documents generally. Hence documents provable when presented in original form under paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) may not be provable by certified copy under paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (5)</em>. Dispensing with preliminary proof of the genuineness of purportedly official publications, most commonly encountered in connection with statutes, court reports, rules, and regulations, has been greatly enlarged by statutes and decisions. 5 Wigmore &sect;1684. Paragraph (5), it will be noted, does not confer admissibility upon all official publications; it merely provides a means whereby their authenticity may be taken as established for purposes of admissibility. Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure has been to the same effect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em>. The likelihood of forgery of newspapers or periodicals is slight indeed. Hence no danger is apparent in receiving them. Establishing the authenticity of the publication may, of course, leave still open questions of authority and responsibility for items therein contained. See 7 Wigmore &sect;2150. Cf. 39 U.S.C. &sect;4005(b), public advertisement prima facie evidence of agency of person named, in postal fraud order proceeding; Canadian Uniform Evidence Act, Draft of 1936, printed copy of newspaper prima facie evidence that notices or advertisements were authorized.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (7)</em>. Several factors justify dispensing with preliminary proof of genuineness of commercial and mercantile labels and the like. The risk of forgery is minimal. Trademark infringement involves serious penalties. Great efforts are devoted to inducing the public to buy in reliance on brand names, and substantial protection is given them. Hence the fairness of this treatment finds recognition in the cases. <em>Curtiss Candy Co. v. Johnson</em>, 163 Miss. 426, 141 So. 762 (1932), Baby Ruth candy bar; <em>Doyle v. Continental Baking Co</em>., 262 Mass. 516, 160 N.E. 325 (1928), loaf of bread; <em>Weiner v. Mager & Throne, Inc</em>., 167 Misc. 338, 3 N.Y.S.2d 918 (1938), same. And see W.Va.Code 1966, &sect;47&ndash;3&ndash;5, trade-mark on bottle prima facie evidence of ownership. <em>Contra, Keegan v. Green Giant Co</em>., 150 Me. 283, 110 A.2d 599 (1954); <em>Murphy v. Campbell Soup Co</em>., 62 F.2d 564 (1st Cir. 1933). Cattle brands have received similar acceptance in the western states. Rev.Code Mont.1947, &sect;46&ndash;606; <em>State v. Wolfley</em>, 75 Kan. 406, 89 P. 1046 (1907); Annot., 11 L.R.A. (N.S.) 87. Inscriptions on trains and vehicles are held to be prima facie evidence of ownership or control. <em>Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. Ry. v. Callaghan</em>, 157 Ill. 406, 41 N.E. 909 (1895); 9 Wigmore &sect;2510a. See also the provision of 19 U.S.C. &sect;1615(2) that marks, labels, brands, or stamps indicating foreign origin are prima facie evidence of foreign origin of merchandise.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (8)</em>. In virtually every state, acknowledged title documents are receivable in evidence without further proof. Statutes are collected in 5 Wigmore &sect;1676. If this authentication suffices for documents of the importance of those affecting titles, logic scarcely permits denying this method when other kinds of documents are involved. Instances of broadly inclusive statutes are California Evidence Code &sect;1451 and N.Y.CPLR 4538, McKinney's Consol. Laws 1963.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (9)</em>. Issues of the authenticity of commercial paper in federal courts will usually arise in diversity cases, will involve an element of a cause of action or defense, and with respect to presumptions and burden of proof will be controlled by <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Rule 302, <em>supra</em>. There may, however, be questions of authenticity involving lesser segments of a case or the case may be one governed by federal common law. <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States</em>, 318 U.S. 363, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943). Cf. <em>United States v. Yazell</em>, 382 U.S. 341, 86 S.Ct. 500, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966). In these situations, resort to the useful authentication provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code is provided for. While the phrasing is in terms of &ldquo;general commercial law,&rdquo; in order to avoid the potential complication inherent in borrowing local statutes, today one would have difficulty in determining the general commercial law without referring to the Code. See <em>Williams v. Walker-Thomas-Furniture Co</em>., 121 U.S.App.D.C. 315, 350 F.2d 445 (1965). Pertinent Code provisions are sections 1&ndash;202, 3&ndash;307, and 3&ndash;510, dealing with third-party documents, signatures on negotiable instruments, protests, and statements of dishonor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (10)</em>. The paragraph continues in effect dispensations with preliminary proof of genuineness provided in various Acts of Congress. See, for example, 10 U.S.C. &sect;936, signature, without seal, together with title, prima facie evidence of authenticity of acts of <!-- PDFPage:420 -->certain military personnel who are given notarial power; 15 U.S.C. &sect;77f(a), signature on SEC registration presumed genuine; 26 U.S.C. &sect;6064, signature to tax return prima facie genuine.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 902(8) as submitted by the Court referred to certificates of acknowledgment &ldquo;under the hand and seal of&rdquo; a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments. The Committee amended the Rule to eliminate the requirement, believed to be inconsistent with the law in some States, that a notary public must affix a seal to a document acknowledged before him. As amended the Rule merely requires that the document be executed in the manner prescribed by State law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved Rule 902(9) as submitted by the Court. With respect to the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;general commercial law&rdquo;, the Committee intends that the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in virtually every State, will be followed generally, but that federal commercial law will apply where federal commercial paper is involved. See <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States</em>, 318 U.S. 363 (1943). Further, in those instances in which the issues are governed by <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), State law will apply irrespective of whether it is the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1988 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">These two sentences were inadvertently eliminated from the 1987 amendments. The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment adds two new paragraphs to the rule on self-authentication. It sets forth a procedure by which parties can authenticate certain records of regularly conducted activity, other than through the testimony of a foundation witness. See the amendment to Rule 803(6). 18 U.S.C. &sect;3505 currently provides a means for certifying foreign records of regularly conducted activity in criminal cases, and this amendment is intended to establish a similar procedure for domestic records, and for foreign records offered in civil cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">A declaration that satisfies 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746 would satisfy the declaration requirement of Rule 902(11), as would any comparable certification under oath.</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice requirement in Rules 902(11) and (12) is intended to give the opponent of the evidence a full opportunity to test the adequacy of the foundation set forth in the declaration.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report&mdash;Proposed Amendment to Rule 902</em>. The Committee made the following changes to the published draft of the proposed amendment to Evidence Rule 902:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text, in accordance with suggestions of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The phrase &ldquo;in a manner complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority&rdquo; was added to proposed Rule 902(11), to provide consistency with Evidence Rule 902(4). The Committee Note was amended to accord with this textual change.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Minor stylistic changes were made in the text to provide a uniform construction of the terms &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; and &ldquo;certifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The notice provisions in the text were revised to clarify that the proponent must make both the declaration and the underlying record available for inspection.</p>
