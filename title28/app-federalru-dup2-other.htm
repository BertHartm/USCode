<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Objection.</em> In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> states the law as generally accepted today. Rulings on evidence cannot be assigned as error unless (1) a substantial right is affected, and (2) the nature of the error was called to the attention of the judge, so as to alert him to the proper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take proper corrective measures. The objection and the offer of proof are the techniques for accomplishing these objectives. For similar provisions see Uniform Rules 4 and 5; California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;353 and 354; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;&sect;60&ndash;404 and 60&ndash;405. The rule does not purport to change the law with respect to harmless error. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2111, F.R.Civ.P. 61, F.R.Crim.P. 52, and decisions construing them. The status of constitutional error as harmless or not is treated in <em>Chapman v. California</em>, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), reh. denied <em>id</em>. 987, 87 S.Ct. 1283, 18 L.Ed.2d 241.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The first sentence is the third sentence of Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure virtually verbatim. Its purpose is to reproduce for <!-- PDFPage:342 -->an appellate court, insofar as possible, a true reflection of what occurred in the trial court. The second sentence is in part derived from the final sentence of Rule 43(c). It is designed to resolve doubts as to what testimony the witness would have in fact given, and, in nonjury cases, to provide the appellate court with material for a possible final disposition of the case in the event of reversal of a ruling which excluded evidence. See 5 Moore's Federal Practice &sect;43.11 (2d ed. 1968). Application is made discretionary in view of the practical impossibility of formulating a satisfactory rule in mandatory terms.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This subdivision proceeds on the supposition that a ruling which excludes evidence in a jury case is likely to be a pointless procedure if the excluded evidence nevertheless comes to the attention of the jury. <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, L.Ed.2d 70 (1968). Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: &ldquo;The court may require the offer to be made out of the hearing of the jury.&rdquo; <em>In re McConnell</em>, 370 U.S. 230, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 8 L.Ed.2d 434 (1962), left some doubt whether questions on which an offer is based must first be asked in the presence of the jury. The subdivision answers in the negative. The judge can foreclose a particular line of testimony and counsel can protect his record without a series of questions before the jury, designed at best to waste time and at worst &ldquo;to waft into the jury box&rdquo; the very matter sought to be excluded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This wording of the plain error principle is from Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. While judicial unwillingness to be constructed by mechanical breakdowns of the adversary system has been more pronounced in criminal cases, there is no scarcity of decisions to the same effect in civil cases. In general, see Campbell, Extent to Which Courts of Review Will Consider Questions Not Properly Raised and Preserved, 7 Wis.L.Rev. 91, 160 (1932); Vestal, Sua Sponte Consideration in Appellate Review, 27 Fordham L.Rev. 477 (1958&ndash;59); 64 Harv.L.Rev. 652 (1951). In the nature of things the application of the plain error rule will be more likely with respect to the admission of evidence than to exclusion, since failure to comply with normal requirements of offers of proof is likely to produce a record which simply does not disclose the error.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment applies to all rulings on evidence whether they occur at or before trial, including so-called &ldquo;<em>in limine</em>&rdquo; rulings. One of the most difficult questions arising from <em>in limine</em> and other evidentiary rulings is whether a losing party must renew an objection or offer of proof when the evidence is or would be offered at trial, in order to preserve a claim of error on appeal. Courts have taken differing approaches to this question. Some courts have held that a renewal at the time the evidence is to be offered at trial is always required. <em>See, e.g., Collins v. Wayne Corp</em>., 621 F.2d 777 (5th Cir. 1980). Some courts have taken a more flexible approach, holding that renewal is not required if the issue decided is one that (1) was fairly presented to the trial court for an initial ruling, (2) may be decided as a final matter before the evidence is actually offered, and (3) was ruled on definitively by the trial judge. <em>See, e.g., Rosenfeld v. Basquiat</em>, 78 F.3d 84 (2d Cir. 1996) (admissibility of former testimony under the Dead Man's Statute; renewal not required). Other courts have distinguished between objections to evidence, which must be renewed when evidence is offered, and offers of proof, which need not be renewed after a definitive determination is made that the evidence is inadmissible. <em>See, e.g., Fusco v. General Motors Corp</em>., 11 F.3d 259 (1st Cir. 1993). Another court, aware of this Committee's proposed amendment, has adopted its approach. <em>Wilson v. Williams</em>, 182 F.3d 562 (7th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Differing views on this question create uncertainty for litigants and unnecessary work for the appellate courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that a claim of error with respect to a definitive ruling is preserved for review when the party has otherwise satisfied the objection or offer of proof requirements of Rule 103(a). When the ruling is definitive, a renewed objection or offer of proof at the time the evidence is to be offered is more a formalism than a necessity. <em>See</em> Fed.R.Civ.P. 46 (formal exceptions unnecessary); Fed.R.Cr.P.51 (same); <em>United States v. Mejia-Alarcon</em>, 995 F.2d 982, 986 (10th Cir. 1993) (&ldquo;Requiring a party to review an objection when the district court has issued a definitive ruling on a matter that can be fairly decided before trial would be in the nature of a formal exception and therefore unnecessary.&rdquo;). On the other hand, when the trial court appears to have reserved its ruling or to have indicated that the ruling is provisional, it makes sense to require the party to bring the issue to the court's attention subsequently. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vest</em>, 116 F.3d 1179, 1188 (7th Cir. 1997) (where the trial court ruled <em>in limine</em> that testimony from defense witnesses could not be admitted, but allowed the defendant to seek leave at trial to call the witnesses should their testimony turn out to be relevant, the defendant's failure to seek such leave at trial meant that it was &ldquo;too late to reopen the issue now on appeal&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Valenti</em>, 60 F.3d 941 (2d Cir. 1995) (failure to proffer evidence at trial waives any claim of error where the trial judge had stated that he would reserve judgment on the <em>in limine</em> motion until he had heard the trial evidence).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment imposes the obligation on counsel to clarify whether an <em>in limine</em> or other evidentiary ruling is definitive when there is doubt on that point. <em>See, e.g., Walden v. Georgia-Pacific Corp</em>., 126 F.3d 506, 520 (3d Cir. 1997) (although &ldquo;the district court told plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel not to reargue every ruling, it did not countermand its clear opening statement that all of its rulings were tentative, and counsel never requested clarification, as he might have done.&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Even where the court's ruling is definitive, nothing in the amendment prohibits the court from revisiting its decision when the evidence is to be offered. If the court changes its initial ruling, or if the opposing party violates the terms of the initial ruling, objection must be made when the evidence is offered to preserve the claim of error for appeal. The error, if any, in such a situation occurs only when the evidence is offered and admitted. <em>United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Olympia Wings, Inc</em>., 896 F.2d 949, 956 (5th Cir. 1990) (&ldquo;objection is required to preserve error when an opponent, or the court itself, violates a motion <em>in limine</em> that was granted&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Roenigk</em>, 810 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1987) (claim of error was not preserved where the defendant failed to object at trial to secure the benefit of a favorable advance ruling).</p>
<p class="note-body">A definitive advance ruling is reviewed in light of the facts and circumstances before the trial court at the time of the ruling. If the relevant facts and circumstances change materially after the advance ruling has been made, those facts and circumstances cannot be relied upon on appeal unless they have been brought to the attention of the trial court by way of a renewed, and timely, objection, offer of proof, or motion to strike. <em>See Old Chief v. United States</em>, 519 U.S. 172, 182, n.6 (1997) (&ldquo;It is important that a reviewing court evaluate the trial court's decision from its perspective when it had to rule and not indulge in review by hindsight.&rdquo;). Similarly, if the court decides in an advance ruling that proffered evidence is admissible subject to the eventual introduction by the proponent of a foundation for the evidence, and that foundation is never provided, the opponent cannot claim error based on the failure to establish the foundation unless the opponent calls that failure to the court's attention by a timely motion to strike or other suitable motion. <em>See Huddleston v. United States</em>, 485 U.S. 681, 690, n.7 (1988) (&ldquo;It is, of course, not the responsibility of the judge <em>sua sponte</em> to ensure that the foundation evidence is offered; the objector must move to strike the evidence if at the close of the trial the offeror has failed to satisfy the condition.&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) or 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1) <!-- PDFPage:343 -->pertaining to nondispositive pretrial rulings by magistrate judges in proceedings that are not before a magistrate judge by consent of the parties. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) provides that a party who fails to file a written objection to a magistrate judge's nondispositive order within ten days of receiving a copy &ldquo;may not thereafter assign as error a defect&rdquo; in the order. 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1) provides that any party &ldquo;may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court&rdquo; within ten days of receiving a copy of the order. Several courts have held that a party must comply with this statutory provision in order to preserve a claim of error. <em>See, e.g., Wells v. Shriners Hospital</em>, 109 F.3d 198, 200 (4th Cir. 1997) (&ldquo;[i]n this circuit, as in others, a party &lsquo;may&rsquo; file objections within ten days or he may not, as he chooses, but he &lsquo;shall&rsquo; do so if he wishes further consideration.&rdquo;). When Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) or 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1) is operative, its requirement must be satisfied in order for a party to preserve a claim of error on appeal, even where Evidence Rule 103(a) would not require a subsequent objection or offer of proof.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the rule set forth in <em>Luce v. United States</em>, 469 U.S. 38 (1984), and its progeny. The amendment provides that an objection or offer of proof need not be renewed to preserve a claim of error with respect to a definitive pretrial ruling. <em>Luce</em> answers affirmatively a separate question: whether a criminal defendant must testify at trial in order to preserve a claim of error predicated upon a trial court's decision to admit the defendant's prior convictions for impeachment. The <em>Luce</em> principle has been extended by many lower courts to other situations. <em>See United States v. DiMatteo</em>, 759 F.2d 831 (11th Cir. 1985) (applying <em>Luce</em> where the defendant's witness would be impeached with evidence offered under Rule 608). <em>See also United States v. Goldman</em>, 41 F.3d 785, 788 (1st Cir. 1994) (&ldquo;Although <em>Luce</em> involved impeachment by conviction under Rule 609, the reasons given by the Supreme Court for requiring the defendant to testify apply with full force to the kind of Rule 403 and 404 objections that are advanced by Goldman in this case.&rdquo;); <em>Palmieri v. DeFaria</em>, 88 F.3d 136 (2d Cir. 1996) (where the plaintiff decided to take an adverse judgment rather than challenge an advance ruling by putting on evidence at trial, the <em>in limine</em> ruling would not be reviewed on appeal); <em>United States v. Ortiz</em>, 857 F.2d 900 (2d Cir. 1988) (where uncharged misconduct is ruled admissible if the defendant pursues a certain defense, the defendant must actually pursue that defense at trial in order to preserve a claim of error on appeal); <em>United States v. Bond</em>, 87 F.3d 695 (5th Cir. 1996) (where the trial court rules <em>in limine</em> that the defendant would waive his fifth amendment privilege were he to testify, the defendant must take the stand and testify in order to challenge that ruling on appeal).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment does not purport to answer whether a party who objects to evidence that the court finds admissible in a definitive ruling, and who then offers the evidence to &ldquo;remove the sting&rdquo; of its anticipated prejudicial effect, thereby waives the right to appeal the trial court's ruling. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fisher</em>, 106 F.3d 622 (5th Cir. 1997) (where the trial judge ruled <em>in limine</em> that the government could use a prior conviction to impeach the defendant if he testified, the defendant did not waive his right to appeal by introducing the conviction on direct examination); <em>Judd v. Rodman</em>, 105 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 1997) (an objection made <em>in limine</em> is sufficient to preserve a claim of error when the movant, as a matter of trial strategy, presents the objectionable evidence herself on direct examination to minimize its prejudicial effect); <em>Gill v. Thomas</em>, 83 F.3d 537, 540 (1st Cir. 1996) (&ldquo;by offering the misdemeanor evidence himself, Gill waived his opportunity to object and thus did not preserve the issue for appeal&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Williams</em>, 939 F.2d 721 (9th Cir. 1991) (objection to impeachment evidence was waived where the defendant was impeached on direct examination).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report&mdash;Proposed Amendment to Rule 103(a)</em>. The Committee made the following changes to the published draft of the proposed amendment to Evidence Rule 103(a):</p>
<p class="note-body">1. A minor stylistic change was made in the text, in accordance with the suggestion of the Style Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The second sentence of the amended portion of the published draft was deleted, and the Committee Note was amended to reflect the fact that nothing in the amendment is intended to affect the rule of <em>Luce v. United States.</em></p>

<p class="note-body">4. The Committee Note was amended to include a reference to a Civil Rule and a statute requiring objections to certain Magistrate Judge rulings to be made to the District Court.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. The Committee Note was revised to clarify that an advance ruling does not encompass subsequent developments at trial that might be the subject of an appeal.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of the Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The applicability of a particular rule of evidence often depends upon the existence of a condition. Is the alleged expert a qualified physician? Is a witness whose former testimony is offered unavailable? Was a stranger present during a conversation between attorney and client? In each instance the admissibility of evidence will turn upon the answer to the question of the existence of the condition. Accepted practice, incorporated in the rule, places on the judge the responsibility for these determinations. McCormick &sect;53; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 45&ndash;50 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">To the extent that these inquiries are factual, the judge acts as a trier of fact. Often, however, rulings on evidence call for an evaluation in terms of a legally set standard. Thus when a hearsay statement is offered as a declaration against interest, a decision must be made whether it possesses the required against-interest characteristics. These decisions, too, are made by the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of these considerations, this subdivision refers to preliminary requirements generally by the <!-- PDFPage:344 -->broad term &ldquo;questions,&rdquo; without attempt at specification.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision is of general application. It must, however, be read as subject to the special provisions for &ldquo;conditional relevancy&rdquo; in subdivision (b) and those for confessions in subdivision (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the question is factual in nature, the judge will of necessity receive evidence pro and con on the issue. The rule provides that the rules of evidence in general do not apply to this process. McCormick &sect;53, p. 123, n. 8, points out that the authorities are &ldquo;scattered and inconclusive,&rdquo; and observes:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Should the exclusionary law of evidence, &lsquo;the child of the jury system&rsquo; in Thayer's phrase, be applied to this hearing before the judge? Sound sense backs the view that it should not, and that the judge should be empowered to hear any relevant evidence, such as affidavits or other reliable hearsay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">This view is reinforced by practical necessity in certain situations. An item, offered and objected to, may itself be considered in ruling on admissibility, though not yet admitted in evidence. Thus the content of an asserted declaration against interest must be considered in ruling whether it is against interest. Again, common practice calls for considering the testimony of a witness, particularly a child, in determining competency. Another example is the requirement of Rule 602 dealing with personal knowledge. In the case of hearsay, it is enough, if the declarant &ldquo;so far as appears [has] had an opportunity to observe the fact declared.&rdquo; McCormick, &sect;10, p. 19.</p>
<p class="note-body">If concern is felt over the use of affidavits by the judge in preliminary hearings on admissibility, attention is directed to the many important judicial determinations made on the basis of affidavits. Rule 47 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;An application to the court for an order shall be by motion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It may be supported by affidavit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The Rules of Civil Procedure are more detailed. Rule 43(e), dealing with motions generally, provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;When a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or depositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Rule 4(g) provides for proof of service by affidavit. Rule 56 provides in detail for the entry of summary judgment based on affidavits. Affidavits may supply the foundation for temporary restraining orders under Rule 65(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The study made for the California Law Revision Commission recommended an amendment to Uniform Rule 2 as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In the determination of the issue aforesaid [preliminary determination], exclusionary rules shall not apply, subject, however, to Rule 45 and any valid claim of privilege.&rdquo; Tentative Recommendation and a Study Relating to the Uniform Rules of Evidence (Article VIII, Hearsay), Cal. Law Revision Comm'n, Rep., Rec. & Studies, 470 (1962). The proposal was not adopted in the California Evidence Code. The Uniform Rules are likewise silent on the subject. However, New Jersey Evidence Rule 8(1), dealing with preliminary inquiry by the judge, provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In his determination the rules of evidence shall not apply except for Rule 4 [exclusion on grounds of confusion, etc.] or a valid claim of privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. In some situations, the relevancy of an item of evidence, in the large sense, depends upon the existence of a particular preliminary fact. Thus when a spoken statement is relied upon to prove notice to X, it is without probative value unless X heard it. Or if a letter purporting to be from Y is relied upon to establish an admission by him, it has no probative value unless Y wrote or authorized it. Relevance in this sense has been labelled &ldquo;conditional relevancy.&rdquo; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 45&ndash;46 (1962). Problems arising in connection with it are to be distinguished from problems of logical relevancy, e.g. evidence in a murder case that accused on the day before purchased a weapon of the kind used in the killing, treated in Rule 401.</p>
<p class="note-body">If preliminary questions of conditional relevancy were determined solely by the judge, as provided in subdivision (a), the functioning of the jury as a trier of fact would be greatly restricted and in some cases virtually destroyed. These are appropriate questions for juries. Accepted treatment, as provided in the rule, is consistent with that given fact questions generally. The judge makes a preliminary determination whether the foundation evidence is sufficient to support a finding of fulfillment of the condition. If so, the item is admitted. If after all the evidence on the issue is in, pro and con, the jury could reasonably conclude that fulfillment of the condition is not established, the issue is for them. If the evidence is not such as to allow a finding, the judge withdraws the matter from their consideration. Morgan, <em>supra</em>; California Evidence Code &sect;403; New Jersey Rule 8(2). See also Uniform Rules 19 and 67.</p>
<p class="note-body">The order of proof here, as generally, is subject to the control of the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Preliminary hearings on the admissibility of confessions must be conducted outside the hearing of the jury. See <em>Jackson v. Denno</em>, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). Otherwise, detailed treatment of when preliminary matters should be heard outside the hearing of the jury is not feasible. The procedure is time consuming. Not infrequently the same evidence which is relevant to the issue of establishment of fulfillment of a condition precedent to admissibility is also relevant to weight or credibility, and time is saved by taking foundation proof in the presence of the jury. Much evidence on preliminary questions, though not relevant to jury issues, may be heard by the jury with no adverse effect. A great deal must be left to the discretion of the judge who will act as the interests of justice require.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The limitation upon cross-examination is designed to encourage participation by the accused in the determination of preliminary matters. He may testify concerning them without exposing himself to cross-examination generally. The provision is necessary because of the breadth of cross-examination under Rule 611(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not address itself to questions of the subsequent use of testimony given by an accused at a hearing on a preliminary matter. See <em>Walder v. United States</em>, 347 U.S. 62 (1954): <em>Simmons v. United States</em>, 390 U.S. 377 (1968): <em>Harris v. New York</em>, 401 U.S. 222 (1971)</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. For similar provisions see Uniform Rule 8; California Evidence Code &sect;406; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;408; New Jersey Evidence Rule 8(1).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 104(c) as submitted to the Congress provided that hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall be conducted outside the presence of the jury and hearings on all other preliminary matters should be so conducted when the interests of justice require. The Committee amended the Rule to provide that where an accused is a witness as to a preliminary matter, he has the right, upon his request, to be heard outside the jury's presence. Although recognizing that in some cases duplication of evidence would occur and that the procedure could be subject to abuse, the Committee believed that a proper regard for the right of an accused not to testify generally in the case dictates that he be given an option to testify out of the presence of the jury on preliminary matters.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee construes the second sentence of subdivision (c) as applying to civil actions and proceedings as well as to criminal cases, and on this assumption has left the sentence unamended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under rule 104(c) the hearing on a preliminary matter may at times be conducted in front of the jury. Should an accused testify in such a hearing, waiving his privilege against self-incrimination as to the preliminary <!-- PDFPage:345 -->issue, rule 104(d) provides that he will not generally be subject to cross-examination as to any other issue. This rule is not, however, intended to immunize the accused from cross-examination where, in testifying about a preliminary issue, he injects other issues into the hearing. If he could not be cross-examined about any issues gratuitously raised by him beyond the scope of the preliminary matters, injustice result. Accordingly, in order to prevent any such unjust result, the committee intends the rule to be construed to provide that the accused may subject himself to cross-examination as to issues raised by his own testimony upon a preliminary matter before a jury.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">A close relationship exists between this rule and Rule 403 which requires exclusion when &ldquo;probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.&rdquo; The present rule recognizes the practice of admitting evidence for a limited purpose and instructing the jury accordingly. The availability and effectiveness of this practice must be taken into consideration in reaching a decision whether to exclude for unfair prejudice under Rule 403. In <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, 19 L.Ed.2d 70 (1968), the Court ruled that a limiting instruction did not effectively protect the accused against the prejudicial effect of admitting in evidence the confession of a codefendant which implicated him. The decision does not, however, bar the use of limited admissibility with an instruction where the risk of prejudice is less serious.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 6; California Evidence Code &sect;355; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;406; New Jersey Evidence Rule 6. The wording of the present rule differs, however, in repelling any implication that limiting or curative instructions are sufficient in all situations.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 106 as submitted by the Supreme Court (now Rule 105 in the bill) dealt with the subject of evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but is not admissible against another party or for another purpose.

<p class="note-body">The rule is based on two considerations. The first is the misleading impression created by taking matters out of context. The second is the inadequacy of repair work when delayed to a point later in the trial. See McCormick &sect;56; California Evidence Code &sect;356. The rule does not in any way circumscribe the right of the adversary to develop the matter on cross-examination or as part of his own case.</p>
