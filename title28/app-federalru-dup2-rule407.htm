<h3 class="section-head">Rule 407. Subsequent Remedial Measures</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">When, after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event, measures are taken that, if taken previously, would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in a product, a defect in a product's design, or a need for a warning or instruction. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule incorporates conventional doctrine which excludes evidence of subsequent remedial measures as proof of an admission of fault. The rule rests on two grounds. (1) The conduct is not in fact an admission, since the conduct is equally consistent with injury by mere accident or through contributory negligence. Or, as Baron Bramwell put it, the rule rejects the notion that &ldquo;because the world gets wiser as it gets older, therefore it was foolish before.&rdquo; <em>Hart v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co</em>., 21 L.T.R. N.S. 261, 263 (1869). Under a liberal theory of relevancy this ground alone would not support exclusion as the inference is still a possible one. (2) The other, and more impressive, ground for exclusion rests on a social policy of encouraging people to take, or at least not discouraging them from taking, steps in furtherance of added safety. The courts have applied this principle to exclude evidence of subsequent repairs, installation of safety devices, changes in company rules, and discharge of employees, and the language of the present rules is broad enough to encompass all of them. See Falknor, Extrinsic Policies Affecting Admissibility, 10 Rutgers L.Rev. 574, 590 (1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of the rule directs attention to the limitations of the rule. Exclusion is called for only when the evidence of subsequent remedial measures is offered as proof of negligence or culpable conduct. In effect it rejects the suggested inference that fault is admitted. Other purposes are, however, allowable, including ownership or control, existence of duty, and feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, and impeachment. 2 Wigmore &sect;283; Annot., 64 A.L.R.2d 1296. Two recent federal cases are illustrative. <em>Boeing Airplane Co. v. Brown</em>, 291 F.2d 310 (9th Cir. 1961), an action against an airplane manufacturer for using an allegedly defectively designed alternator shaft which caused a <!-- PDFPage:345 -->plane crash, upheld the admission of evidence of subsequent design modification for the purpose of showing that design changes and safeguards were feasible. And <em>Powers v. J. B. Michael & Co</em>., 329 F.2d 674 (6th Cir. 1964), an action against a road contractor for negligent failure to put out warning signs, sustained the admission of evidence that defendant subsequently put out signs to show that the portion of the road in question was under defendant's control. The requirement that the other purpose be controverted calls for automatic exclusion unless a genuine issue be present and allows the opposing party to lay the groundwork for exclusion by making an admission. Otherwise the factors of undue prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, and waste of time remain for consideration under Rule 403.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 407 makes two changes in the rule. First, the words &ldquo;an injury or harm allegedly caused by&rdquo; were added to clarify that the rule applies only to changes made after the occurrence that produced the damages giving rise to the action. Evidence of measures taken by the defendant prior to the &ldquo;event&rdquo; causing &ldquo;injury or harm&rdquo; do not fall within the exclusionary scope of Rule 407 even if they occurred after the manufacture or design of the product. See <em>Chase v. General Motors Corp.</em>, 856 F.2d 17, 21&ndash;22 (4th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, Rule 407 has been amended to provide that evidence of subsequent remedial measures may not be used to prove &ldquo;a defect in a product or its design, or that a warning or instruction should have accompanied a product.&rdquo; This amendment adopts the view of a majority of the circuits that have interpreted Rule 407 to apply to products liability actions. See <em>Raymond v. Raymond Corp</em>., 938 F.2d 1518, 1522 (1st Cir. 1991); <em>In re Joint Eastern District and Southern District Asbestos Litigation v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc.</em>, 995 F.2d 343 (2d Cir. 1993); <em>Cann v. Ford Motor Co.</em>, 658 F.2d 54, 60 (2d Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied</em>, 456 U.S. 960 (1982); <em>Kelly v. Crown Equipment Co.</em>, 970 F.2d 1273, 1275 (3d Cir. 1992); <em>Werner v. Upjohn, Inc.</em>, 628 F.2d 848 (4th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied</em>, 449 U.S. 1080 (1981); <em>Grenada Steel Industries, Inc. v. Alabama Oxygen Co., Inc.</em>, 695 F.2d 883 (5th Cir. 1983); <em>Bauman v. Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft</em>, 621 F.2d 230, 232 (6th Cir. 1980); <em>Flaminio v. Honda Motor Company, Ltd.</em>, 733 F.2d 463, 469 (7th Cir. 1984); <em>Gauthier v. AMF, Inc.</em>, 788 F.2d 634, 636&ndash;37 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although this amendment adopts a uniform federal rule, it should be noted that evidence of subsequent remedial measures may be admissible pursuant to the second sentence of Rule 407. Evidence of subsequent measures that is not barred by Rule 407 may still be subject to exclusion on Rule 403 grounds when the dangers of prejudice or confusion substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 407</em>. The words &ldquo;injury or harm&rdquo; were substituted for the word &ldquo;event&rdquo; in line 3. The stylization changes in the second sentence of the rule were eliminated. The words &ldquo;causing &lsquo;injury or harm&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; were added to the Committee Note.</p>
