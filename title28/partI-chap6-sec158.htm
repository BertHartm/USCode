<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">to have such appeal heard by the district court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An appeal under subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be taken in the same manner as appeals in civil proceedings generally are taken to the courts of appeals from the district courts and in the time provided by Rule 8002 of the Bankruptcy Rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees entered under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the judgment, order, or decree involves a question of law as to which there is no controlling decision of the court of appeals for the circuit or of the Supreme Court of the United States, or involves a matter of public importance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the judgment, order, or decree involves a question of law requiring resolution of conflicting decisions; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The parties may supplement the certification with a short statement of the basis for the certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) An appeal under this paragraph does not stay any proceeding of the bankruptcy court, the district court, or the bankruptcy appellate panel from which the appeal is taken, unless the respective bankruptcy court, district court, or bankruptcy appellate panel, or the court of appeals in which the appeal in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#158_2_target" name="158_2">2</a></sup> pending, issues a stay of such proceeding pending the appeal.</p>
