<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5. Serving and Filing of Pleadings and Other Papers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Service: When Required.</strong> Except as otherwise provided in these rules, every order required by its terms to be served, every pleading subsequent to the original complaint unless the court otherwise orders, every paper relating to discovery required to be served upon a party unless the court otherwise orders, every written motion, and every written notice, appearance, demand, offer of judgment, designation of record on appeal, and similar paper shall be served upon each of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Making Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Service under RCFC 5(a) and 77(d) on a party represented by an attorney is made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Service under RCFC 5(a) is made by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Delivering a copy to the person served by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(i)</strong> handing it to the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ii)</strong> leaving it at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge, or if no one is in charge leaving it in a conspicuous place in the office; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iii)</strong> if the person has no office or the office is closed, leaving it at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion residing there.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Mailing a copy to the last known address of the person served. Service by mail is complete on mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> If the person served has no known address, leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> Delivering a copy by any other means, including electronic means, consented to in writing by the person served. Service by electronic means is complete on transmission; service by other consented means is complete when the person making service delivers the copy to the agency designated to make delivery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Service by electronic means under RCFC 5(b)(2)(D) is not effective if the party making service learns that the attempted service did not reach the person to be served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> Same: Numerous Defendants. [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Filing; Certificate of Service.</strong> All papers after the complaint required to be served upon a party, together with a certificate of service, must be filed with the court within a reasonable time after service, but disclosures under RCFC 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until <!-- PDFPage:409 -->they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: (i) depositions, (ii) interrogatories, (iii) requests for documents or to permit entry upon land, and (iv) requests for admission, except that depositions upon oral examination and notices thereof, written questions, interrogatories, requests for documents, requests for admission, and answers and responses thereto, and other related discovery materials shall not be filed unless on order of the court. See RCFC 83.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Filing With the Court Defined.</strong> The filing of papers with the court as required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court, except that the judge may permit the papers to be filed with the judge, in which event the judge shall note thereon the filing date and forthwith transmit them to the clerk's office. The court may by an amendment to these rules permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance with such amendment constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules. The clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The changes made to RCFC 5 were intended to bring the rule into closer conformity with FRCP 5. Thus, in addition to a change in sequence, changes in text include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the text of subdivision (b) has been modified to reflect the December 1, 2001, changes to the FRCP which significantly affect organization and which also make possible consensual service by electronic means. In addition, the clause &ldquo;but filing is not&rdquo; has been deleted from the last sentence of that subdivision. The deleted language was not in conformity with the FRCP. Filing is not complete on mailing; filing is controlled by subdivisions (d) and (e) of this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, subdivision (e) adopts the language of the FRCP recognizing the appropriateness of permitting papers to be &ldquo;filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes.&rdquo; <em>It should be noted that no decision has yet been made by the court to implement electronic filing. Such a decision, when made, will be accomplished through an amendment to the rules. Until the issuance of such amendment, the clerk's office will not accept electronic filings. Individual chambers, however, may allow counsel to transmit &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; copies of filed documents by electronic means.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Third, subdivision (e) also adds the final sentence from FRCP 5(e) stating that &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules.&rdquo; The addition of this language to the rule was not intended to alter the court's practice of treating all non-conforming complaints as filed upon receipt in the clerk's office while referring other non-conforming papers received in the clerk's office to a judge for instructions as to whether to permit their filing or to require counsel's correction of the papers&rsquo; defects.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, former subdivision (e) titled, &ldquo;Proof of Service,&rdquo; no longer appears in FRCP 5. In order to conform more closely to FRCP 5, former subdivision (e) was deleted from this rule and now appears as RCFC 5.1.</p>
