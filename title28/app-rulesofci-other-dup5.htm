<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Right Preserved.</cap-smallcap> The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution&mdash;or as provided by a federal statute&mdash;is preserved to the parties inviolate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Demand.</cap-smallcap> On any issue triable of right by a jury, a party may demand a jury trial by:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:224 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) serving the other parties with a written demand&mdash;which may be included in a pleading&mdash;no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) filing the demand in accordance with Rule 5(d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Specifying Issues.</cap-smallcap> In its demand, a party may specify the issues that it wishes to have tried by a jury; otherwise, it is considered to have demanded a jury trial on all the issues so triable. If the party has demanded a jury trial on only some issues, any other party may&mdash;within 14 days after being served with the demand or within a shorter time ordered by the court&mdash;serve a demand for a jury trial on any other or all factual issues triable by jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Waiver; Withdrawal.</cap-smallcap> A party waives a jury trial unless its demand is properly served and filed. A proper demand may be withdrawn only if the parties consent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Admiralty and Maritime Claims.</cap-smallcap> These rules do not create a right to a jury trial on issues in a claim that is an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule provides for the preservation of the constitutional right of trial by jury as directed in the enabling act (act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;723c [see 2072]), and it and the next rule make definite provision for claim and waiver of jury trial, following the method used in many American states and in England and the British Dominions. Thus the claim must be made at once on initial pleading or appearance under Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;188; 6 Tenn.Code Ann. (Williams, 1934) &sect;8734; compare Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>When a Demand Is Made.</cap-smallcap> When a jury trial has been demanded under Rule 38, the action must be designated on the docket as a jury action. The trial on all issues so demanded must be by jury unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the parties or their attorneys file a stipulation to a nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the court, on motion or on its own, finds that on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a jury trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>When No Demand Is Made.</cap-smallcap> Issues on which a jury trial is not properly demanded are to be tried by the court. But the court may, on motion, order a jury trial on any issue for which a jury might have been demanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advisory Jury; Jury Trial by Consent.</cap-smallcap> In an action not triable of right by a jury, the court, on motion or on its own:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may try any issue with an advisory jury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may, with the parties&rsquo; consent, try any issue by a jury whose verdict has the same effect as if a jury trial had been a matter of right, unless the action is against the United States and a federal statute provides for a nonjury trial.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provisions for express waiver of jury trial found in U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;773 (Trial of issues of fact; by court) are incorporated in this rule. See rule 38, however, which extends the provisions for waiver of jury. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;772 (Trial of issues of fact; in equity in patent causes) is unaffected by this rule. When certain of the issues are to be tried by jury and others by the court, the court may determine the sequence in which such issues shall be tried. See <em>Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat. Bank</em>, 260 U.S. 235 (1922).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Voluntary Dismissal.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>By the Plaintiff.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Without a Court Order.</em> Subject to Rules 23(e), 23.1(c), 23.2, and 66 and any applicable federal statute, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Effect.</em> Unless the notice or stipulation states otherwise, the dismissal is without prejudice. But if the plaintiff previously dismissed any federal- or state-court action based on or including the same claim, a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>By Court Order; Effect.</em> Except as provided in Rule 41(a)(1), an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper. If a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action may be dismissed over the defendant's objection only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication. Unless the order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph (2) is without prejudice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Involuntary Dismissal; Effect.</cap-smallcap> If the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it. Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (b) and any dismissal not under this rule&mdash;except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19&mdash;operates as an adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Dismissing a Counterclaim, Crossclaim, or Third-Party Claim.</cap-smallcap> This rule applies to a dismissal of any counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim. A claimant's voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) must be made:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) before a responsive pleading is served; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is introduced at a hearing or trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Costs of a Previously Dismissed Action.</cap-smallcap> If a plaintiff who previously dismissed an action in any court files an action based on or including the same claim against the same defendant, the court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may order the plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs of that previous action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may stay the proceedings until the plaintiff has complied.</p>

<p class="note-body">Provisions regarding dismissal in such statutes as U.S.C., Title 8, &sect;164 [see 1329] (Jurisdiction of district courts in immigration cases) and U.S.C., Title 31, &sect;232 [now 3730] (Liability of persons making false claims against United States; suits) are preserved by paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. This provides for the equivalent of a nonsuit on motion by the defendant after the completion of the presentation of evidence by the plaintiff. Also, for actions tried without a jury, it provides the equivalent of the directed verdict practice for jury actions which is regulated by Rule 50.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The insertion of the reference to Rule 66 correlates Rule 41(a)(1) with the express provisions concerning dismissal set forth in amended Rule 66 on receivers.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:226 --><p class="note-body">The change in Rule 41(a)(1)(i) gives the service of a motion for summary judgment by the adverse party the same effect in preventing unlimited dismissal as was originally given only to the service of an answer. The omission of reference to a motion for summary judgment in the original rule was subject to criticism. 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 3037&ndash;3038, n. 12. A motion for summary judgment may be forthcoming prior to answer, and if well taken will eliminate the necessity for an answer. Since such a motion may require even more research and preparation than the answer itself, there is good reason why the service of the motion, like that of the answer, should prevent a voluntary dismissal by the adversary without court approval.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; has been stricken from Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) in order to avoid confusion and to conform with the elimination of the necessity for special appearances by original Rule 12(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. In some cases tried without a jury, where at the close of plaintiff's evidence the defendant moves for dismissal under Rule 41(b) on the ground that plaintiff's evidence is insufficient for recovery, the plaintiff's own evidence may be conflicting or present questions of credibility. In ruling on the defendant's motion, questions arise as to the function of the judge in evaluating the testimony and whether findings should be made if the motion is sustained. Three circuits hold that as the judge is the trier of the facts in such a situation his function is not the same as on a motion to direct a verdict, where the jury is the trier of the facts, and that the judge in deciding such a motion in a non-jury case may pass on conflicts of evidence and credibility, and if he performs that function of evaluating the testimony and grants the motion on the merits, findings are required. <em>Young v. United States</em> (C.C.A.9th, 1940) 111 F.(2d) 823; <em>Gary Theatre Co. v. Columbia Pictures Corporation</em> (C.C.A.7th, 1941) 120 F.(2d) 891; <em>Bach v. Friden Calculating Machine Co., Inc</em>. (C.C.A.6th, 1945) 148 F.(2d) 407. <em>Cf. Mateas v. Fred Harvey, a Corporation</em> (C.C.A.9th, 1945) 146 F.(2d) 989. The Third Circuit has held that on such a motion the function of the court is the same as on a motion to direct in a jury case, and that the court should only decide whether there is evidence which would support a judgment for the plaintiff, and, therefore, findings are not required by Rule 52. <em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Mason</em> (C.C.A.3d, 1940) 115 F.(2d) 548; <em>Schad v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp</em>. (C.C.A.3d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 991. The added sentence in Rule 41(b) incorporates the view of the Sixth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits. See also 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) Cum. Supplement &sect;41.03, under &ldquo;Page 3045&rdquo;; Commentary, <em>The Motion to Dismiss in Non-Jury Cases</em> (1946) 9 Fed.Rules Serv., Comm.Pg. 41b.14.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the present text of the second sentence of this subdivision, the motion for dismissal at the close of the plaintiff's evidence may be made in a case tried to a jury as well as in a case tried without a jury. But, when made in a jury-tried case, this motion overlaps the motion for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a), which is also available in the same situation. It has been held that the standard to be applied in deciding the Rule 41(b) motion at the close of the plaintiff's evidence in a jury-tried case is the same as that used upon a motion for a directed verdict made at the same stage; and, just as the court need not make findings pursuant to Rule 52(a) when it directs a verdict, so in a jury-tried case it may omit these findings in granting the Rule 41(b) motion. See generally <em>O'Brien v. Westinghouse Electric Corp</em>., 293 F.2d 1, 5&ndash;10 (3d Cir. 1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">As indicated by the discussion in the <em>O'Brien</em> case, the overlap has caused confusion. Accordingly, the second and third sentences of Rule 41(b) are amended to provide that the motion for dismissal at the close of the plaintiff's evidence shall apply only to nonjury cases (including cases tried with an advisory jury). Hereafter the correct motion in jury-tried cases will be the motion for a directed verdict. This involves no change of substance. It should be noted that the court upon a motion for a directed verdict may in appropriate circumstances deny that motion and grant instead a new trial, or a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2). See 6 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &sect;59.08[5] (2d ed. 1954); <em>cf. Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co</em>., 330 U.S. 212, 217, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of Rule 41(b), providing for dismissal for failure to prosecute or to comply with the Rules or any order of court, and the general provisions of the last sentence remain applicable in jury as well as nonjury cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of the last sentence of Rule 41(b) indicates that a dismissal for lack of an indispensable party does not operate as an adjudication on the merits. Such a dismissal does not bar a new action, for it is based merely &ldquo;on a plaintiff's failure to comply with a precondition requisite to the Court's going forward to determine the merits of his substantive claim.&rdquo; See <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 365 U.S. 265, 284&ndash;288, 81 S.Ct. 534, 5 L.Ed.2d 551 & n. 5 (1961); <em>Mallow v. Hinde</em>, 12 Wheat. (25 U.S.) 193, 6 L.Ed. 599 (1827); Clark, <em>Code Pleading</em> 602 (2d ed. 1947); <em>Restatement of Judgments</em> &sect;49, comm. a, b (1942). This amendment corrects an omission from the rule and is consistent with an earlier amendment, effective in 1948, adding &ldquo;the defense of failure to join an indispensable party&rdquo; to clause (1) of Rule 12(h).</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Language is deleted that authorized the use of this rule as a means of terminating a non-jury action on the merits when the plaintiff has failed to carry a burden of proof in presenting the plaintiff's case. The device is replaced by the new provisions of Rule 52(c), which authorize entry of judgment against the defendant as well as the plaintiff, and earlier than the close of the case of the party against whom judgment is rendered. A motion to dismiss under Rule 41 on the ground that a plaintiff's evidence is legally insufficient should now be treated as a motion for judgment on partial findings as provided in Rule 52(c).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 41 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">When Rule 23 was amended in 1966, Rules 23.1 and 23.2 were separated from Rule 23. Rule 41(a)(1) was not then amended to reflect the Rule 23 changes. In 1968 Rule 41(a)(1) was amended to correct the cross-reference to what had become Rule 23(e), but Rules 23.1 and 23.2 were inadvertently overlooked. Rules 23.1 and 23.2 are now added to the list of exceptions in Rule 41(a)(1)(A). This change does not affect established meaning. Rule 23.2 explicitly incorporates Rule 23(e), and thus was already absorbed directly into the exceptions in Rule 41(a)(1). Rule 23.1 requires court approval of a compromise or dismissal in language parallel to Rule 23(e) <!-- PDFPage:227 -->and thus supersedes the apparent right to dismiss by notice of dismissal.</p>

<p class="note-body">In certain suits in admiralty separation for trial of the issues of liability and damages (or of the extent of liability other than damages, such as salvage and general average) has been conducive to expedition and economy, especially because of the statutory right to interlocutory appeal in admiralty cases (which is of course preserved by these Rules). While separation of issues for trial is not to be routinely ordered, it is important that it be encouraged where experience has demonstrated its worth. Cf. Weinstein, <em>Routine Bifurcation of Negligence Trials</em>, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 831 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">In cases (including some cases within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction) in which the parties have a constitutional or statutory right of trial by jury, separation of issues may give rise to problems. See <em>e.g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. Wiener</em>, 286 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1961). Accordingly, the proposed change in Rule 42 reiterates the mandate of Rule 38 respecting preservation of the right to jury trial.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. The first sentence is a restatement of the substance of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;635 (Proof in common-law actions), &sect;637 [see 2072, 2073] (Proof in equity and admiralty), and [former] Equity Rule 46 (Trial&mdash;Testimony Usually Taken in Open Court&mdash;Rulings on Objections to Evidence). This rule abolishes in patent and trade-mark actions, the practice under [former] Equity Rule 48 of setting forth in affidavits the testimony in chief of expert witnesses whose testimony is directed to matters of opinion. The second and third sentences on admissibility of evidence and <em>Subdivision (b)</em> on contradiction and cross-examination modify U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;725 [now 1652] (Laws of states as rules of decision) insofar as that statute has been construed to prescribe conformity to state rules of evidence. Compare Callihan and Ferguson, <em>Evidence and the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, 45 Yale L.J. 622 (1936), and <em>Same: 2</em>, 47 Yale L.J. 195 (1937).

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Supplementary Note Regarding Rules 43 and 44</h4>
<p class="note-body">These rules have been criticized and suggested improvements offered by commentators. 1 <em>Wigmore on Evidence</em> (3d ed. 1940) 200&ndash;204; Green, <em>The Admissibility of Evidence Under the Federal Rules</em> (1941) 55 Harv.L.Rev. 197. Cases indicate, however, that the rule is working better than these commentators had expected. <em>Boerner v. United States</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1941) 117 F.(2d) 387, cert. den. (1941) 313 U.S. 587; <em>Mosson v. Liberty Fast Freight Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 124 F.(2d) 448; <em>Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v.

While consideration of a comprehensive and detailed set of rules of evidence seems very desirable, it has not been feasible for the Committee so far to undertake this important task. Such consideration should include the adaptability to federal practice of all or parts of the proposed Code of Evidence of the American Law Institute.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This new subdivision authorizes the court to appoint interpreters (including interpreters for the deaf), to provide for their compensation, and to tax the compensation as costs. Compare proposed subdivision (b) of Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 43, entitled Evidence, has heretofore served as the basic rule of evidence for civil cases in federal courts. Its very general provisions are superseded by the detailed provisions of the new Rules of Evidence. The original title and many of the provisions of the rule are, therefore, no longer appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The provision for taking testimony in open court is not duplicated in the Rules of Evidence and is retained. Those dealing with admissibility of evidence and competency of witnesses, however, are no longer needed or appropriate since those topics are covered at large in the Rules of Evidence. They are accordingly deleted. The language is broadened, however, to take account of acts of Congress dealing with the taking of testimony, as well as of the Rules of Evidence and any other rules adopted by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The subdivision is no longer needed or appropriate since the matters with which it deals are treated in the Rules of Evidence. The use of leading questions, both generally and in the interrogation of an adverse party or witness identified with him, is the subject of Evidence Rule 611(c). Who may impeach is treated in Evidence Rule 601 and scope of cross-examination is covered in Evidence Rule 611(b). The subdivision is accordingly deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Offers of proof and making a record of excluded evidence are treated in Evidence Rule 103. The subdivision is no longer needed or appropriate and is deleted.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 43(a) is revised to conform to the style conventions adopted for simplifying the present Civil Rules. The only intended changes of meaning are described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that testimony be taken &ldquo;orally&rdquo; is deleted. The deletion makes it clear that testimony of a witness may be given in open court by other means if the witness is not able to communicate orally. Writing or sign language are common examples. The development of advanced technology may enable testimony to be given by other means. A witness unable to sign or write by hand may be able to communicate through a computer or similar device.</p>
<p class="note-body">Contemporaneous transmission of testimony from a different location is permitted only on showing good cause in compelling circumstances. The importance of presenting live testimony in court cannot be forgotten. The very ceremony of trial and the presence of the factfinder may exert a powerful force for truthtelling. The opportunity to judge the demeanor of a witness face-to-face is accorded great value in our tradition. Transmission cannot be justified merely by showing that it is inconvenient for the witness to attend the trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The most persuasive showings of good cause and compelling circumstances are likely to arise when a witness is unable to attend trial for unexpected reasons, such as accident or illness, but remains able to testify from a different place. Contemporaneous transmission may be better than an attempt to reschedule the trial, particularly if there is a risk that other&mdash;and perhaps more important&mdash;witnesses might not be available at a later time.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other possible justifications for remote transmission must be approached cautiously. Ordinarily depositions, including video depositions, provide a superior means of securing the testimony of a witness who is beyond the reach of a trial subpoena, or of resolving difficulties in scheduling a trial that can be attended by all witnesses. Deposition procedures ensure the opportunity of all parties to be represented while the witness is testifying. An unforeseen need for the testimony of a remote witness that arises during trial, however, may establish good cause and compelling circumstances. Justification is particularly likely if the need arises from the interjection of new issues during trial or from the unexpected inability to present testimony as planned from a different witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">Good cause and compelling circumstances may be established with relative ease if all parties agree that testimony should be presented by transmission. The court is not bound by a stipulation, however, and can insist on live testimony. Rejection of the parties&rsquo; agreement will be influenced, among other factors, by the apparent importance of the testimony in the full context of the trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">A party who could reasonably foresee the circumstances offered to justify transmission of testimony will have special difficulty in showing good cause and the compelling nature of the circumstances. Notice of a desire to transmit testimony from a different location should be given as soon as the reasons are known, to enable other parties to arrange a deposition, or to secure an advance ruling on transmission so as to know whether to prepare to be present with the witness while testifying.</p>
<p class="note-body">No attempt is made to specify the means of transmission that may be used. Audio transmission without video images may be sufficient in some circumstances, particularly as to less important testimony. Video transmission ordinarily should be preferred when the cost is reasonable in relation to the matters in dispute, the means of the parties, and the circumstances that justify transmission. Transmission that merely produces the equivalent of a written statement ordinarily should not be used.</p>
<p class="note-body">Safeguards must be adopted that ensure accurate identification of the witness and that protect against influence by persons present with the witness. Accurate transmission likewise must be assured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other safeguards should be employed to ensure that advance notice is given to all parties of foreseeable circumstances that may lead the proponent to offer testimony by transmission. Advance notice is important to protect the opportunity to argue for attendance of the witness at trial. Advance notice also ensures an opportunity to depose the witness, perhaps by video record, as a means of supplementing transmitted testimony.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Domestic Record.</em> Each of the following evidences an official record&mdash;or an entry in it&mdash;that is otherwise admissible and is kept within the United States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an official publication of the record; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a copy attested by the officer with legal custody of the record&mdash;or by the officer's deputy&mdash;and accompanied by a certificate that the officer has custody. The certificate must be made under seal:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by a judge of a court of record in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Foreign Record.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>In General.</em> Each of the following evidences a foreign official record&mdash;or an entry in it&mdash;that is otherwise admissible:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an official publication of the record; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the record&mdash;or a copy&mdash;that is attested by an authorized person and is accompanied either by a final certification of genuineness or by a certification under a treaty or convention to which the United States and the country where the record is located are parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Final Certification of Genuineness.</em> A final certification must certify the genuineness of the signature and official position of the attester or of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness relates to the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Other Means of Proof.</em> If all parties have had a reasonable opportunity to investigate a foreign record's authenticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause, either:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) admit an attested copy without final certification; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) permit the record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Lack of a Record.</cap-smallcap> A written statement that a diligent search of designated records revealed no record or entry of a specified tenor is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry. For domestic records, the statement must be authenticated under Rule 44(a)(1). For foreign records, the statement must comply with (a)(2)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Other Proof.</cap-smallcap> A party may prove an official record&mdash;or an entry or lack of an entry in it&mdash;by any other method authorized by law.</p>

<p class="note-body">For supplementary note of Advisory Committee on this rule, see note under rule 43.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)</em>. These provisions on proof of official records kept within the United States are similar in substance to those heretofore appearing in Rule 44. There is a more exact description of the geographical areas covered. An official record kept in one of the areas enumerated qualifies for proof under subdivision (a)(1) even though it is not a United States official record. For example, an official record kept in one of these areas by a government in exile falls within subdivision (a)(1). It also falls within subdivision (a)(2) which may be availed of alternatively. <em>Cf. Banco de Espana v. Federal Reserve Bank</em>, 114 F.2d 438 (2d Cir. 1940).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2)</em>. Foreign official records may be proved, as heretofore, by means of official publications thereof. See <em>United States v. Aluminum Co. of America</em>, 1 F.R.D. 71 (S.D.N.Y. 1939). Under this rule, a document that, on its face, appears to be an official publication, is admissible, unless a party opposing its admission into evidence shows that it lacks that character.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rest of subdivision (a)(2) aims to provide greater clarity, efficiency, and flexibility in the procedure for authenticating copies of foreign official records.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to attestation by &ldquo;the officer having the legal custody of the record,&rdquo; hitherto appearing in Rule 44, has been found inappropriate for official records kept in foreign countries where the assumed relation between custody and the authority to attest does not obtain. See 2B Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;992 (Wright ed. 1961). Accordingly it is provided that an attested copy may be obtained from any person authorized by the law of the foreign country to make the attestation without regard to whether he is charged with responsibility for maintaining the record or keeping it in his custody.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under Rule 44 a United States foreign service officer has been called on to certify to the authority of the foreign official attesting the copy as well as the genuineness of his signature and his official position. See Schlesinger, <em>Comparative Law</em> 57 (2d ed. 1959); Smit, <em>International Aspects of Federal Civil Procedure</em>, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1031, 1063 (1961); 22 C.F.R. &sect;92.41(a), (e) (1958). This has created practical difficulties. For example, the question of the authority of the foreign officer might raise issues of foreign law which were beyond the knowledge of the United States officer. The difficulties are met under the amended rule by eliminating the element of the authority of the attesting foreign official from the scope of the certifying process, and by specifically permitting use of the chain-certificate method. Under this method, it is sufficient if the original attestation purports to have been issued by an authorized person and is accompanied by a certificate of another foreign official whose certificate may in turn be followed by that of a foreign official of higher rank. The process continues until a foreign official is reached as to whom the United States foreign service official (or a diplomatic or consular officer of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States) has adequate information upon which to base a &ldquo;final certification.&rdquo; See <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Aronson</em>, 38 F.Supp. 687 (W.D.Pa. 1941); 22 C.F.R. &sect;92.37 (1958).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:231 --><p class="note-body">The final certification (a term used in contradistinction to the certificates prepared by the foreign officials in a chain) relates to the incumbency and genuineness of signature of the foreign official who attested the copy of the record or, where the chain-certificate method is used, of a foreign official whose certificate appears in the chain, whether that certificate is the last in the chain or not. A final certification may be prepared on the basis of material on file in the consulate or any other satisfactory information.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the amended rule will generally facilitate proof of foreign official records, it is recognized that in some situations it may be difficult or even impossible to satisfy the basic requirements of the rule. There may be no United States consul in a particular foreign country; the foreign officials may not cooperate, peculiarities may exist or arise hereafter in the law or practice of a foreign country. See <em>United States v. Grabina</em>, 119 F.2d 863 (2d Cir. 1941); and, generally, Jones, <em>International Judicial Assistance: Procedural Chaos and a Program for Reform</em>, 62 Yale L.J. 515, 548&ndash;49 (1953). Therefore the final sentence of subdivision (a)(2) provides the court with discretion to admit an attested copy of a record without a final certification, or an attested summary of a record with or without a final certification. See Rep. of Comm. on Comparative Civ. Proc. & Prac., Proc. A.B.A., Sec. Int'l & Comp. L. 123, 130&ndash;131 (1952); Model Code of Evidence &sect;&sect;517, 519 (1942). This relaxation should be permitted only when it is shown that the party has been unable to satisfy the basic requirements of the amended rule despite his reasonable efforts. Moreover, it is specially provided that the parties must be given a reasonable opportunity in these cases to examine into the authenticity and accuracy of the copy or summary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This provision relating to proof of lack of record is accommodated to the changes made in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment insures that international agreements of the United States are unaffected by the rule. Several consular conventions contain provisions for reception of copies or summaries of foreign official records. See, e.g., Consular Conv. with Italy, May 8, 1878, art. X, 20 Stat. 725, T.S. No. 178 (Dept. State 1878). See also 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1740&ndash;42, 1745; <em>Fakouri v. Cadais</em>, 149 F.2d 321 (5th Cir. 1945), cert. denied, 326 U.S. 742 (1945); 5 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, par. 44.05 (2d ed. 1951).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to paragraph (a)(1) strikes the references to specific territories, two of which are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and adds a generic term to describe governments having a relationship with the United States such that their official records should be treated as domestic records.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to paragraph (a)(2) adds a sentence to dispense with the final certification by diplomatic officers when the United States and the foreign country where the record is located are parties to a treaty or convention that abolishes or displaces the requirement. In that event the treaty or convention is to be followed. This changes the former procedure for authenticating foreign official records only with respect to records from countries that are parties to the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents. Moreover, it does not affect the former practice of attesting the records, but only changes the method of certifying the attestation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Hague Public Documents Convention provides that the requirement of a final certification is abolished and replaced with a model <em>apostille</em>, which is to be issued by officials of the country where the records are located. See Hague Public Documents Convention, Arts. 2&ndash;4. The <em>apostille</em> certifies the signature, official position, and seal of the attesting officer. The authority who issues the <em>apostille</em> must maintain a register or card index showing the serial number of the <em>apostille</em> and other relevant information recorded on it. A foreign court can then check the serial number and information on the <em>apostille</em> with the issuing authority in order to guard against the use of fraudulent <em>apostilles</em>. This system provides a reliable method for maintaining the integrity of the authentication process, and the <em>apostille</em> can be accorded greater weight than the normal authentication procedure because foreign officials are more likely to know the precise capacity under their law of the attesting officer than would an American official. See generally Comment, <em>The United States and the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents</em>, 11 HARV. INT'L L.J. 476, 482, 488 (1970).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign country's law must give notice by a pleading or other writing.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 44.1 is added by amendment to furnish Federal courts with a uniform and effective procedure for raising and determining an issue concerning the law of a foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">To avoid unfair surprise, the <em>first sentence</em> of the new rule requires that a party who intends to raise an issue of foreign law shall give notice thereof. The uncertainty under Rule 8(a) about whether foreign law must be pleaded&mdash;<em>compare Siegelman v. Cunard White Star, Ltd</em>., 221 F.2d 189 (2d Cir. 1955), and <em>Pedersen v. United States</em>, 191 F.Supp. 95 (D.Guam 1961), <em>with Harrison v. United Fruit Co</em>., 143 F.Supp. 598 (S.D.N.Y. 1956)&mdash;is eliminated by the provision that the notice shall be &ldquo;written&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo; It may, but need not be, incorporated in the pleadings. In some situations the pertinence of foreign law is apparent from the outset; accordingly the necessary investigation of that law will have been accomplished by the party at the pleading stage, and the notice can be given conveniently in the pleadings. In other situations the pertinence of foreign law may remain doubtful until the case is further developed. A requirement that notice of foreign law be given only through the medium of the pleadings would tend in the latter instances to force the party to engage in a peculiarly burdensome type of investigation which might turn out to be unnecessary; and correspondingly the adversary would be forced into a possible wasteful investigation. The liberal provisions for amendment of the pleadings afford help if the pleadings are used as the medium of giving notice of the foreign law; but it seems best to permit a written notice to be given outside of and later than the pleadings, provided the notice is reasonable.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:232 --><p class="note-body">The new rule does not attempt to set any definite limit on the party's time for giving the notice of an issue of foreign law; in some cases the issue may not become apparent until the trial and notice then given may still be reasonable. The stage which the case has reached at the time of the notice, the reason proffered by the party for his failure to give earlier notice, and the importance to the case as a whole of the issue of foreign law sought to be raised, are among the factors which the court should consider in deciding a question of the reasonableness of a notice. If notice is given by one party it need not be repeated by any other and serves as a basis for presentation of material on the foreign law by all parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">The <em>second sentence</em> of the new rule describes the materials to which the court may resort in determining an issue of foreign law. Heretofore the district courts, applying Rule 43(a), have looked in certain cases to State law to find the rules of evidence by which the content of foreign-country law is to be established. The State laws vary; some embody procedures which are inefficient, time consuming and expensive. See, generally, Nussbaum, <em>Proving the Law of Foreign Countries</em>, 3 Am.J.Comp.L. 60 (1954). In all events the ordinary rules of evidence are often inapposite to the problem of determining foreign law and have in the past prevented examination of material which could have provided a proper basis for the determination. The new rule permits consideration by the court of any relevant material, including testimony, without regard to its admissibility under Rule 43. Cf. N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law & Rules, R. 4511 (effective Sept. 1, 1963); 2 Va.Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect;8&ndash;273; 2 W.Va.Code Ann. &sect;5711.</p>
<p class="note-body">In further recognition of the peculiar nature of the issue of foreign law, the new rule provides that in determining this law the court is not limited by material presented by the parties; it may engage in its own research and consider any relevant material thus found. The court may have at its disposal better foreign law materials than counsel have presented, or may wish to reexamine and amplify material that has been presented by counsel in partisan fashion or in insufficient detail. On the other hand, the court is free to insist on a complete presentation by counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is no requirement that the court give formal notice to the parties of its intention to engage in its own research on an issue of foreign law which has been raised by them, or of its intention to raise and determine independently an issue not raised by them. Ordinarily the court should inform the parties of material it has found diverging substantially from the material which they have presented; and in general the court should give the parties an opportunity to analyze and counter new points upon which it proposes to rely. See Schlesinger, <em>Comparative Law</em> 142 (2d ed. 1959); Wyzanski, <em>A Trial Judge's Freedom and Responsibility</em>, 65 Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1296 (1952); cf. <em>Siegelman v. Cunard White Star, Ltd., supra</em>, 221 F.2d at 197. To require, however, that the court give formal notice from time to time as it proceeds with its study of the foreign law would add an element of undesirable rigidity to the procedure for determining issues of foreign law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new rule refrains from imposing an obligation on the court to take &ldquo;judicial notice&rdquo; of foreign law because this would put an extreme burden on the court in many cases; and it avoids use of the concept of &ldquo;judicial notice&rdquo; in any form because of the uncertain meaning of that concept as applied to foreign law. See, e.g., <em>Stern, Foreign Law in the Courts: Judicial Notice and Proof</em>, 45 Calif.L.Rev. 23, 43 (1957). Rather the rule provides flexible procedures for presenting and utilizing material on issues of foreign law by which a sound result can be achieved with fairness to the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the <em>third sentence</em>, the court's determination of an issue of foreign law is to be treated as a ruling on a question of &ldquo;law,&rdquo; not &ldquo;fact,&rdquo; so that appellate review will not be narrowly confined by the &ldquo;clearly erroneous&rdquo; standard of Rule 52(a). <em>Cf. Uniform Judicial Notice of Foreign Law Act</em> &sect;3; Note, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 318 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">The new rule parallels Article IV of the Uniform Interstate and International Procedure Act, approved by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1962, except that section 4.03 of Article IV states that &ldquo;[t]he court, not the jury&rdquo; shall determine foreign law. The new rule does not address itself to this problem, since the Rules refrain from allocating functions as between the court and the jury. See Rule 38(a). It has long been thought, however, that the jury is not the appropriate body to determine issues of foreign law. See, e.g., Story, <em>Conflict of Laws</em>, &sect;638 (1st ed. 1834, 8th ed. 1883); 1 Greenleaf, <em>Evidence</em>, &sect;486 (1st ed. 1842, 16th ed. 1899); 4 Wigmore, <em>Evidence</em> &sect;2558 (1st ed. 1905); 9 id. &sect;2558 (3d ed. 1940). The majority of the States have committed such issues to determination by the court. See Article 5 of the Uniform Judicial Notice of Foreign Law Act, adopted by twenty-six states, 9A U.L.A. 318 (1957) (Suppl. 1961, at 134); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law & Rules, R. 4511 (effective Sept. 1, 1963); Wigmore, <em>loc. cit</em>. And Federal courts that have considered the problem in recent years have reached the same conclusion without reliance on statute. See <em>Janson v. Swedish American Line</em>, 185 F.2d 212, 216 (1st Cir. 1950); <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. San Miguel</em>, 196 F.2d 950, 957, n. 6 (1st Cir. 1952); <em>Liechti v. Roche</em>, 198 F.2d 174 (5th Cir. 1952); <em>Daniel Lumber Co. v. Empresas Hondurenas, S.A</em>., 215 F.2d 465 (5th Cir. 1954).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Form and Contents.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Requirements&mdash;In General.</em> Every subpoena must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) state the court from which it issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) state the title of the action, the court in which it is pending, and its civil-action number;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) command each person to whom it is directed to do the following at a specified time and place: attend and testify; produce designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person's possession, custody, or control; or permit the inspection of premises; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:233 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) set out the text of Rule 45(c) and (d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Command to Attend a Deposition&mdash;Notice of the Recording Method.</em> A subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition must state the method for recording the testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Combining or Separating a Command to Produce or to Permit Inspection; Specifying the Form for Electronically Stored Information.</em> A command to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or to permit the inspection of premises may be included in a subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or may be set out in a separate subpoena. A subpoena may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Command to Produce; Included Obligations.</em> A command in a subpoena to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things requires the responding party to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Issued from Which Court.</em> A subpoena must issue as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for attendance at a hearing or trial, from the court for the district where the hearing or trial is to be held;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for attendance at a deposition, from the court for the district where the deposition is to be taken; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for production or inspection, if separate from a subpoena commanding a person's attendance, from the court for the district where the production or inspection is to be made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Issued by Whom.</em> The clerk must issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party who requests it. That party must complete it before service. An attorney also may issue and sign a subpoena as an officer of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a court in which the attorney is authorized to practice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a court for a district where a deposition is to be taken or production is to be made, if the attorney is authorized to practice in the court where the action is pending.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Service.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>By Whom; Tendering Fees; Serving a Copy of Certain Subpoenas.</em> Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a subpoena. Serving a subpoena requires delivering a copy to the named person and, if the subpoena requires that person's attendance, tendering the fees for 1 day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees and mileage need not be tendered when the subpoena issues on behalf of the United States or any of its officers or agencies. If the subpoena commands the production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or the inspection of premises before trial, then before it is served, a notice must be served on each party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Service in the United States.</em> Subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii), a subpoena may be served at any place:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) within the district of the issuing court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) outside that district but within 100 miles of the place specified for the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) within the state of the issuing court if a state statute or court rule allows service at that place of a subpoena issued by a state court of general jurisdiction sitting in the place specified for the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) that the court authorizes on motion and for good cause, if a federal statute so provides.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Service in a Foreign Country.</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783 governs issuing and serving a subpoena directed to a United States national or resident who is in a foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Proof of Service.</em> Proving service, when necessary, requires filing with the issuing court a statement showing the date and manner of service and the names of the persons served. The statement must be certified by the server.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions.</em> A party or attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena. The issuing court must enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction&mdash;which may include lost earnings and reasonable attorney's fees&mdash;on a party or attorney who fails to comply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Appearance Not Required.</em> A person commanded to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition, hearing, or trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Objections.</em> A person commanded to produce documents or tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing or sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises&mdash;or to producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party may move the issuing court for an order compelling production or inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer from significant expense resulting from compliance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>When Required.</em> On timely motion, the issuing court must quash or modify a subpoena that:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:234 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) requires a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to travel more than 100 miles from where that person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person&mdash;except that, subject to Rule 45(c)(3)(B)(iii), the person may be commanded to attend a trial by traveling from any such place within the state where the trial is held;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) subjects a person to undue burden.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>When Permitted.</em> To protect a person subject to or affected by a subpoena, the issuing court may, on motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) disclosing an unretained expert's opinion or information that does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert's study that was not requested by a party; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer to incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Specifying Conditions as an Alternative.</em> In the circumstances described in Rule 45(c)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified conditions if the serving party:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Duties in Responding to a Subpoena.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information.</em> These procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Documents.</em> A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified.</em> If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form.</em> The person responding need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information.</em> The person responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Claiming Privilege or Protection.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Information Withheld.</em> A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) expressly make the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Information Produced.</em> If information produced in response to a subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The person who produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Contempt.</cap-smallcap> The issuing court may hold in contempt a person who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena. A nonparty's failure to obey must be excused if the subpoena purports to require the nonparty to attend or produce at a place outside the limits of Rule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule applies to subpoenas <em>ad testificandum</em> and <em>duces tecum</em> issued by the district courts for attendance at a hearing or a trial, or to take depositions. It does not apply to the enforcement of subpoenas issued by administrative officers and commissions pursuant to statutory authority. The enforcement of such subpoenas by the district courts is regulated by appropriate statutes. Many of these statutes do not place any territorial limits on the validity of subpoenas so issued, but provide that they may be served anywhere within the United States. Among such statutes are the following:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 7, &sect;&sect;222 and 511n (Secretary of Agriculture)</p>

<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;U.S.C., Title 49, &sect;173a [see 46104] (Secretary of Commerce)</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em>. These simplify the form of subpoena as provided in U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;655 (Witnesses; subpoena; form; attendance under); and broaden U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;636 (Production of books and writings) to include all actions, and to extend to any person. With the provision for relief from an oppressive or unreasonable subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>, compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;411.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c)</em>. This provides for the simple and convenient method of service permitted under many state codes; e.g., N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;220, 404, J.Ct.Act, &sect;191; 3 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;1218. Compare Equity Rule 15 (Process, by Whom Served).</p>
<p class="note-body">For statutes governing fees and mileage of witnesses see:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 28:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;600a [now 1871] (Per diem; mileage)</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;600c [now 1821, 1825] (Amount per diem and mileage for witnesses; subsistence)</p>

<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;603 [see Title 5, &sect;&sect;5515, 5537] (No officer of court to have witness fees)</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. The method provided in paragraph (1) for the authorization of the issuance of subpoenas has been employed in some districts. See <em>Henning v. Boyle</em>, 112 Fed. 397 (S.D.N.Y., 1901). The requirement of an order for the issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> is in accordance with U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;647 (Deposition under <em>dedimus potestatem;</em> subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>). The provisions of paragraph (2) are in accordance with common practice. See U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;648 (Deposition under <em>dedimus potestatem;</em> witnesses, when required to attend); N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;300; 1 N.J.Rev.Stat. (1937) 2:27&ndash;174.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (e)</em>. The first paragraph continues the substance of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;654 (Witnesses; subpoenas; may run into another district). Compare U.S.C., Title 11, [former] &sect;69 (Referees in bankruptcy; contempts before) (production of books and writings) which is not affected by this rule. For examples of statutes which allow the court, upon proper application and cause shown, to authorize the clerk of the court to issue a subpoena for a witness who lives in another district and at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of the hearing or trial, see:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">U.S.C., Title 15:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&sect;23 (Suits by United States; subpoenas for witnesses) (under antitrust laws).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph continues the present procedure applicable to certain witnesses who are in foreign countries. See U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;&sect;711 [now 1783] (Letters rogatory to take testimony of witness, addressed to court of foreign country; failure of witness to appear; subpoena) and 713 [now 1783] (Service of subpoena on witness in foreign country).</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The added words, &ldquo;or tangible things&rdquo; in subdivision (b) merely make the rule for the subpoena duces tecum at the trial conform to that of subdivision (d) for the subpoena at the taking of depositions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The insertion of the words &ldquo;or modify&rdquo; in clause (1) affords desirable flexibility.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The added last sentence of amended subdivision (d)(1) properly gives the subpoena for documents or tangible things the same scope as provided in Rule 26(b), thus promoting uniformity. The requirement in the last sentence of original Rule 45(d)(1)&mdash;to the effect that leave of court should be obtained for the issuance of such a subpoena&mdash;has been omitted. This requirement is unnecessary and oppressive on both counsel and court, and it has been criticized by district judges. There is no satisfactory reason for a differentiation between a subpoena for the production of documentary evidence by a witness at a trial (Rule 45(a)) and for the production of the same evidence at the taking of a deposition. Under this amendment, the person subpoenaed may obtain the protection afforded by any of the orders permitted under Rule 30(b) or Rule 45(b). See <em>Application of Zenith Radio Corp</em>. (E.D.Pa. 1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 30b.21, Case 1, 1 F.R.D. 627; <em>Fox v. House</em> (E.D.Okla. 1939) 29 F.Supp. 673; <em>United States of America for the Use of Tilo Roofing Co., Inc. v. J. Slotnik Co</em>. (D.Conn. 1944) 3 F.R.D. 408.</p>
<p class="note-body">The changes in subdivision (d)(2) give the court the same power in the case of residents of the district as is conferred in the case of non-residents, and permit the court to fix a place for attendance which may be more convenient and accessible for the parties than that specified in the rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">At present, when a subpoena duces tecum is issued to a deponent, he is required to produce the listed materials at the deposition, but is under no clear compulsion to permit their inspection and copying. This results in confusion and uncertainty before the time the deposition is taken, with no mechanism provided whereby the court can resolve the matter. Rule 45(d)(1), as revised, makes clear that the subpoena authorizes inspection and copying of the materials produced. The deponent is afforded full protection since he can object, thereby forcing the party serving the subpoena to obtain a court order if he wishes to inspect and copy. The procedure is thus analogous to that provided in Rule 34.</p>
<p class="note-body">The changed references to other rules conform to changes made in those rules. The deletion of words in the clause describing the proper scope of the subpoena conforms to a change made in the language of Rule 34. The reference to Rule 26(b) is unchanged but encompasses new matter in that subdivision. The changes <!-- PDFPage:236 -->make it clear that the scope of discovery through a subpoena is the same as that applicable to Rule 34 and the other discovery rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1980 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(1)</em>. The amendment defines the term &ldquo;proof of service&rdquo; as used in the first sentence of the present subdivision. For want of a definition, the district court clerks have been obliged to fashion their own, with results that vary from district to district. All that seems required is a simple certification on a copy of the notice to take a deposition that the notice has been served on every other party to the action. That is the proof of service required by Rule 25(d) of both the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Supreme Court Rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)(1)</em>. The amendment makes the reach of a subpoena of a district court at least as extensive as that of the state courts of general jurisdiction in the state in which the district court is held. Under the present rule the reach of a district court subpoena is often greater, since it extends throughout the district. No reason appears why it should be less, as it sometimes is because of the accident of district lines. Restrictions upon the reach of subpoenas are imposed to prevent undue inconvenience to witnesses. State statutes and rules of court are quite likely to reflect the varying degrees of difficulty and expense attendant upon local travel.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Present Rule 45(d)(2) has two sentences setting forth the territorial scope of deposition subpoenas. The first sentence is directed to depositions taken in the judicial district in which the deponent resides; the second sentence addresses situations in which the deponent is not a resident of the district in which the deposition is to take place. The Rule, as currently constituted, creates anomalous situations that often cause logistical problems in conducting litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of the present Rule states that a deponent may be required to attend only in the <em>county</em> wherein that person resides or is employed or transacts business in person, that is, where the person lives or works. Under this provision a deponent can be compelled, without court order, to travel from one end of that person's home county to the other, no matter how far that may be. The second sentence of the Rule is somewhat more flexible, stating that someone who does not reside in the district in which the deposition is to be taken can be required to attend in the county where the person is served with the subpoena, <em>or</em> within 40 miles from the place of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under today's conditions there is no sound reason for distinguishing between residents of the district or county in which a deposition is to be taken and nonresidents, and the Rule is amended to provide that any person may be subpoenaed to attend a deposition within a specified radius from that person's residence, place of business, or where the person was served. The 40-mile radius has been increased to 100 miles.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Purposes of Revision. The purposes of this revision are (1) to clarify and enlarge the protections afforded persons who are required to assist the court by giving information or evidence; (2) to facilitate access outside the deposition procedure provided by Rule 30 to documents and other information in the possession of persons who are not parties; (3) to facilitate service of subpoenas for depositions or productions of evidence at places distant from the district in which an action is proceeding; (4) to enable the court to compel a witness found within the state in which the court sits to attend trial; (5) to clarify the organization of the text of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision is amended in seven significant respects.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, Paragraph (a)(3) modifies the requirement that a subpoena be issued by the clerk of court. Provision is made for the issuance of subpoenas by attorneys as officers of the court. This revision perhaps culminates an evolution. Subpoenas were long issued by specific order of the court. As this became a burden to the court, general orders were made authorizing clerks to issue subpoenas on request. Since 1948, they have been issued in blank by the clerk of any federal court to any lawyer, the clerk serving as stationer to the bar. In allowing counsel to issue the subpoena, the rule is merely a recognition of present reality.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the subpoena is in a sense the command of the attorney who completes the form, defiance of a subpoena is nevertheless an act in defiance of a court order and exposes the defiant witness to contempt sanctions. In <em>ICC v. Brimson</em>, 154 U.S. 447 (1894), the Court upheld a statute directing federal courts to issue subpoenas to compel testimony before the ICC. In <em>CAB v. Hermann</em>, 353 U.S. 322 (1957), the Court approved as established practice the issuance of administrative subpoenas as a matter of absolute agency right. And in <em>NLRB v. Warren Co</em>., 350 U.S. 107 (1955), the Court held that the lower court had no discretion to withhold sanctions against a contemnor who violated such subpoenas. The 1948 revision of Rule 45 put the attorney in a position similar to that of the administrative agency, as a public officer entitled to use the court's contempt power to investigate facts in dispute. Two courts of appeals have touched on the issue and have described lawyer-issued subpoenas as mandates of the court. <em>Waste Conversion, Inc. v. Rollins Environmental Services (NJ), Inc</em>., 893 F.2d 605 (3d cir., 1990); <em>Fisher v. Marubent Cotton Corp</em>., 526 F.2d 1338, 1340 (8th cir., 1975). Cf. <em>Young v. United States ex rel Vuitton et Fils S.A</em>., 481 U.S. 787, 821 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring). This revision makes the rule explicit that the attorney acts as an officer of the court in issuing and signing subpoenas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Necessarily accompanying the evolution of this power of the lawyer as officer of the court is the development of increased responsibility and liability for the misuse of this power. The latter development is reflected in the provisions of subdivision (c) of this rule, and also in the requirement imposed by paragraph (3) of this subdivision that the attorney issuing a subpoena must sign it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, Paragraph (a)(3) authorizes attorneys in distant districts to serve as officers authorized to issue commands in the name of the court. Any attorney permitted to represent a client in a federal court, even one admitted pro hac vice, has the same authority as a clerk to issue a subpoena from any federal court for the district in which the subpoena is served and enforced. In authorizing attorneys to issue subpoenas from distant courts, the amended rule effectively authorizes service of a subpoena anywhere in the United States by an attorney representing any party. This change is intended to ease the administrative burdens of inter-district law practice. The former rule resulted in delay and expense caused by the need to secure forms from clerks&rsquo; offices some distance from the place at which the action proceeds. This change does not enlarge the burden on the witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to Paragraph (a)(2), a subpoena for a deposition must still issue from the court in which the deposition or production would be compelled. Accordingly, a motion to quash such a subpoena if it overbears the limits of the subpoena power must, as under the previous rule, be presented to the court for the district in which the deposition would occur. Likewise, the court in whose name the subpoena is issued is responsible for its enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, in order to relieve attorneys of the need to secure an appropriate seal to affix to a subpoena issued <!-- PDFPage:237 -->as an officer of a distant court, the requirement that a subpoena be under seal is abolished by the provisions of Paragraph (a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, Paragraph (a)(1) authorizes the issuance of a subpoena to compel a non-party to produce evidence independent of any deposition. This revision spares the necessity of a deposition of the custodian of evidentiary material required to be produced. A party seeking additional production from a person subject to such a subpoena may serve an additional subpoena requiring additional production at the same time and place.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fifth, Paragraph (a)(2) makes clear that the person subject to the subpoena is required to produce materials in that person's control whether or not the materials are located within the district or within the territory within which the subpoena can be served. The non-party witness is subject to the same scope of discovery under this rule as that person would be as a party to whom a request is addressed pursuant to Rule 34.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sixth, Paragraph (a)(1) requires that the subpoena include a statement of the rights and duties of witnesses by setting forth in full the text of the new subdivisions (c) and (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Seventh, the revised rule authorizes the issuance of a subpoena to compel the inspection of premises in the possession of a non-party. Rule 34 has authorized such inspections of premises in the possession of a party as discovery compelled under Rule 37, but prior practice required an independent proceeding to secure such relief ancillary to the federal proceeding when the premises were not in the possession of a party. Practice in some states has long authorized such use of a subpoena for this purpose without apparent adverse consequence.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Paragraph (b)(1) retains the text of the former subdivision (c) with minor changes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to the United States marshal and deputy marshal is deleted because of the infrequency of the use of these officers for this purpose. Inasmuch as these officers meet the age requirement, they may still be used if available.</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision requiring service of prior notice pursuant to Rule 5 of compulsory pretrial production or inspection has been added to paragraph (b)(1). The purpose of such notice is to afford other parties an opportunity to object to the production or inspection, or to serve a demand for additional documents or things. Such additional notice is not needed with respect to a deposition because of the requirement of notice imposed by Rule 30 or 31. But when production or inspection is sought independently of a deposition, other parties may need notice in order to monitor the discovery and in order to pursue access to any information that may or should be produced.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (b)(2) retains language formerly set forth in subdivision (e) and extends its application to subpoenas for depositions or production.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (b)(3) retains language formerly set forth in paragraph (d)(1) and extends its applications to subpoenas for trial or hearing or production.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This provision is new and states the rights of witnesses. It is not intended to diminish rights conferred by Rules 26&ndash;37 or any other authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (c)(1) gives specific application to the principle stated in Rule 26(g) and specifies liability for earnings lost by a non-party witness as a result of a misuse of the subpoena. No change in existing law is thereby effected. Abuse of a subpoena is an actionable tort, <em>Board of Ed. v. Farmingdale Classroom Teach. Ass'n</em>, 38 N.Y.2d 397, 380 N.Y.S.2d 635, 343 N.E.2d 278 (1975), and the duty of the attorney to the non-party is also embodied in Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.4. The liability of the attorney is correlative to the expanded power of the attorney to issue subpoenas. The liability may include the cost of fees to collect attorneys&rsquo; fees owed as a result of a breach of this duty.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (c)(2) retains language from the former subdivision (b) and paragraph (d)(1). The 10-day period for response to a subpoena is extended to 14 days to avoid the complex calculations associated with short time periods under Rule 6 and to allow a bit more time for such objections to be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">A non-party required to produce documents or materials is protected against significant expense resulting from involuntary assistance to the court. This provision applies, for example, to a non-party required to provide a list of class members. The court is not required to fix the costs in advance of production, although this will often be the most satisfactory accommodation to protect the party seeking discovery from excessive costs. In some instances, it may be preferable to leave uncertain costs to be determined after the materials have been produced, provided that the risk of uncertainty is fully disclosed to the discovering party. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems, Inc</em>., 666 F.2d 364 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (c)(3) explicitly authorizes the quashing of a subpoena as a means of protecting a witness from misuse of the subpoena power. It replaces and enlarges on the former subdivision (b) of this rule and tracks the provisions of Rule 26(c). While largely repetitious, this rule is addressed to the witness who may read it on the subpoena, where it is required to be printed by the revised paragraph (a)(1) of this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(3)(A) identifies those circumstances in which a subpoena must be quashed or modified. It restates the former provisions with respect to the limits of mandatory travel that are set forth in the former paragraphs (d)(2) and (e)(1), with one important change. Under the revised rule, a federal court can compel a witness to come from any place in the state to attend trial, whether or not the local state law so provides. This extension is subject to the qualification provided in the next paragraph, which authorizes the court to condition enforcement of a subpoena compelling a non-party witness to bear substantial expense to attend trial. The traveling non-party witness may be entitled to reasonable compensation for the time and effort entailed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(A)(iv) requires the court to protect all persons from undue burden imposed by the use of the subpoena power. Illustratively, it might be unduly burdensome to compel an adversary to attend trial as a witness if the adversary is known to have no personal knowledge of matters in dispute, especially so if the adversary would be required to incur substantial travel burdens.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(3)(B) identifies circumstances in which a subpoena should be quashed unless the party serving the subpoena shows a substantial need and the court can devise an appropriate accommodation to protect the interests of the witness. An additional circumstance in which such action is required is a request for costly production of documents; that situation is expressly governed by subparagraph (b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(B)(i) authorizes the court to quash, modify, or condition a subpoena to protect the person subject to or affected by the subpoena from unnecessary or unduly harmful disclosures of confidential information. It corresponds to Rule 26(c)(7).</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(B)(ii) provides appropriate protection for the intellectual property of the non-party witness; it does not apply to the expert retained by a party, whose information is subject to the provisions of Rule 26(b)(4). A growing problem has been the use of subpoenas to compel the giving of evidence and information by unretained experts. Experts are not exempt from the duty to give evidence, even if they cannot be compelled to prepare themselves to give effective testimony, <em>e.g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Otte</em>, 474 F.2d 529 (2d Cir. 1972), but compulsion to give evidence may threaten the intellectual property of experts denied the opportunity to bargain for the value of their services. See generally Maurer, <em>Compelling the Expert Witness: Fairness and Utility Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, 19 GA.L.REV. 71 (1984); Note, <em>Discovery and Testimony of Unretained Experts</em>, 1987 DUKE L.J. 140. Arguably the compulsion to testify can be regarded as a &ldquo;taking&rdquo; of intellectual property. The rule establishes the right of such persons to withhold their expertise, at least unless <!-- PDFPage:238 -->the party seeking it makes the kind of showing required for a conditional denial of a motion to quash as provided in the final sentence of subparagraph (c)(3)(B); that requirement is the same as that necessary to secure work product under Rule 26(b)(3) and gives assurance of reasonable compensation. The Rule thus approves the accommodation of competing interests exemplified in <em>United States v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems Inc</em>., 666 F.2d 364 (9th Cir. 1982). See also <em>Wright v. Jeep Corporation</em>, 547 F. Supp. 871 (E.D. Mich. 1982).</p>
<p class="note-body">As stated in <em>Kaufman v. Edelstein</em>, 539 F.2d 811, 822 (2d Cir. 1976), the district court's discretion in these matters should be informed by &ldquo;the degree to which the expert is being called because of his knowledge of facts relevant to the case rather than in order to give opinion testimony; the difference between testifying to a previously formed or expressed opinion and forming a new one; the possibility that, for other reasons, the witness is a unique expert; the extent to which the calling party is able to show the unlikelihood that any comparable witness will willingly testify; and the degree to which the witness is able to show that he has been oppressed by having continually to testify.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (c)(3)(B)(iii) protects non-party witnesses who may be burdened to perform the duty to travel in order to provide testimony at trial. The provision requires the court to condition a subpoena requiring travel of more than 100 miles on reasonable compensation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This provision is new. Paragraph (d)(1) extends to non-parties the duty imposed on parties by the last paragraph of Rule 34(b), which was added in 1980.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (d)(2) is new and corresponds to the new Rule 26(b)(5). Its purpose is to provide a party whose discovery is constrained by a claim of privilege or work product protection with information sufficient to evaluate such a claim and to resist if it seems unjustified. The person claiming a privilege or protection cannot decide the limits of that party's own entitlement.</p>
<p class="note-body">A party receiving a discovery request who asserts a privilege or protection but fails to disclose that claim is at risk of waiving the privilege or protection. A person claiming a privilege or protection who fails to provide adequate information about the privilege or protection claim to the party seeking the information is subject to an order to show cause why the person should not be held in contempt under subdivision (e). Motions for such orders and responses to motions are subject to the sanctions provisions of Rules 7 and 11.</p>
<p class="note-body">A person served a subpoena that is too broad may be faced with a burdensome task to provide full information regarding all that person's claims to privilege or work product protection. Such a person is entitled to protection that may be secured through an objection made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. This provision retains most of the language of the former subdivision (f).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Adequate cause&rdquo; for a failure to obey a subpoena remains undefined. In at least some circumstances, a non-party might be guilty of contempt for refusing to obey a subpoena even though the subpoena manifestly overreaches the appropriate limits of the subpoena power. <em>E.g., Walker v. City of Birmingham</em>, 388 U.S. 307 (1967). But, because the command of the subpoena is not in fact one uttered by a judicial officer, contempt should be very sparingly applied when the non-party witness has been overborne by a party or attorney. The language added to subdivision (f) is intended to assure that result where a non-party has been commanded, on the signature of an attorney, to travel greater distances than can be compelled pursuant to this rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment closes a small gap in regard to notifying witnesses of the manner for recording a deposition. A deposition subpoena must state the method for recording the testimony.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 30(b)(2) directs that the party noticing a deposition state in the notice the manner for recording the testimony, but the notice need not be served on the deponent. The deponent learns of the recording method only if the deponent is a party or is informed by a party. Rule 30(b)(3) permits another party to designate an additional method of recording with prior notice to the deponent and the other parties. The deponent thus has notice of the recording method when an additional method is designated. This amendment completes the notice provisions to ensure that a nonparty deponent has notice of the recording method when the recording method is described only in the deposition notice.</p>
<p class="note-body">A subpoenaed witness does not have a right to refuse to proceed with a deposition due to objections to the manner of recording. But under rare circumstances, a nonparty witness might have a ground for seeking a protective order under Rule 26(c) with regard to the manner of recording or the use of the deposition if recorded in a certain manner. Should such a witness not learn of the manner of recording until the deposition begins, undesirable delay or complication might result. Advance notice of the recording method affords an opportunity to raise such protective issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes are made to conform Rule 45(a)(2) to current style conventions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. Only a small style change has been made in the proposal as published.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2006 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 45 is amended to conform the provisions for subpoenas to changes in other discovery rules, largely related to discovery of electronically stored information. Rule 34 is amended to provide in greater detail for the production of electronically stored information. Rule 45(a)(1)(C) is amended to recognize that electronically stored information, as defined in Rule 34(a), can also be sought by subpoena. Like Rule 34(b), Rule 45(a)(1) is amended to provide that the subpoena can designate a form or forms for production of electronic data. Rule 45(c)(2) is amended, like Rule 34(b), to authorize the person served with a subpoena to object to the requested form or forms. In addition, as under Rule 34(b), Rule 45(d)(1)(B) is amended to provide that if the subpoena does not specify the form or forms for electronically stored information, the person served with the subpoena must produce electronically stored information in a form or forms in which it is usually maintained or in a form or forms that are reasonably usable. Rule 45(d)(1)(C) is added to provide that the person producing electronically stored information should not have to produce the same information in more than one form unless so ordered by the court for good cause.</p>
<p class="note-body">As with discovery of electronically stored information from parties, complying with a subpoena for such information may impose burdens on the responding person. Rule 45(c) provides protection against undue impositions on nonparties. For example, Rule 45(c)(1) directs that a party serving a subpoena &ldquo;shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena,&rdquo; and Rule 45(c)(2)(B) permits the person served with the subpoena to object to it and directs that an order requiring compliance &ldquo;shall protect a person who is neither a party nor a party's officer from significant expense resulting from&rdquo; compliance. Rule 45(d)(1)(D) is added to provide that the responding person need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources the party identifies as not reasonably accessible, unless the court orders such discovery for good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(C), on terms that protect a nonparty against significant expense. A parallel provision is added to Rule 26(b)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 45(a)(1)(B) is also amended, as is Rule 34(a), to provide that a subpoena is available to permit testing and sampling as well as inspection and copying. As in Rule 34, this change recognizes that on occasion the opportunity to perform testing or sampling may be important, both for documents and for electronically stored information. Because testing or sampling may present particular issues of burden or intrusion for the person served with the subpoena, however, the protec<!-- PDFPage:239 -->tive provisions of Rule 45(c) should be enforced with vigilance when such demands are made. Inspection or testing of certain types of electronically stored information or of a person's electronic information system may raise issues of confidentiality or privacy. The addition of sampling and testing to Rule 45(a) with regard to documents and electronically stored information is not meant to create a routine right of direct access to a person's electronic information system, although such access might be justified in some circumstances. Courts should guard against undue intrusiveness resulting from inspecting or testing such systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 45(d)(2) is amended, as is Rule 26(b)(5), to add a procedure for assertion of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation materials after production. The receiving party may submit the information to the court for resolution of the privilege claim, as under Rule 26(b)(5)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other minor amendments are made to conform the rule to the changes described above.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. The Committee recommends a modified version of the proposal as published. The changes were made to maintain the parallels between Rule 45 and the other rules that address discovery of electronically stored information. These changes are fully described in the introduction to Rule 45 and in the discussions of the other rules. [Omitted]</p>
<p class="note-body">The changes from the published proposed amendment are shown below. [Omitted]</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 45 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to discovery of &ldquo;books&rdquo; in former Rule 45(a)(1)(C) was deleted to achieve consistent expression throughout the discovery rules. Books remain a proper subject of discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 45(b)(1) required &ldquo;prior notice&rdquo; to each party of any commanded production of documents and things or inspection of premises. Courts have agreed that notice must be given &ldquo;prior&rdquo; to the return date, and have tended to converge on an interpretation that requires notice to the parties before the subpoena is served on the person commanded to produce or permit inspection. That interpretation is adopted in amended Rule 45(b)(1) to give clear notice of general present practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language of former Rule 45(d)(2) addressing the manner of asserting privilege is replaced by adopting the wording of Rule 26(b)(5). The same meaning is better expressed in the same words.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The revision of this subdivision brings it into line with the amendment of Rule 24(c) of the Federal Rules <!-- PDFPage:240 -->of Criminal Procedure. That rule previously allowed four alternate jurors, as contrasted with the two allowed in civil cases, and the amendments increase the number of a maximum of six in all cases. The Advisory Committee's Note to amended Criminal Rule 24(c) points to experience demonstrating that four alternates may not be enough in some lengthy criminal trials; and the same may be said of civil trials. The Note adds:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The words &lsquo;or are found to be&rsquo; are added to the second sentence to make clear that an alternate juror may be called in the situation where it is first discovered during the trial that a juror was unable or disqualified to perform his duties at the time he was sworn.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The former provision for alternate jurors is stricken and the institution of the alternate juror abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former rule reflected the long-standing assumption that a jury would consist of exactly twelve members. It provided for additional jurors to be used as substitutes for jurors who are for any reason excused or disqualified from service after the commencement of the trial. Additional jurors were traditionally designated at the outset of the trial, and excused at the close of the evidence if they had not been promoted to full service on account of the elimination of one of the original jurors.</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of alternate jurors has been a source of dissatisfaction with the jury system because of the burden it places on alternates who are required to listen to the evidence but denied the satisfaction of participating in its evaluation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This provision makes it clear that the court may in appropriate circumstances excuse a juror during the jury deliberations without causing a mistrial. Sickness, family emergency or juror misconduct that might occasion a mistrial are examples of appropriate grounds for excusing a juror. It is not grounds for the dismissal of a juror that the juror refuses to join with fellow jurors in reaching a unanimous verdict.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 47 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>

<p class="note-body">For provisions in state codes, compare Utah Rev.Stat.Ann.

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The former rule was rendered obsolete by the adoption in many districts of local rules establishing six as the standard size for a civil jury.</p>
<p class="note-body">It appears that the minimum size of a jury consistent with the Seventh Amendment is six. <em>Cf. Ballew v. Georgia</em>, 435 U.S. 223 (1978) (holding that a conviction based on a jury of less than six is a denial of due process of law). If the parties agree to trial before a smaller jury, a verdict can be taken, but the parties should not other than in exceptional circumstances be encouraged to waive the right to a jury of six, not only because of the constitutional stature of the right, but also because smaller juries are more erratic and less effective in serving to distribute responsibility for the exercise of judicial power.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the institution of the alternate juror has been abolished by the proposed revision of Rule 47, it will ordinarily be prudent and necessary, in order to provide for sickness or disability among jurors, to seat more than six jurors. The use of jurors in excess of six increases the representativeness of the jury and harms no interest of a party. <em>Ray v. Parkside Surgery Center</em>, 13 F.R. Serv. 585 (6th cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court takes the precaution of seating a jury larger than six, an illness occurring during the deliberation period will not result in a mistrial, as it did formerly, because all seated jurors will participate in the verdict and a sufficient number will remain to render a unanimous verdict of six or more.</p>
<p class="note-body">In exceptional circumstances, as where a jury suffers depletions during trial and deliberation that are greater than can reasonably be expected, the parties may agree to be bound by a verdict rendered by fewer than six jurors. The court should not, however, rely upon the availability of such an agreement, for the use of juries smaller than six is problematic for reasons fully explained in <em>Ballew v. Georgia</em>, supra.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding on each issue of fact. The court may do so by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) submitting written questions susceptible of a categorical or other brief answer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) submitting written forms of the special findings that might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) using any other method that the court considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Instructions.</em> The court must give the instructions and explanations necessary to enable the jury to make its findings on each submitted issue.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:241 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Issues Not Submitted.</em> A party waives the right to a jury trial on any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or evidence but not submitted to the jury unless, before the jury retires, the party demands its submission to the jury. If the party does not demand submission, the court may make a finding on the issue. If the court makes no finding, it is considered to have made a finding consistent with its judgment on the special verdict.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Verdict with Answers to Written Questions.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> The court may submit to the jury forms for a general verdict, together with written questions on one or more issues of fact that the jury must decide. The court must give the instructions and explanations necessary to enable the jury to render a general verdict and answer the questions in writing, and must direct the jury to do both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Verdict and Answers Consistent.</em> When the general verdict and the answers are consistent, the court must approve, for entry under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment on the verdict and answers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Answers Inconsistent with the Verdict.</em> When the answers are consistent with each other but one or more is inconsistent with the general verdict, the court may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) approve, for entry under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment according to the answers, notwithstanding the general verdict;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) direct the jury to further consider its answers and verdict; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) order a new trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Answers Inconsistent with Each Other and the Verdict.</em> When the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is also inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment must not be entered; instead, the court must direct the jury to further consider its answers and verdict, or must order a new trial.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Judgment as a Matter of Law.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) resolve the issue against the party; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Motion.</em> A motion for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before the case is submitted to the jury. The motion must specify the judgment sought and the law and facts that entitle the movant to the judgment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Renewing the Motion After Trial; Alternative Motion for a New Trial.</cap-smallcap> If the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made under Rule 50(a), the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment&mdash;or if the motion addresses a jury issue not decided by a verdict, no later than 28 days after the jury was discharged&mdash;the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on the renewed motion, the court may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) allow judgment on the verdict, if the jury returned a verdict;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) order a new trial; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Granting the Renewed Motion; Conditional Ruling on a Motion for a New Trial.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> If the court grants a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, it must also conditionally rule on any motion for a new trial by determining whether a new trial should be granted if the judgment is later vacated or reversed. The court must state the grounds for conditionally granting or denying the motion for a new trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Effect of a Conditional Ruling.</em> Conditionally granting the motion for a new trial does not affect the judgment's finality; if the judgment is reversed, the new trial must proceed unless the appellate court orders otherwise. If the motion for a new trial is conditionally denied, the appellee may assert error <!-- PDFPage:242 -->in that denial; if the judgment is reversed, the case must proceed as the appellate court orders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Time for a Losing Party's New-Trial Motion.</cap-smallcap> Any motion for a new trial under Rule 59 by a party against whom judgment as a matter of law is rendered must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Denying the Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law; Reversal on Appeal.</cap-smallcap> If the court denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the prevailing party may, as appellee, assert grounds entitling it to a new trial should the appellate court conclude that the trial court erred in denying the motion. If the appellate court reverses the judgment, it may order a new trial, direct the trial court to determine whether a new trial should be granted, or direct the entry of judgment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. The present federal rule is changed to the extent that the formality of an express reservation of rights against waiver is no longer necessary. See <em>Sampliner v. Motion Picture Patents Co</em>., 254 U.S. 233 (1920); <em>Union Indemnity Co. v. United States</em>, 74 F.(2d) 645 (C.C.A.6th, 1935). The requirement that specific grounds for the motion for a directed verdict must be stated settles a conflict in the federal cases. See Simkins, <em>Federal Practice</em> (1934) &sect;189.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. For comparable state practice upheld under the conformity act, see <em>Baltimore and Carolina Line v. Redman</em>, 295 U.S. 654 (1935); compare <em>Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co</em>., 228 U.S. 364 (1913).</p>
<p class="note-body">See <em>Northern Ry. Co. v. Page</em>, 274 U.S. 65 (1927), following the Massachusetts practice of alternative verdicts, explained in Thorndike, <em>Trial by Jury in United States Courts</em>, 26 Harv.L.Rev. 732 (1913).

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The practice, after the court has granted a motion for a directed verdict, of requiring the jury to express assent to a verdict they did not reach by their own deliberations serves no useful purpose and may give offense to the members of the jury. See 2B Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;1072, at 367 (Wright ed. 1961); Blume, <em>Origin and Development of the Directed Verdict</em>, 48 Mich.L.Rev. 555, 582&ndash;85, 589&ndash;90 (1950). The final sentence of the subdivision, added by amendment, provides that the court's order granting a motion for a directed verdict is effective in itself, and that no action need be taken by the foreman or other members of the jury. See Ariz.R.Civ.P. 50(c); cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 (a). No change is intended in the standard to be applied in deciding the motion. To assure this interpretation, and in the interest of simplicity, the traditional term, &ldquo;directed verdict,&rdquo; is retained.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict will not lie unless it was preceded by a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of the second sentence of this subdivision sets the time limit for making the motion for judgment n.o.v. at 10 days after the entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after the reception of the verdict. Thus the time provision is made consistent with that contained in Rule 59(b) (time for motion for new trial) and Rule 52(b) (time for motion to amend findings by the court).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> deals with the situation where a party joins a motion for a new trial with his motion for judgment n.o.v. or prays for a new trial in the alternative, and the motion for judgment n.o.v. is granted. The procedure to be followed in making rulings on the motion for the new trial, and the consequences of the rulings thereon, were partly set out in <em>Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan</em>, 311 U.S. 243, 253, 61 S.Ct. 189, 85 L.Ed. 147 (1940), and have been further elaborated in later cases. See <em>Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co</em>., 330 U.S. 212, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947); <em>Globe Liquor Co., Inc. v. San Roman</em>, 332 U.S. 571, 68 S.Ct. 246, 92 L.Ed. 177 (1948); <em>Fountain v. Filson</em>, 336 U.S. 681, 69 S.Ct. 754, 93 L.Ed. 971 (1949); <em>Johnson v. New York, N.H. & H.R.R. Co</em>., 344 U.S. 48, 73 S.Ct. 125, 97 L.Ed. 77 (1952). However, courts as well as counsel have often misunderstood the procedure, and it will be helpful to summarize the proper practice in the text of the rule. The amendments do not alter the effects of a jury verdict or the scope of appellate review.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the situation mentioned, <em>subdivision (c)(1)</em> requires that the court make a &ldquo;conditional&rdquo; ruling on the new-trial motion, i.e., a ruling which goes on the assumption that the motion for judgment n.o.v. was erroneously granted and will be reversed or vacated; and the court is required to state its grounds for the conditional ruling. Subdivision (c)(1) then spells out the consequences of a reversal of the judgment in the light of the conditional ruling on the new-trial motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the motion for new trial has been conditionally granted, and the judgment is reversed, &ldquo;the new trial shall proceed unless the appellate court has otherwise ordered.&rdquo; The party against whom the judgment n.o.v. was entered below may, as appellant, besides seeking to overthrow that judgment, also attack the conditional grant of the new trial. And the appellate court, if it reverses the judgment n.o.v., may in an appropriate case also reverse the conditional grant of the new trial and direct that judgment be entered on the verdict.

Lou Johnson Co</em>., 249 F.2d 246 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 968, 78 S.Ct. 1008, 2 L.Ed.2d 1074 (1958); <em>Peters v. Smith</em>, 221 F.2d 721 (3d Cir.1955); <em>Dailey v.

<p class="note-body">If the motion for a new trial has been conditionally denied, and the judgment is reversed, &ldquo;subsequent proceedings shall be in accordance with the order of the appellate court.&rdquo; The party in whose favor judgment n.o.v. was entered below may, as appellee, besides seeking to uphold that judgment, also urge on the appellate court that the trial court committed error in conditionally denying the new trial. The appellee may assert this error in his brief, without taking a cross-appeal. <em>Cf. Patterson v. Pennsylvania R.R</em>., 238 F.2d 645, 650 (6th Cir. 1956); <em>Hughes v. St. Louis Nat. L. Baseball Club, Inc</em>., 359 Mo. 993, 997, 224 S.W.2d 989, 992 (1949). If the appellate court concludes that the judgment cannot stand, but accepts the appellee's contention that there was error in the conditional denial of the new trial, it may order a new trial in lieu of directing the entry of judgment upon the verdict.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(2)</em>, which also deals with the situation where the trial court has granted the motion for judgment n.o.v., states that the verdict-winner may apply to the trial court for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 after the judgment n.o.v. has been entered against him. In arguing to the trial court in opposition to the motion for judgment n.o.v., the verdict-winner may, and <!-- PDFPage:243 -->often will, contend that he is entitled, at the least, to a new trial, and the court has a range of discretion to grant a new trial or (where plaintiff won the verdict) to order a dismissal of the action without prejudice instead of granting judgment n.o.v. See <em>Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., supra</em>, 330 U.S. at 217, 218 67 S.Ct. at 755, 756, 91 L.Ed. 849. Subdivision (c)(2) is a reminder that the verdict-winner is entitled, even after entry of judgment n.o.v. against him, to move for a new trial in the usual course. If in these circumstances the motion is granted, the judgment is superseded.</p>
<p class="note-body">In some unusual circumstances, however, the grant of the new-trial motion may be only conditional, and the judgment will not be superseded. See the situation in <em>Tribble v. Bruin</em>, 279 F.2d 424 (4th Cir. 1960) (upon a verdict for plaintiff, defendant moves for and obtains judgment n.o.v.; plaintiff moves for a new trial on the ground of inadequate damages; trial court might properly have granted plaintiff's motion, conditional upon reversal of the judgment n.o.v.).</p>
<p class="note-body">Even if the verdict-winner makes no motion for a new trial, he is entitled upon his appeal from the judgment n.o.v. not only to urge that that judgment should be reversed and judgment entered upon the verdict, but that errors were committed during the trial which at the least entitle him to a new trial.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> deals with the situation where judgment has been entered on the jury verdict, the motion for judgment n.o.v. and any motion for a new trial having been denied by the trial court. The verdict-winner, as appellee, besides seeking to uphold the judgment, may urge upon the appellate court that in case the trial court is found to have erred in entering judgment on the verdict, there are grounds for granting him a new trial instead of directing the entry of judgment for his opponent. In appropriate cases the appellate court is not precluded from itself directing that a new trial be had. See <em>Weade v. Dichmann, Wright & Pugh, Inc</em>., 337 U.S. 801, 69 S.Ct. 1326, 93 L.Ed. 1704 (1949). Nor is it precluded in proper cases from remanding the case for a determination by the trial court as to whether a new trial should be granted. The latter course is advisable where the grounds urged are suitable for the exercise of trial court discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) does not attempt a regulation of all aspects of the procedure where the motion for judgment n.o.v. and any accompanying motion for a new trial are denied, since the problems have not been fully canvassed in the decisions and the procedure is in some respects still in a formative stage. It is, however, designed to give guidance on certain important features of the practice.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The revision of this subdivision aims to facilitate the exercise by the court of its responsibility to assure the fidelity of its judgment to the controlling law, a responsibility imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Cf. Galloway v. United States</em>, 319 U.S. 372 (1943).</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision abandons the familiar terminology of <em>direction of verdict</em> for several reasons. The term is misleading as a description of the relationship between judge and jury. It is also freighted with anachronisms some of which are the subject of the text of former subdivision (a) of this rule that is deleted in this revision. Thus, it should not be necessary to state in the text of this rule that a motion made pursuant to it is not a waiver of the right to jury trial, and only the antiquities of directed verdict practice suggest that it might have been. The term &ldquo;judgment as a matter of law&rdquo; is an almost equally familiar term and appears in the text of Rule 56; its use in Rule 50 calls attention to the relationship between the two rules. Finally, the change enables the rule to refer to preverdict and post-verdict motions with a terminology that does not conceal the common identity of two motions made at different times in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a motion is denominated a motion for directed verdict or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the party's error is merely formal. Such a motion should be treated as a motion for judgment as a matter of law in accordance with this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (a)(1) articulates the standard for the granting of a motion for judgment as a matter of law. It effects no change in the existing standard. That existing standard was not expressed in the former rule, but was articulated in long-standing case law. <em>See generally</em> Cooper, <em>Directions for Directed Verdicts: A Compass for Federal Courts</em>, 55 MINN. L. REV. 903 (1971). The expressed standard makes clear that action taken under the rule is a performance of the court's duty to assure enforcement of the controlling law and is not an intrusion on any responsibility for factual determinations conferred on the jury by the Seventh Amendment or any other provision of federal law. Because this standard is also used as a reference point for entry of summary judgment under 56(a), it serves to link the two related provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision authorizes the court to perform its duty to enter judgment as a matter of law at any time during the trial, as soon as it is apparent that either party is unable to carry a burden of proof that is essential to that party's case. Thus, the second sentence of paragraph (a)(1) authorizes the court to consider a motion for judgment as a matter of law as soon as a party has completed a presentation on a fact essential to that party's case. Such early action is appropriate when economy and expedition will be served. In no event, however, should the court enter judgment against a party who has not been apprised of the materiality of the dispositive fact and been afforded an opportunity to present any available evidence bearing on that fact. In order further to facilitate the exercise of the authority provided by this rule, Rule 16 is also revised to encourage the court to schedule an order of trial that proceeds first with a presentation on an issue that is likely to be dispositive, if such an issue is identified in the course of pretrial. Such scheduling can be appropriate where the court is uncertain whether favorable action should be taken under Rule 56. Thus, the revision affords the court the alternative of denying a motion for summary judgment while scheduling a separate trial of the issue under Rule 42(b) or scheduling the trial to begin with a presentation on that essential fact which the opposing party seems unlikely to be able to maintain.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (a)(2) retains the requirement that a motion for judgment be made prior to the close of the trial, subject to renewal after a jury verdict has been rendered. The purpose of this requirement is to assure the responding party an opportunity to cure any deficiency in that party's proof that may have been overlooked until called to the party's attention by a late motion for judgment. Cf. <em>Farley Transp. Co. v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co</em>., 786 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1986) (&ldquo;If the moving party is then permitted to make a later attack on the evidence through a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or an appeal, the opposing party may be prejudiced by having lost the opportunity to present additional evidence before the case was submitted to the jury&rdquo;); <em>Benson v. Allphin</em>, 786 F.2d 268 (7th Cir. 1986) (&ldquo;the motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence provides the nonmovant an opportunity to do what he can to remedy the deficiencies in his case .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.); <em>McLaughlin v. The Fellows Gear Shaper Co</em>., 4 F.R.Serv. 3d 607 (3d Cir. 1986) (per Adams, J., dissenting: &ldquo;This Rule serves important practical purposes in ensuring that neither party is precluded from presenting the most persuasive case possible and in preventing unfair surprise after a matter has been submitted to the jury&rdquo;). At one time, this requirement was held to be of constitutional stature, being compelled by <!-- PDFPage:244 -->the Seventh Amendment. Cf. <em>Slocum v. New York Insurance Co</em>., 228 U.S. 364 (1913). But cf. <em>Baltimore & Carolina Line v. Redman</em>, 295 U.S. 654 (1935).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) does impose a requirement that the moving party articulate the basis on which a judgment as a matter of law might be rendered. The articulation is necessary to achieve the purpose of the requirement that the motion be made before the case is submitted to the jury, so that the responding party may seek to correct any overlooked deficiencies in the proof. The revision thus alters the result in cases in which courts have used various techniques to avoid the requirement that a motion for a directed verdict be made as a predicate to a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. E.g., <em>Benson v. Allphin</em>, 788 F.2d 268 (7th cir. 1986) (&ldquo;this circuit has allowed something less than a formal motion for directed verdict to preserve a party's right to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict&rdquo;). <em>See generally</em> 9 WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE &sect;2537 (1971 and Supp.). The information required with the motion may be supplied by explicit reference to materials and argument previously supplied to the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision deals only with the entry of judgment and not with the resolution of particular factual issues as a matter of law. The court may, as before, properly refuse to instruct a jury to decide an issue if a reasonable jury could on the evidence presented decide that issue in only one way.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This provision retains the concept of the former rule that the post-verdict motion is a renewal of an earlier motion made at the close of the evidence. One purpose of this concept was to avoid any question arising under the Seventh Amendment. <em>Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan</em>, 311 U.S. 243 (1940). It remains useful as a means of defining the appropriate issue posed by the post-verdict motion. A post-trial motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the pre-verdict motion. <em>E.g., Kutner Buick, Inc. v. American Motors Corp</em>., 848 F.2d 614 (3d cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="note-body">Often it appears to the court or to the moving party that a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of the evidence should be reserved for a post-verdict decision. This is so because a jury verdict for the moving party moots the issue and because a pre-verdict ruling gambles that a reversal may result in a new trial that might have been avoided. For these reasons, the court may often wisely decline to rule on a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of the evidence, and it is not inappropriate for the moving party to suggest such a postponement of the ruling until after the verdict has been rendered.</p>
<p class="note-body">In ruling on such a motion, the court should disregard any jury determination for which there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis enabling a reasonable jury to make it. The court may then decide such issues as a matter of law and enter judgment if all other material issues have been decided by the jury on the basis of legally sufficient evidence, or by the court as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised rule is intended for use in this manner with Rule 49. Thus, the court may combine facts established as a matter of law either before trial under Rule 56 or at trial on the basis of the evidence presented with other facts determined by the jury under instructions provided under Rule 49 to support a proper judgment under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">This provision also retains the former requirement that a post-trial motion under the rule must be made within 10 days after entry of a contrary judgment. The renewed motion must be served and filed as provided by Rule 5. A purpose of this requirement is to meet the requirements of F.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Revision of this subdivision conforms the language to the change in diction set forth in subdivision (a) of this revised rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Revision of this subdivision conforms the language to that of the previous subdivisions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This technical amendment corrects an ambiguity in the text of the 1991 revision of the rule, which, as indicated in the Notes, was not intended to change the existing standards under which &ldquo;directed verdicts&rdquo; could be granted. This amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of law in jury trials may be entered against both plaintiffs and defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The only change, other than stylistic, intended by this revision is to prescribe a uniform explicit time for filing of post-judgment motions under this rule&mdash;no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment. Previously, there was an inconsistency in the wording of Rules 50, 52, and 59 with respect to whether certain post-judgment motions had to be filed, or merely served, during that period. This inconsistency caused special problems when motions for a new trial were joined with other post-judgment motions. These motions affect the finality of the judgment, a matter often of importance to third persons as well as the parties and the court. The Committee believes that each of these rules should be revised to require filing before end of the 10-day period. Filing is an event that can be determined with certainty from court records. The phrase &ldquo;no later than&rdquo; is used&mdash;rather than &ldquo;within&rdquo;&mdash;to include post-judgment motions that sometimes are filed before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. It should be noted that under Rule 6(a) Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in measuring the 10-day period, and that under Rule 5 the motions when filed are to contain a certificate of service on other parties.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2006 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 50(a) has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 50(b) is amended to permit renewal of any Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law, deleting the requirement that a motion be made at the close of all the evidence. Because the Rule 50(b) motion is only a renewal of the preverdict motion, it can be granted only on grounds advanced in the preverdict motion. The earlier motion informs the opposing party of the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and affords a clear opportunity to provide additional evidence that may be available. The earlier motion also alerts the court to the opportunity to simplify the trial by resolving some issues, or even all issues, without submission to the jury. This fulfillment of the functional needs that underlie present Rule 50(b) also satisfies the Seventh Amendment. Automatic reservation of the legal questions raised by the motion conforms to the decision in <em>Baltimore & Carolina Line v. Redman</em>, 297 U.S. 654 (1935).</p>
<p class="note-body">This change responds to many decisions that have begun to move away from requiring a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the literal close of all the evidence. Although the requirement has been clearly established for several decades, lawyers continue to overlook it. The courts are slowly working away from the formal requirement. The amendment establishes the functional approach that courts have been unable to reach under the present rule and makes practice more consistent and predictable.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many judges expressly invite motions at the close of all the evidence. The amendment is not intended to discourage this useful practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, an explicit time limit is added for making a posttrial motion when the trial ends without a verdict or with a verdict that does not dispose of all issues <!-- PDFPage:245 -->suitable for resolution by verdict. The motion must be made no later than 10 days after the jury was discharged.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. This recommendation modifies the version of the proposal as published. The only changes made in the rule text after publication are matters of style. One sentence in the Committee Note was changed by adopting the wording of the 1991 Committee Note describing the grounds that may be used to support a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. A paragraph also was added to the Committee Note to explain the style revisions in subdivision (a). The changes from the published rule text are set out below. [Omitted]</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 50 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 50(b) stated that the court reserves ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence &ldquo;[i]f, for any reason, the court does not grant&rdquo; the motion. The words &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; reflected the proposition that the reservation is automatic and inescapable. The ruling is reserved even if the court explicitly denies the motion. The same result follows under the amended rule. If the motion is not granted, the ruling is reserved.</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended Rule 50(e) identifies the appellate court's authority to direct the entry of judgment. This authority was not described in former Rule 50(d), but was recognized in <em>Weisgram v. Marley Co.</em>, 528 U.S. 440 (2000), and in <em>Neely v. Martin K. Eby Construction Company</em>, 386 U.S. 317 (1967). When Rule 50(d) was drafted in 1963, the Committee Note stated that &ldquo;[s]ubdivision (d) does not attempt a regulation of all aspects of the procedure where the motion for judgment n.o.v. and any accompanying motion for a new trial are denied *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; Express recognition of the authority to direct entry of judgment does not otherwise supersede this caution.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Former Rules 50, 52, and 59 adopted 10-day periods for their respective post-judgment motions. Rule 6(b) prohibits any expansion of those periods. Experience has proved that in many cases it is not possible to prepare a satisfactory post-judgment motion in 10 days, even under the former rule that excluded intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. These time periods are particularly sensitive because Appellate Rule 4 integrates the time to appeal with a timely motion under these rules. Rather than introduce the prospect of uncertainty in appeal time by amending Rule 6(b) to permit additional time, the former 10-day periods are expanded to 28 days. Rule 6(b) continues to prohibit expansion of the 28-day period.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made after Publication and Comment</em>. The 30-day period proposed in the August 2007 publication is shortened to 28 days.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">Supreme Court Rule 8 requires exceptions to the charge of the court to the jury which shall distinctly state the several matters of law in the charge to which exception is taken. Similar provisions appear in the rules of the various Circuit Courts of Appeals.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Although Rule 51 in its present form specifies that the court shall instruct the jury only after the arguments of the parties are completed, in some districts (typically those in states where the practice is otherwise) it is common for the parties to stipulate to instruction before the arguments. The purpose of the amendment is to give the court discretion to instruct the jury either before or after argument. Thus, the rule as revised will permit resort to the long-standing federal practice or to an alternative procedure, which has been praised because it gives counsel the opportunity to explain the instructions, argue their application to the facts and thereby give the jury the maximum assistance in determining the issues and arriving at a good verdict on the law and the evidence. As an ancillary benefit, this approach aids counsel by supplying a <!-- PDFPage:246 -->natural outline so that arguments may be directed to the essential fact issues which the jury must decide. See generally Raymond, <em>Merits and Demerits of the Missouri System of Instructing Juries</em>, 5 St. Louis U.L.J. 317 (1959). Moreover, if the court instructs before an argument, counsel then know the precise words the court has chosen and need not speculate as to the words the court will later use in its instructions. Finally, by instructing ahead of argument the court has the attention of the jurors when they are fresh and can given their full attention to the court's instructions. It is more difficult to hold the attention of jurors after lengthy arguments.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 51 is revised to capture many of the interpretations that have emerged in practice. The revisions in text will make uniform the conclusions reached by a majority of decisions on each point. Additions also are made to cover some practices that cannot now be anchored in the text of Rule 51.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Scope</em>. Rule 51 governs instructions to the trial jury on the law that governs the verdict. A variety of other instructions cannot practicably be brought within Rule 51. Among these instructions are preliminary instructions to a venire, and cautionary or limiting instructions delivered in immediate response to events at trial.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Requests</em>. Subdivision (a) governs requests. Apart from the plain error doctrine recognized in subdivision (d)(2), a court is not obliged to instruct the jury on issues raised by the evidence unless a party requests an instruction. The revised rule recognizes the court's authority to direct that requests be submitted before trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The close-of-the-evidence deadline may come before trial is completed on all potential issues. Trial may be formally bifurcated or may be sequenced in some less formal manner. The close of the evidence is measured by the occurrence of two events: completion of all intended evidence on an identified phase of the trial and impending submission to the jury with instructions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The risk in directing a pretrial request deadline is that trial evidence may raise new issues or reshape issues the parties thought they had understood. Courts need not insist on pretrial requests in all cases. Even if the request time is set before trial or early in the trial, subdivision (a)(2)(A) permits requests after the close of the evidence to address issues that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the earlier time for requests set by the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(2)(B) expressly recognizes the court's discretion to act on an untimely request. The most important consideration in exercising the discretion confirmed by subdivision (a)(2)(B) is the importance of the issue to the case&mdash;the closer the issue lies to the &ldquo;plain error&rdquo; that would be recognized under subdivision (d)(2), the better the reason to give an instruction. The cogency of the reason for failing to make a timely request also should be considered. To be considered under subdivision (a)(2)(B) a request should be made before final instructions and before final jury arguments. What is a &ldquo;final&rdquo; instruction and argument depends on the sequence of submitting the case to the jury. If separate portions of the case are submitted to the jury in sequence, the final arguments and final instructions are those made on submitting to the jury the portion of the case addressed by the arguments and instructions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Instructions</em>. Subdivision (b)(1) requires the court to inform the parties, before instructing the jury and before final jury arguments related to the instruction, of the proposed instructions as well as the proposed action on instruction requests. The time limit is addressed to final jury arguments to reflect the practice that allows interim arguments during trial in complex cases; it may not be feasible to develop final instructions before such interim arguments. It is enough that counsel know of the intended instructions before making final arguments addressed to the issue. If the trial is sequenced or bifurcated, the final arguments addressed to an issue may occur before the close of the entire trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) complements subdivision (b)(1) by carrying forward the opportunity to object established by present Rule 51. It makes explicit the opportunity to object on the record, ensuring a clear memorial of the objection.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) reflects common practice by authorizing instructions at any time after trial begins and before the jury is discharged.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Objections</em>. Subdivision (c) states the right to object to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction. It carries forward the formula of present Rule 51 requiring that the objection state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection, and makes explicit the requirement that the objection be made on the record. The provisions on the time to object make clear that it is timely to object promptly after learning of an instruction or action on a request when the court has not provided advance information as required by subdivision (b)(1). The need to repeat a request by way of objection is continued by new subdivision (d)(1)(B) except where the court made a definitive ruling on the record.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Preserving a claim of error and plain error</em>. Many cases hold that a proper request for a jury instruction is not alone enough to preserve the right to appeal failure to give the instruction. The request must be renewed by objection. This doctrine is appropriate when the court may not have sufficiently focused on the request, or may believe that the request has been granted in substance although in different words. But this doctrine may also prove a trap for the unwary who fail to add an objection after the court has made it clear that the request has been considered and rejected on the merits. Subdivision (d)(1)(B) establishes authority to review the failure to grant a timely request, despite a failure to add an objection, when the court has made a definitive ruling on the record rejecting the request.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many circuits have recognized that an error not preserved under Rule 51 may be reviewed in exceptional circumstances. The language adopted to capture these decisions in subdivision (d)(2) is borrowed from Criminal Rule 52. Although the language is the same, the context of civil litigation often differs from the context of criminal prosecution; actual application of the plain-error standard takes account of the differences. The Supreme Court has summarized application of Criminal Rule 52 as involving four elements: (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Johnson v. U.S.</em>, 520 U.S. 461, 466&ndash;467, 469&ndash;470 (1997). (The Johnson case quoted the fourth element from its decision in a civil action, <em>U.S. v. Atkinson</em>, 297 U.S. 157, 160 (1936): &ldquo;In exceptional circumstances, especially in criminal cases, appellate courts, in the public interest, may, of their own motion, notice errors to which no exception has been taken, if the errors are obvious, or if they otherwise substantially affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.&rdquo;)</p>
<p class="note-body">The court's duty to give correct jury instructions in a civil action is shaped by at least four factors.</p>
<p class="note-body">The factor most directly implied by a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; error rule is the obviousness of the mistake. The importance of the error is a second major factor. The costs of correcting an error reflect a third factor that is affected by a variety of circumstances. In a case that seems close to the fundamental error line, account also may be taken of the impact a verdict may have on nonparties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. The changes made after publication and comment are indicated by double-underlining and overstriking on the texts that were published in August 2001.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 51(d) was revised to conform the plain-error provision to the approach taken in Criminal Rule 52(b). The Note was revised as described in the Recommendation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 52. Findings and Conclusions by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings and Conclusions.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> In an action tried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately. The findings and conclusions may be stated on the record after the close of the evidence or may appear in an opinion or a memorandum of decision filed by the court. Judgment must be entered under Rule 58.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>For an Interlocutory Injunction.</em> In granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction, the court must similarly state the findings and conclusions that support its action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>For a Motion.</em> The court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under Rule 12 or 56 or, unless these rules provide otherwise, on any other motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Effect of a Master's Findings.</em> A master's findings, to the extent adopted by the court, must be considered the court's findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Questioning the Evidentiary Support.</em> A party may later question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings, whether or not the party requested findings, objected to them, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Setting Aside the Findings.</em> Findings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the witnesses&rsquo; credibility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Amended or Additional Findings.</cap-smallcap> On a party's motion filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings&mdash;or make additional findings&mdash;and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Judgment on Partial Findings.</cap-smallcap> If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a nonjury trial and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue. The court may, however, decline to render any judgment until the close of the evidence. A judgment on partial findings must be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).</p>

<p class="note-body">See [former] Equity Rule 701/2, as amended Nov. 25, 1935 (Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law), and U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;764 (Opinion, findings, and conclusions in action against United States) which are substantially continued in this rule. The provisions of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;773 (Trial of issues of fact; by court) and [former] 875 (Review in cases tried without a jury) are superseded insofar as they provide a different method of finding facts and a different method of appellate review. The rule stated in the third sentence of <em>Subdivision (a</em>) accords with the decisions on the scope of the review in modern federal equity practice. It is applicable to all classes of findings in cases tried without a jury whether the finding is of a fact concerning which there was conflict of testimony, or of a fact deduced or inferred from uncontradicted testimony. See <em>Silver King Coalition Mines, Co. v. Silver King Consolidated Mining Co</em>., 204 Fed. 166 (C.C.A.8th, 1913), cert. den. 229 U.S. 624 (1913); <em>Warren v.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amended rule makes clear that the requirement for findings of fact and conclusions of law thereon applies in a case with an advisory jury. This removes an ambiguity in the rule as originally stated, but carries into effect what has been considered its intent. 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 3119; <em>Hurwitz v. Hurwitz</em> (App.D.C. 1943) 136 F.(2d) 796.</p>
<p class="note-body">The two sentences added at the end of Rule 52(a) eliminate certain difficulties which have arisen concerning findings and conclusions. The first of the two sentences permits findings of fact and conclusions of law to appear in an opinion or memorandum of decision. See, <em>e.g., United States v. One 1941 Ford Sedan</em> (S.D.Tex. 1946) 65 F.Supp. 84. Under original Rule 52(a) some courts have expressed the view that findings and conclusions could not be incorporated in an opinion. <em>Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications</em> (S.D.N.Y. 1939) 28 F.Supp. 399; <em>Pennsylvania Co. for Insurance on Lives & Granting Annuities v. Cincinnati & L. E. R. Co</em>. (S.D.Ohio 1941) 43 F.Supp. 5; <em>United States v. Aluminum Co. of America</em> (S.D.N.Y. 1941) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 52a.11, Case 3; see also s.c., 44 F.Supp. 97. But, to the contrary, see <em>Wellman v. United States</em> (D.Mass. 1938) 25 F.Supp. 868; <em>Cook v. United States</em> (D.Mass. 1939) 26 F.Supp. 253; <em>Proctor v. White</em> (D.Mass. 1939) 28 F.Supp. 161; <em>Green Valley Creamery, Inc. v. United States</em> (C.C.A.1st, 1939) 108 F.(2d) 342. See also <em>Matton Oil Transfer Corp. v. The Dynamic</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1941) 123 F.(2d) 999; <em>Carter Coal Co. v. Litz</em> (C.C.A.4th, 1944) 140 F.(2d) 934; <em>Woodruff v. Heiser</em> (C.C.A.10th, 1945) 150 F.(2d) 869; <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Busch</em> (E.D.Pa. 1943) 7 Fed.Rules Serv. 59b.2, Case 4; Oglebay, <em>Some Developments in Bankruptcy Law</em> (1944) 18 J. of Nat'l Ass'n of Ref. 68, 69. Findings of fact aid in the process of judgment and in defining for future cases the precise limitations of the issues and the determination thereon. Thus they not only aid the appellate court on review (<em>Hurwitz v. Hurwitz</em> (App.D.C. 1943) 136 F.(2d) 796) but they are an important factor in the proper application of the doctrines of res judicata and estoppel by judgment. Nordbye, <em>Improvements in Statement of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</em>, 1 F.R.D. 25, 26&ndash;27; <em>United States v. Forness</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 125 F.(2d) 928, cert. den. (1942) 316 U.S. 694. These findings should represent the judge's own determination and not the long, often argumentative statements of successful counsel. <em>United States v. Forness, supra; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co</em>. (1944) 323 U.S. 173. Consequently, they should be a part of the judge's opinion and decision, either stated therein or stated separately. <em>Matton Oil Transfer Corp. v. The Dynamic, supra</em>. But the judge need only make brief, definite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon the contested matters; there is no necessity for over-elaboration of detail or particularization of facts. <em>United States v. Forness, supra; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., supra</em>. See also <em>Petterson Lighterage & Towing Corp. v. New York Central R. Co</em>. (C.C.A.2d, 1942) 126 F.(2d) 992; <em>Brown Paper Mill Co., Inc. v. Irwin</em> (C.C.A.8th, 1943) 134 F.(2d) 337; <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3</em>, I.B.E.W. (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 145 F.(2d) 215, rev'd on other grounds (1945) 325 U.S. 797; <em>Young v. Murphy</em> (N.D.Ohio 1946) 9 Fed.Rules Serv. 52a.11, Case 2.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of Rule 52(a) as amended will remove any doubt that findings and conclusions are unnecessary upon decision of a motion, particularly one under Rule 12 or Rule 56, except as provided in amended Rule 41(b). As so holding, see <em>Thomas v. Peyser</em> (App.D.C. 1941) 118 F.(2d) 369; <em>Schad v. Twentieth Century-Fox Corp</em>. (C.C.A.3d, 1943) 136 F.(2d) 991; <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Goldstein</em> (E.D.N.Y. 1942) 43 F.Supp. 767; <em>Somers Coal Co. v. United States</em> (N.D.Ohio 1942) 6 Fed.Rules Serv. 52a.1, Case 1; <em>Pen-Ken Oil & Gas Corp. v. Warfield Natural Gas Co</em>. (E.D.Ky. 1942) 5 Fed.Rules Serv. 52a.1, Case 3; also Commentary, <em>Necessity of Findings of Fact</em> (1941) 4 Fed.Rules Serv. 936.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 58. See the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 58, as amended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 52(a) has been amended to revise its penultimate sentence to provide explicitly that the district judge may make the findings of fact and conclusions of law required in nonjury cases orally. Nothing in the prior text of the rule forbids this practice, which is widely utilized by district judges. See Christensen, <em>A Modest Proposal for Immeasurable Improvement</em>, 64 A.B.A.J. 693 (1978). The objective is to lighten the burden on the trial court in preparing findings in nonjury cases. In addition, the amendment should reduce the number of published district court opinions that embrace written findings.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 52(a) has been amended (1) to avoid continued confusion and conflicts among the circuits as to the standard of appellate review of findings of fact by the court, (2) to eliminate the disparity between the standard of review as literally stated in Rule 52(a) and the practice of some courts of appeals, and (3) to promote nationwide uniformity. See Note, <em>Rule 52(a): Appellate Review of Findings of Fact Based on Documentary or Undisputed Evidence</em>, 49 Va. L. Rev. 506, 536 (1963).</p>
<p class="note-body">Some courts of appeal have stated that when a trial court's findings do not rest on demeanor evidence and evaluation of a witness&rsquo; credibility, there is no reason to defer to the trial court's findings and the appellate court more readily can find them to be clearly erroneous. See, e.g., <em>Marcum v. United States</em>, 621 F.2d 142, 144&ndash;45 (5th Cir. 1980). Others go further, holding that appellate review may be had without application of the &ldquo;clearly erroneous&rdquo; test since the appellate court is in as good a position as the trial court to review a purely documentary record. See, <em>e.g., Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp</em>., 672 F.2d 607, 614 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 880 (1982); <em>Lydle v. United States</em>, 635 F.2d 763, 765 n. 1 (6th Cir. 1981); <em>Swanson v. Baker Indus., Inc</em>., 615 F.2d 479, 483 (8th Cir. 1980); <em>Taylor v. Lombard</em>, 606 F.2d 371, 372 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied</em>, 445 U.S. 946 (1980); <em>Jack Kahn Music Co. v. Baldwin Piano & Organ Co</em>., 604 F.2d 755, 758 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>John R. Thompson Co. v. United States</em>, 477 F.2d 164, 167 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>
<p class="note-body">A third group has adopted the view that the &ldquo;clearly erroneous&rdquo; rule applies in all nonjury cases even when findings are based solely on documentary evidence or on inferences from undisputed facts. See, <em>e.g., Maxwell v. Sumner</em>, 673 F.2d 1031, 1036 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 976 (1982); <em>United States v. Texas Education Agency</em>, 647 F.2d 504, 506&ndash;07 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied</em>, 454 U.S. 1143 (1982); <em>Constructora Maza, Inc. v. Banco de Ponce</em>, 616 F.2d 573, 576 (1st Cir. 1980); <em>In re Sierra Trading Corp</em>., 482 F.2d 333, 337 (10th Cir. 1973); <em>Case v. Morrisette</em>, 475 F.2d 1300, 1306&ndash;07 (D.C. Cir. 1973).</p>
<p class="note-body">The commentators also disagree as to the proper interpretation of the Rule. <em>Compare</em> Wright, <em>The Doubtful Omniscience of Appellate Courts</em>, 41 Minn. L. Rev. 751, 769&ndash;70 (1957) (language and intent of Rule support view that &ldquo;clearly erroneous&rdquo; test should apply to all forms of evidence), <em>and</em> 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil &sect;2587</em>, at 740 (1971) (language of the Rule is clear), <em>with</em> 5A J. Moore, <em>Federal Practice &nbsp;52.04, 2687&ndash;88 (2d ed. 1982) (Rule as written supports broader review of findings based on non-demeanor testimony).</em></p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court has not clearly resolved the issue. See, <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc</em>., 466 U.S. 485, 104 S. Ct. 1949, 1958 (1984); <em>Pullman Standard v. Swint</em>, 456 U.S. 273, 293 (1982); <em>United States v. General Motors Corp</em>., 384 U.S. 127, 141 n. 16 <!-- PDFPage:249 -->(1966); <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co</em>., 333 U.S. 364, 394&ndash;96 (1948).</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal argument advanced in favor of a more searching appellate review of findings by the district court based solely on documentary evidence is that the rationale of Rule 52(a) does not apply when the findings do not rest on the trial court's assessment of credibility of the witnesses but on an evaluation of documentary proof and the drawing of inferences from it, thus eliminating the need for any special deference to the trial court's findings. These considerations are outweighed by the public interest in the stability and judicial economy that would be promoted by recognizing that the trial court, not the appellate tribunal, should be the finder of the facts. To permit courts of appeals to share more actively in the fact-finding function would tend to undermine the legitimacy of the district courts in the eyes of litigants, multiply appeals by encouraging appellate retrial of some factual issues, and needlessly reallocate judicial authority.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is added. It parallels the revised Rule 50(a), but is applicable to non-jury trials. It authorizes the court to enter judgment at any time that it can appropriately make a dispositive finding of fact on the evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new subdivision replaces part of Rule 41(b), which formerly authorized a dismissal at the close of the plaintiff's case if the plaintiff had failed to carry an essential burden of proof. Accordingly, the reference to Rule 41 formerly made in subdivision (a) of this rule is deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">As under the former Rule 41(b), the court retains discretion to enter no judgment prior to the close of the evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Judgment entered under this rule differs from a summary judgment under Rule 56 in the nature of the evaluation made by the court. A judgment on partial findings is made after the court has heard all the evidence bearing on the crucial issue of fact, and the finding is reversible only if the appellate court finds it to be &ldquo;clearly erroneous.&rdquo; A summary judgment, in contrast, is made on the basis of facts established on account of the absence of contrary evidence or presumptions; such establishments of fact are rulings on questions of law as provided in Rule 56(a) and are not shielded by the &ldquo;clear error&rdquo; standard of review.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This technical amendment corrects an ambiguity in the text of the 1991 revision of the rule, similar to the revision being made to Rule 50. This amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of law in nonjury trials may be entered against both plaintiffs and defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The only change, other than stylistic, intended by this revision is to require that any motion to amend or add findings after a nonjury trial must be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment. Previously, there was an inconsistency in the wording of Rules 50, 52, and 59 with respect to whether certain post-judgment motions had to be filed, or merely served, during that period. This inconsistency caused special problems when motions for a new trial were joined with other post-judgment motions. These motions affect the finality of the judgment, a matter often of importance to third persons as well as the parties and the court. The Committee believes that each of these rules should be revised to require filing before end of the 10-day period. Filing is an event that can be determined with certainty from court records. The phrase &ldquo;no later than&rdquo; is used&mdash;rather than &ldquo;within&rdquo;&mdash;to include post-judgment motions that sometimes are filed before actual entry of the judgment by the clerk. It should be noted that under Rule 6(a) Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded in measuring the 10-day period, and that under Rule 5 the motions when filed are to contain a certificate of service on other parties.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 52 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 52(a) said that findings are unnecessary on decisions of motions &ldquo;except as provided in subdivision (c) of this rule.&rdquo; Amended Rule 52(a)(3) says that findings are unnecessary &ldquo;unless these rules provide otherwise.&rdquo; This change reflects provisions in other rules that require Rule 52 findings on deciding motions. Rules 23(e), 23(h), and 54(d)(2)(C) are examples.</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended Rule 52(a)(5) includes provisions that appeared in former Rule 52(a) and 52(b). Rule 52(a) provided that requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of review. It applied both in an action tried on the facts without a jury and also in granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction. Rule 52(b), applicable to findings &ldquo;made in actions tried without a jury,&rdquo; provided that the sufficiency of the evidence might be &ldquo;later questioned whether or not in the district court the party raising the question objected to the findings, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.&rdquo; Former Rule 52(b) did not explicitly apply to decisions granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction. Amended Rule 52(a)(5) makes explicit the application of this part of former Rule 52(b) to interlocutory injunction decisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 52(c) provided for judgment on partial findings, and referred to it as &ldquo;judgment as a matter of law.&rdquo; Amended Rule 52(c) refers only to &ldquo;judgment,&rdquo; to avoid any confusion with a Rule 50 judgment as a matter of law in a jury case. The standards that govern judgment as a matter of law in a jury case have no bearing on a decision under Rule 52(c).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Former Rules 50, 52, and 59 adopted 10-day periods for their respective post-judgment motions. Rule 6(b) prohibits any expansion of those periods. Experience has proved that in many cases it is not possible to prepare a satisfactory post-judgment motion in 10 days, even under the former rule that excluded intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. These time periods are particularly sensitive because Appellate Rule 4 integrates the time to appeal with a timely motion under these rules. Rather than introduce the prospect of uncertainty in appeal time by amending Rule 6(b) to permit additional time, the former 10-day periods are expanded to 28 days. Rule 6(b) continues to prohibit expansion of the 28-day period.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made after Publication and Comment</em>. The 30-day period proposed in the August 2007 publication is shortened to 28 days.</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">These changes are designed to preserve the admiralty practice whereby difficult computations are referred to a commissioner or assessor, especially after an interlocutory judgment determining liability. As to separation of issues for trial see Rule 42(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The creation of full-time magistrates, who serve at government expense and have no nonjudicial duties competing for their time, eliminates the need to appoint standing masters. Thus the prior provision in Rule 53(a) authorizing the appointment of standing masters is deleted. Additionally, the definition of &ldquo;master&rdquo; in subdivision (a) now eliminates the superseded office of commissioner.</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;special master&rdquo; is retained in Rule 53 in order to maintain conformity with 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(2), authorizing a judge to designate a magistrate &ldquo;to serve as a special master pursuant to the applicable provisions of this title and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts.&rdquo; Obviously, when a magistrate serves as a special master, the provisions for compensation of masters are inapplicable, and the amendment to subdivision (a) so provides.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the existence of magistrates may make the appointment of outside masters unnecessary in many instances, see, <em>e.g., Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority</em>, 384 F.Supp. 37 (N.D.Ill. 1974), mandamus denied <em>sub nom., Chicago Housing Authority v. Austin</em>, 511 F.2d 82 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Avco Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co</em>., 68 F.R.D. 532 (S.D. Ohio 1975), such masters may prove useful when some special expertise is desired or when a magistrate is unavailable for lengthy and detailed supervision of a case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(2) not only permit magistrates to serve as masters under Rule 53(b) but also eliminate the exceptional condition requirement of Rule 53(b) when the reference is made with the consent of the parties. The amendment to subdivision (b) brings Rule 53 into harmony with the statute by exempting magistrates, appointed with the consent of the parties, from the general requirement that some exceptional condition requires the reference. It should be noted that subdivision (b) does not address the question, raised in recent decisional law and commentary, as to whether the exceptional condition requirement is applicable when <em>private masters </em>who are not magistrates are appointed with the consent of the parties. See Silberman, <em>Masters and Magistrates Part II: The American Analogue</em>, 50 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1297, 1354 (1975).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The amendment recognizes the abrogation of Federal Rule 43(c) by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. The new subdivision responds to confusion flowing from the dual authority for references of pretrial matters to magistrates. Such references can be made, with or without the consent of the parties, pursuant to Rule 53 or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B). There are a number of distinctions between references made under the statute and under the rule. For example, under the statute nondispositive pretrial matters may be referred to a magistrate, without consent, for final determination with reconsideration by the district judge if the magistrate's order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law. Under the rule, however, the appointment of a master, without consent of the parties, to supervise discovery would require some exceptional condition (Rule 53(b)) and would subject the proceedings to the report procedures of Rule 53(e). If an order of reference does not clearly articulate the source of the court's authority the resulting proceedings could be subject to attack on grounds of the magistrate's noncompliance with the provisions of Rule 53. This subdivision therefore establishes a presumption that the limitations of Rule 53 are not applicable unless the reference is specifically made subject to Rule 53.</p>
<p class="note-body">A magistrate serving as a special master under 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(2) is governed by the provisions of Rule 53, with the exceptional condition requirement lifted in the case of a consensual reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the revision is to expedite proceedings before a master. The former rule required only a filing of the master's report, with the clerk then notifying the parties of the filing. To receive a copy, a party would then be required to secure it from the clerk. By transmitting directly to the parties, the master can save some efforts of counsel. Some local rules have previously required such action by the master.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This revision is made to conform the rule to changes made by the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 53 is revised extensively to reflect changing practices in using masters. From the beginning in 1938, Rule 53 focused primarily on special masters who perform trial functions. Since then, however, courts have gained experience with masters appointed to perform a variety of pretrial and post-trial functions. See Willging, Hooper, Leary, Miletich, Reagan, & Shapard, <!-- PDFPage:252 --><em>Special Masters&rsquo; Incidence and Activity</em> (Federal Judicial Center 2000). This revised Rule 53 recognizes that in appropriate circumstances masters may properly be appointed to perform these functions and regulates such appointments. Rule 53 continues to address trial masters as well, but permits appointment of a trial master in an action to be tried to a jury only if the parties consent. The new rule clarifies the provisions that govern the appointment and function of masters for all purposes. Rule 53(g) also changes the standard of review for findings of fact made or recommended by a master. The core of the original Rule 53 remains, including its prescription that appointment of a master must be the exception and not the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Special masters are appointed in many circumstances outside the Civil Rules. Rule 53 applies only to proceedings that Rule 1 brings within its reach.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)</em>. District judges bear primary responsibility for the work of their courts. A master should be appointed only in limited circumstances. Subdivision (a)(1) describes three different standards, relating to appointments by consent of the parties, appointments for trial duties, and appointments for pretrial or post-trial duties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Consent Masters</em>. Subparagraph (a)(1)(A) authorizes appointment of a master with the parties&rsquo; consent. Party consent does not require that the court make the appointment; the court retains unfettered discretion to refuse appointment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Trial Masters</em>. Use of masters for the core functions of trial has been progressively limited. These limits are reflected in the provisions of subparagraph (a)(1)(B) that restrict appointments to exercise trial functions. The Supreme Court gave clear direction to this trend in <em>La Buy v. Howes Leather Co.</em>, 352 U.S. 249 (1957); earlier roots are sketched in <em>Los Angeles Brush Mfg. Corp. v. James</em>, 272 U.S. 701 (1927). As to nonjury trials, this trend has developed through elaboration of the &ldquo;exceptional condition&rdquo; requirement in present Rule 53(b). This phrase is retained, and will continue to have the same force as it has developed. Although the provision that a reference &ldquo;shall be the exception and not the rule&rdquo; is deleted, its meaning is embraced for this setting by the exceptional condition requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (a)(1)(B)(ii) carries forward the approach of present Rule 53(b), which exempts from the &ldquo;exceptional condition&rdquo; requirement &ldquo;matters of account and of difficult computation of damages.&rdquo; This approach is justified only as to essentially ministerial determinations that require mastery of much detailed information but that do not require extensive determinations of credibility. Evaluations of witness credibility should only be assigned to a trial master when justified by an exceptional condition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of a trial master without party consent is abolished as to matters to be decided by a jury unless a statute provides for this practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Abolition of the direct power to appoint a trial master as to issues to be decided by a jury leaves the way free to appoint a trial master with the consent of all parties. A trial master should be appointed in a jury case, with consent of the parties and concurrence of the court, only if the parties waive jury trial with respect to the issues submitted to the master or if the master's findings are to be submitted to the jury as evidence in the manner provided by former Rule 53(e)(3). In no circumstance may a master be appointed to preside at a jury trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The central function of a trial master is to preside over an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the claims or defenses in the action. This function distinguishes the trial master from most functions of pretrial and post-trial masters. If any master is to be used for such matters as a preliminary injunction hearing or a determination of complex damages issues, for example, the master should be a trial master. The line, however, is not distinct. A pretrial master might well conduct an evidentiary hearing on a discovery dispute, and a post-trial master might conduct evidentiary hearings on questions of compliance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 53 has long provided authority to report the evidence without recommendations in nonjury trials. This authority is omitted from Rule 53(a)(1)(B). In some circumstances a master may be appointed under Rule 53(a)(1)(A) or (C) to take evidence and report without recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body">For nonjury cases, a master also may be appointed to assist the court in discharging trial duties other than conducting an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Pretrial and Post-Trial Masters</em>. Subparagraph (a)(1)(C) authorizes appointment of a master to address pretrial or post-trial matters. Appointment is limited to matters that cannot be addressed effectively and in a timely fashion by an available district judge or magistrate judge of the district. A master's pretrial or post-trial duties may include matters that could be addressed by a judge, such as reviewing discovery documents for privilege, or duties that might not be suitable for a judge. Some forms of settlement negotiations, investigations, or administration of an organization are familiar examples of duties that a judge might not feel free to undertake.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Magistrate Judges</em>. Particular attention should be paid to the prospect that a magistrate judge may be available for special assignments. United States magistrate judges are authorized by statute to perform many pretrial functions in civil actions. 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(1). Ordinarily a district judge who delegates these functions should refer them to a magistrate judge acting as magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is statutory authority to appoint a magistrate judge as special master. 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b)(2). In special circumstances, or when expressly authorized by a statute other than &sect;636(b)(2), it may be appropriate to appoint a magistrate judge as a master when needed to perform functions outside those listed in &sect;636(b)(1). There is no apparent reason to appoint a magistrate judge to perform as master duties that could be performed in the role of magistrate judge. Party consent is required for trial before a magistrate judge, moreover, and this requirement should not be undercut by resort to Rule 53 unless specifically authorized by statute; see 42 U.S.C. &sect;2000e&ndash;5(f)(5).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Pretrial Masters</em>. The appointment of masters to participate in pretrial proceedings has developed extensively over the last two decades as some district courts have felt the need for additional help in managing complex litigation. This practice is not well regulated by present Rule 53, which focuses on masters as trial participants. Rule 53 is amended to confirm the authority to appoint&mdash;and to regulate the use of&mdash;pretrial masters.</p>
<p class="note-body">A pretrial master should be appointed only when the need is clear. Direct judicial performance of judicial functions may be particularly important in cases that involve important public issues or many parties. At the extreme, a broad delegation of pretrial responsibility as well as a delegation of trial responsibilities can run afoul of Article III.</p>
<p class="note-body">A master also may be appointed to address matters that blur the divide between pretrial and trial functions. The court's responsibility to interpret patent claims as a matter of law, for example, may be greatly assisted by appointing a master who has expert knowledge of the field in which the patent operates. Review of the master's findings will be de novo under Rule 53(g)(4), but the advantages of initial determination by a master may make the process more effective and timely than disposition by the judge acting alone. Determination of foreign law may present comparable difficulties. The decision whether to appoint a master to address such matters is governed by subdivision (a)(1)(C), not the trial-master provisions of subdivision (a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Post-Trial Masters</em>. Courts have come to rely on masters to assist in framing and enforcing complex decrees. Present Rule 53 does not directly address this practice. Amended Rule 53 authorizes appointment of post-trial masters for these and similar purposes. The constraint of subdivision (a)(1)(C) limits this practice to cases in <!-- PDFPage:253 -->which the master's duties cannot be performed effectively and in a timely fashion by an available district judge or magistrate judge of the district.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reliance on a master is appropriate when a complex decree requires complex policing, particularly when a party has proved resistant or intransigent. This practice has been recognized by the Supreme Court, see <em>Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers&rsquo; Internat. Assn. v. EEOC</em>, 478 U.S. 421, 481&ndash;482 (1986). The master's role in enforcement may extend to investigation in ways that are quite unlike the traditional role of judicial officers in an adversary system.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Expert Witness Overlap</em>. This rule does not address the difficulties that arise when a single person is appointed to perform overlapping roles as master and as court-appointed expert witness under Evidence Rule 706. Whatever combination of functions is involved, the Rule 53(a)(1)(B) limit that confines trial masters to issues to be decided by the court does not apply to a person who also is appointed as an expert witness under Evidence Rule 706.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2) and (3)</em>. Masters are subject to the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, with exceptions spelled out in the Code. Special care must be taken to ensure that there is no actual or apparent conflict of interest involving a master. The standard of disqualification is established by 28 U.S.C. &sect;455. The affidavit required by Rule 53(b)(3) provides an important source of information about possible grounds for disqualification, but careful inquiry should be made at the time of making the initial appointment. The disqualification standards established by &sect;455 are strict. Because a master is not a public judicial officer, it may be appropriate to permit the parties to consent to appointment of a particular person as master in circumstances that would require disqualification of a judge. The judge must be careful to ensure that no party feels any pressure to consent, but with such assurances&mdash;and with the judge's own determination that there is no troubling conflict of interests or disquieting appearance of impropriety&mdash;consent may justify an otherwise barred appointment.</p>
<p class="note-body">One potential disqualification issue is peculiar to the master's role. It may happen that a master who is an attorney represents a client whose litigation is assigned to the judge who appointed the attorney as master. Other parties to the litigation may fear that the attorney-master will gain special respect from the judge. A flat prohibition on appearance before the appointing judge during the time of service as master, however, might in some circumstances unduly limit the opportunity to make a desirable appointment. These matters may be regulated to some extent by state rules of professional responsibility. The question of present conflicts, and the possibility of future conflicts, can be considered at the time of appointment. Depending on the circumstances, the judge may consider it appropriate to impose a non-appearance condition on the lawyer-master, and perhaps on the master's firm as well.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The order appointing a pretrial master is vitally important in informing the master and the parties about the nature and extent of the master's duties and authority. Care must be taken to make the order as precise as possible. The parties must be given notice and opportunity to be heard on the question whether a master should be appointed and on the terms of the appointment. To the extent possible, the notice should describe the master's proposed duties, time to complete the duties, standards of review, and compensation. Often it will be useful to engage the parties in the process of identifying the master, inviting nominations, and reviewing potential candidates. Party involvement may be particularly useful if a pretrial master is expected to promote settlement.</p>
<p class="note-body">The hearing requirement of Rule 53(b)(1) can be satisfied by an opportunity to make written submissions unless the circumstances require live testimony.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 53(b)(2) requires precise designation of the master's duties and authority. Clear identification of any investigating or enforcement duties is particularly important. Clear delineation of topics for any reports or recommendations is also an important part of this process. And it is important to protect against delay by establishing a time schedule for performing the assigned duties. Early designation of the procedure for fixing the master's compensation also may provide useful guidance to the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">Ex parte communications between a master and the court present troubling questions. Ordinarily the order should prohibit such communications, assuring that the parties know where authority is lodged at each step of the proceedings. Prohibiting ex parte communications between master and court also can enhance the role of a settlement master by assuring the parties that settlement can be fostered by confidential revelations that will not be shared with the court. Yet there may be circumstances in which the master's role is enhanced by the opportunity for ex parte communications with the court. A master assigned to help coordinate multiple proceedings, for example, may benefit from off-the-record exchanges with the court about logistical matters. The rule does not directly regulate these matters. It requires only that the court exercise its discretion and address the topic in the order of appointment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similarly difficult questions surround ex parte communications between a master and the parties. Ex parte communications may be essential in seeking to advance settlement. Ex parte communications also may prove useful in other settings, as with in camera review of documents to resolve privilege questions. In most settings, however, ex parte communications with the parties should be discouraged or prohibited. The rule requires that the court address the topic in the order of appointment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2)(C) provides that the appointment order must state the nature of the materials to be preserved and filed as the record of the master's activities, and (b)(2)(D) requires that the order state the method of filing the record. It is not feasible to prescribe the nature of the record without regard to the nature of the master's duties. The records appropriate to discovery duties may be different from those appropriate to encouraging settlement, investigating possible violations of a complex decree, or making recommendations for trial findings. A basic requirement, however, is that the master must make and file a complete record of the evidence considered in making or recommending findings of fact on the basis of evidence. The order of appointment should routinely include this requirement unless the nature of the appointment precludes any prospect that the master will make or recommend evidence-based findings of fact. In some circumstances it may be appropriate for a party to file materials directly with the court as provided by Rule 5(e), but in many circumstances filing with the court may be inappropriate. Confidentiality is important with respect to many materials that may properly be considered by a master. Materials in the record can be transmitted to the court, and filed, in connection with review of a master's order, report, or recommendations under subdivisions (f) and (g). Independently of review proceedings, the court may direct filing of any materials that it wishes to make part of the public record.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in subdivision (b)(2)(D) that the order must state the standards for reviewing the master's orders, findings, or recommendations is a reminder of the provisions of subdivision (g)(3) that recognize stipulations for review less searching than the presumptive requirement of de novo decision by the court. Subdivision (b)(2)(D) does not authorize the court to supersede the limits of subdivision (g)(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">In setting the procedure for fixing the master's compensation, it is useful at the outset to establish specific guidelines to control total expense. The court has power under subdivision (h) to change the basis and terms for determining compensation after notice to the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) permits entry of the order appointing a master only after the master has filed an affidavit <!-- PDFPage:254 -->disclosing whether there is any ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. &sect;455. If the affidavit discloses a possible ground for disqualification, the order can enter only if the court determines that there is no ground for disqualification or if the parties, knowing of the ground for disqualification, consent with the court's approval to waive the disqualification.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in Rule 53(b)(4) for amending the order of appointment is as important as the provisions for the initial order. Anything that could be done in the initial order can be done by amendment. The hearing requirement can be satisfied by an opportunity to make written submissions unless the circumstances require live testimony.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Subdivision (c) is a simplification of the provisions scattered throughout present Rule 53. It is intended to provide the broad and flexible authority necessary to discharge the master's responsibilities. The most important delineation of a master's authority and duties is provided by the Rule 53(b) appointing order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The subdivision (d) provisions for evidentiary hearings are reduced from the extensive provisions in current Rule 53. This simplification of the rule is not intended to diminish the authority that may be delegated to a master. Reliance is placed on the broad and general terms of subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Subdivision (e) provides that a master's order must be filed and entered on the docket. It must be promptly served on the parties, a task ordinarily accomplished by mailing or other means as permitted by Rule 5(b). In some circumstances it may be appropriate to have the clerk's office assist the master in mailing the order to the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. Subdivision (f) restates some of the provisions of present Rule 53(e)(1). The report is the master's primary means of communication with the court. The materials to be provided to support review of the report will depend on the nature of the report. The master should provide all portions of the record preserved under Rule 53(b)(2)(C) that the master deems relevant to the report. The parties may designate additional materials from the record, and may seek permission to supplement the record with evidence. The court may direct that additional materials from the record be provided and filed. Given the wide array of tasks that may be assigned to a pretrial master, there may be circumstances that justify sealing a report or review record against public access&mdash;a report on continuing or failed settlement efforts is the most likely example. A post-trial master may be assigned duties in formulating a decree that deserve similar protection. Such circumstances may even justify denying access to the report or review materials by the parties, although this step should be taken only for the most compelling reasons. Sealing is much less likely to be appropriate with respect to a trial master's report.</p>
<p class="note-body">Before formally making an order, report, or recommendations, a master may find it helpful to circulate a draft to the parties for review and comment. The usefulness of this practice depends on the nature of the master's proposed action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. The provisions of subdivision (g)(1), describing the court's powers to afford a hearing, take evidence, and act on a master's order, report, or recommendations are drawn from present Rule 53(e)(2), but are not limited, as present Rule 53(e)(2) is limited, to the report of a trial master in a nonjury action. The requirement that the court must afford an opportunity to be heard can be satisfied by taking written submissions when the court acts on the report without taking live testimony.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision (g)(2) time limits for objecting to&mdash;or seeking adoption or modification of&mdash;a master's order, report, or recommendations, are important. They are not jurisdictional. Although a court may properly refuse to entertain untimely review proceedings, the court may excuse the failure to seek timely review. The basic time period is lengthened to 20 days because the present 10-day period may be too short to permit thorough study and response to a complex report dealing with complex litigation. If no party asks the court to act on a master's report, the court is free to adopt the master's action or to disregard it at any relevant point in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g)(3) establishes the standards of review for a master's findings of fact or recommended findings of fact. The court must decide de novo all objections to findings of fact made or recommended by the master unless the parties stipulate, with the court's consent, that the findings will be reviewed for clear error or&mdash;with respect to a master appointed on the parties&rsquo; consent or appointed to address pretrial or post-trial matters&mdash;that the findings will be final. Clear-error review is more likely to be appropriate with respect to findings that do not go to the merits of the underlying claims or defenses, such as findings of fact bearing on a privilege objection to a discovery request. Even if no objection is made, the court is free to decide the facts de novo; to review for clear error if an earlier approved stipulation provided clear-error review; or to withdraw its consent to a stipulation for clear-error review or finality, and then to decide de novo. If the court withdraws its consent to a stipulation for finality or clear-error review, it may reopen the opportunity to object.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under Rule 53(g)(4), the court must decide de novo all objections to conclusions of law made or recommended by a master. As with findings of fact, the court also may decide conclusions of law de novo when no objection is made.</p>
<p class="note-body">Apart from factual and legal questions, masters often make determinations that, when made by a trial court, would be treated as matters of procedural discretion. The court may set a standard for review of such matters in the order of appointment, and may amend the order to establish the standard. If no standard is set by the original or amended order appointing the master, review of procedural matters is for abuse of discretion. The subordinate role of the master means that the trial court's review for abuse of discretion may be more searching than the review that an appellate court makes of a trial court.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a master makes a recommendation on any matter that does not fall within Rule 53(g)(3), (4), or (5), the court may act on the recommendation under Rule 53(g)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em>. The need to pay compensation is a substantial reason for care in appointing private persons as masters.</p>
<p class="note-body">Payment of the master's fees must be allocated among the parties and any property or subject-matter within the court's control. The amount in controversy and the means of the parties may provide some guidance in making the allocation. The nature of the dispute also may be important&mdash;parties pursuing matters of public interest, for example, may deserve special protection. A party whose unreasonable behavior has occasioned the need to appoint a master, on the other hand, may properly be charged all or a major portion of the master's fees. It may be proper to revise an interim allocation after decision on the merits. The revision need not await a decision that is final for purposes of appeal, but may be made to reflect disposition of a substantial portion of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The basis and terms for fixing compensation should be stated in the order of appointment. The court retains power to alter the initial basis and terms, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, but should protect the parties against unfair surprise.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of former Rule 53(a) that the &ldquo;provision for compensation shall not apply when a United States Magistrate Judge is designated to serve as a master&rdquo; is deleted as unnecessary. Other provisions of law preclude compensation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)</em>. Rule 53(i) carries forward unchanged former Rule 53(f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. Subdivision (a)(3), barring appearance by a master as attorney before the appointing judge during the period of the appointment, is deleted. Subdivision (a)(4) is renumbered as (a)(3).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:255 --><p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is amended by adding new material to the subparagraph (A), (B,) (C), and (D) specifications of issues that must be addressed in the order appointing a master. (A) now requires a statement of any investigation or enforcement duties. (B) now establishes a presumption that ex parte communications between master and court are limited to administrative matters; the court may, in its discretion, permit ex parte communications on other matters. (C) directs that the order address not only preservation but also filing of the record. (D) requires that the order state the method of filing the record.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) is changed by requiring an opportunity to be heard on an order amending an appointment order. It also is renumbered as (b)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(4), renumbered as (b)(3), is redrafted to express the original meaning more clearly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) has a minor style change.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g)(1) is amended to state that in acting on a master's recommendations the court &ldquo;must&rdquo; afford an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g)(3) is changed to narrow still further the opportunities to depart from de novo determination of objections to a master's findings or recommendations for findings of fact.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g)(4) is changed by deleting the opportunity of the parties to stipulate that a master's conclusions of law will be final.</p>
