The pages shall be numbered consecutively, with a minimum of 25 lines per page. It is not necessary for the witnesses to sign the transcripts of their testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Exhibits.</strong> All exhibits offered by either of the parties shall bear the caption and number of the case, the exhibit numbers, in figures, whether for plaintiff or defendant unless the court provides for the offering parties to otherwise designate their exhibits, and the number of sheets in each exhibit. All exhibits admitted in evidence or designated to accompany the transcript shall accompany and be filed with the transcript of the testimony, but shall not be affixed thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Certificate of Reporter.</strong> The reporter shall append to the transcript of the testimony a certificate similar to Appendix of Forms (Forms 3A and 3B). The certificate shall be signed by the reporter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) index.</strong><sup><a href="#Rule_80.1_1_target" name="Rule_80.1_1">1</a></sup> At the beginning of each volume of the transcript of testimony, there shall be an index containing: (a) the names of the witnesses examined, citing the pages of the transcript where direct, cross, redirect, or recross-examination of the respective witnesses began; and (b) the exhibits in the case, first for the plaintiff and then for the defendant, with a brief statement of the nature of each of the exhibits and with references to the pages of the transcript where said respective exhibits were (1) offered and (2) received in evidence.

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 80.1 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule's principal text formerly appeared in these rules as Appendix A. The incorporation of former Appendix A into the main body of the rules reflects a more logical placement of its subject matter in the organizational structure of the court's rules. Additionally, as part of this rule's relocation, Forms A and B of former Appendix A (pertaining to reporter certifications) were assigned to the new Appendix of Forms. They appear there as Forms 3A and 3B.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes introduced in this rule include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) of the rule formerly appeared in these rules as paragraph (b)(1) of RCFC 39. The changes introduced in new subdivision (a) were deemed necessary in order to eliminate uncertainty as to the court's authority to furnish a reporter for trials scheduled outside of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) of the rule formerly appeared as paragraph (b)(2) of RCFC 39.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (i) of the rule formerly appeared as paragraph (b)(3) of RCFC 39. Additionally, subdivision (i) reflects the change in the court's name.</p>
