<h3 class="section-head">Rule 502. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure Made in a Federal Proceeding or to a Federal Office or Agency; Scope of a Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the disclosure is made in a Federal proceeding or to a Federal office or agency and waives the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed communication or information in a Federal or State proceeding only if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the waiver is intentional;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information concern the same subject matter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) they ought in fairness to be considered together.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inadvertent Disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When made in a Federal proceeding or to a Federal office or agency, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a Federal or State proceeding if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the disclosure is inadvertent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error, including (if applicable) following Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure Made in a State Proceeding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the disclosure is made in a State proceeding and is not the subject of a State-court order concerning waiver, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a Federal proceeding if the disclosure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been made in a Federal proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not a waiver under the law of the State where the disclosure occurred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Controlling Effect of a Court Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A Federal court may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court&mdash;in which event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other Federal or State proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An agreement on the effect of disclosure in a Federal proceeding is binding only on the parties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Controlling Effect of This Rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding Rules 101 and 1101, this rule applies to State proceedings and to Federal court-annexed and Federal court-mandated arbitration proceedings, in the circumstances set out in the rule. And notwithstanding Rule 501, this rule applies even if State law provides the rule of decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this rule:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;attorney-client privilege&rdquo; means the protection that applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client communications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;work-product protection&rdquo; means the protection that applicable law provides for tangible material (or its intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.</p>
