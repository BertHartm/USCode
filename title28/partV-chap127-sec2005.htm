<p class="statutory-body">Whenever State law requires that goods taken on execution be appraised before sale, goods taken under execution issued from a court of the United States shall be appraised in like manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States marshal shall summon the appraisers in the same manner as the sheriff is required to summon appraisers under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the appraisers fail to attend and perform their required duties, the marshal may sell the goods without an appraisal. Appraisers attending and performing their duties, shall receive the fees allowed for appraisals under State law.</p>

<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;shall be appraised in like manner&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;the appraisers appointed under the authority of the State may appraise goods taken in execution on a fieri facias issued out of any court of the United States&rdquo;. The change precludes construction that the State appraisers only are available to appraise such goods in civil actions in the federal courts.</p>
