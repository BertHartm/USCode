<p class="statutory-body">5. Since March 10, 1936, said book has been published by plaintiff and all copies of it made by plaintiff or under his authority or license have been printed, bound, and published in strict conformity with the provisions of the Act of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and all other laws governing copyright.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. Since March 10, 1936, plaintiff has been and still is the sole proprietor of all rights, title, and interest in and to the copyright in said book.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">7. After March 10, 1936, defendant infringed said copyright by publishing and placing upon the market a book entitled &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, which was copied largely from plaintiff's copyrighted book, entitled &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">8. A copy of plaintiff's copyrighted book is hereto attached as &ldquo;Exhibit 1&rdquo;; and a copy of defendant's infringing book is hereto attached as &ldquo;Exhibit 2.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) That defendant, his agents, and servants be enjoined during the pendency of this action and permanently from infringing said copyright of said plaintiff in any manner, and from publishing, selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of any copies of the book entitled &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) That defendant be required to pay to plaintiff such damages as plaintiff has sustained in consequence of defendant's infringement of said copyright and said unfair trade practices and unfair competition and to account for</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) all gains, profits and advantages derived by defendant by said trade practices and unfair competition and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) That defendant be required to deliver up to be &nbsp;impounded &nbsp;during &nbsp;the &nbsp;pendency &nbsp;of &nbsp;this action all copies of said book entitled &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; in his possession or under his control and to deliver up for destruction all infringing copies and all plates, molds, and other matter for making such infringing copies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) That defendant pay to plaintiff the costs of this action and reasonable attorney's fees to be allowed to the plaintiff by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) That plaintiff have such other and further relief as is just.</p>
