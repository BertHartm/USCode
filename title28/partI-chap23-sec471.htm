<!-- field-start:statute -->

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 102 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;650 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The problems of cost and delay in civil litigation in any United States district court must be addressed in the context of the full range of demands made on the district court's resources by both civil and criminal matters.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The courts, the litigants, the litigants&rsquo; attorneys, and the Congress and the executive branch, share responsibility for cost and delay in civil litigation and its impact on access to the courts, adjudication of cases on the merits, and the ability of the civil justice system to provide proper and timely judicial relief for aggrieved parties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The solutions to problems of cost and delay must include significant contributions by the courts, the litigants, the litigants&rsquo; attorneys, and by the Congress and the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In identifying, developing, and implementing solutions to problems of cost and delay in civil litigation, it is necessary to achieve a method of consultation so that individual judicial officers, litigants, and litigants&rsquo; attorneys who have developed techniques for litigation management and cost and delay reduction can effectively and promptly communicate those techniques to all participants in the civil justice system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Evidence suggests that an effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction program should incorporate several interrelated principles, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the differential treatment of cases that provides for individualized and specific management according to their needs, complexity, duration, and probable litigation careers;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) early involvement of a judicial officer in planning the progress of a case, controlling the discovery process, and scheduling hearings, trials, and other litigation events;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) regular communication between a judicial officer and attorneys during the pretrial process; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) utilization of alternative dispute resolution programs in appropriate cases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Because the increasing volume and complexity of civil and criminal cases imposes increasingly heavy workload burdens on judicial officers, clerks of court, and other court personnel, it is necessary to create an effective administrative structure to ensure ongoing consultation and communication regarding effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction principles and techniques.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Implementation of Plans</h4>
