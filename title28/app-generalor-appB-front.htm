<p class="note-body">Appendix B sets forth rules applicable to proceedings involving claims for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act [of 1986], 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;300aa&ndash;1 to &ndash;34 [33]. These rules originally became effective on January 25, 1989, and were revised on March 15, 1991, and May 1, 2002. The text of these rules as originally promulgated may be found at 16 Cl. Ct. XXI&ndash;LXI (1989) and, as initially revised, at 22 Cl. Ct. CXLVIII&ndash;CLX (1991).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Vaccine Rule 2(c)(1) has been amended to require that service upon the respondent be directed to the Director, Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, Office of Special Programs, Health Resources and Services Administration, in lieu of the Director, Bureau of Health Professionals.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Both stylistic and substantive changes have been made to the Vaccine Rules. The substantive changes are identified below.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Rule 2.</strong> Subdivision (b) previously listed the amount of the filing fee that was required to accompany a petition. The listing of the fee amount has been eliminated in favor of referring petitioners to the fee schedule posted on the court's website. This change is administrative only and is intended to permit future changes in fee amount to be implemented without the necessity for publication of a corresponding change in rule. Subdivision (c)(1) has been amended to show the current address for service upon respondent.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Rule 4.</strong> Subdivision (b), titled &ldquo;Early Status Conference,&rdquo; has been added to acknowledge the authority of a special master, exercisable at the special master's discretion, to convene an early status conference as an aid in the identification and scheduling of further proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Rule 10.</strong> The text of subdivision (a) has been amended to identify the alternative procedures a petitioner may elect to adopt&mdash;withdrawal of the petition or continuance of proceedings&mdash;following the special master's issuance of a notice under 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;12(g)(1) advising that a decision on the petition will not be entered within the prescribed statutory period (240 days, exclusive of periods of suspension and remand). Subdivision (a) further provides that in instances where the petitioner elects to withdraw the petition in lieu of continuing proceedings, the conclusion of proceedings will be identified by the special master's issuance of an order so indicating. Finally, the subdivision specifies that upon entry of the special master's order, such order shall be deemed a judgment for purposes of 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;15(e)(1). Subdivision (b), which dealt with vaccines administered prior to October 1, 1988, has been abrogated as being no longer necessary. Subdivision (c), titled &ldquo;Reconsideration,&rdquo; has been amended to indicate that where the special master elects to grant a motion for reconsideration, the special master shall not issue a superseding decision reaching a different result from the original decision without affording the non-moving party an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the motion for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Rule 13.</strong> This rule has been amended to recognize that the right to seek recovery of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;15(e) extends not only to cases in which a judgment has been entered but also to cases in which a petitioner exercises the statutory right to withdraw a petition following the issuance of an order concluding proceedings under Rule 10(a) or 29.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Rule 21.</strong> Under the Vaccine Act, the court enters judgment pursuant to a &ldquo;decision of the special master,&rdquo; i.e., a determination &ldquo;with respect to whether compensation is to be provided under the Program and the amount of such compensation.&rdquo; 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;12(d)(3)(A). A special master's decision, in other <!-- PDFPage:468 -->words, contemplates an adjudication. With this in mind, subdivision (a) of this rule has been amended to clarify that where a petition is voluntarily dismissed without order of the special master or the court (either by the filing of a notice of dismissal before service of respondent's report or pursuant to a stipulation of the parties) then, for administrative purposes, the conclusion of proceedings will be identified by an order of the special master rather than by a decision. Correspondingly, language has also been added to subdivisions (b) and (c) to clarify that an involuntary dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits with respect to which a judgment will be entered.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Rule 29.</strong> The opening sentence of this rule has been amended to identify the procedural requirement that applies in cases where a judge fails to direct entry of judgment within 420 days after the date of filing of the petition (&ldquo;the judge shall file the notice required by 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;12(g)(2)&rdquo;). Additionally, a final sentence has been added to clarify that where a petitioner elects to withdraw a petition following the receipt of the notice required by 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;12(g)(2), the conclusion of proceedings will be identified by the judge's issuance of an order rather than by a judgment. The same sentence further notes that upon entry, such order shall be deemed a judgment for purposes of 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;15(e)(1).</p>
