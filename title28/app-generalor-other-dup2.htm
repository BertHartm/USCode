<p class="note-body">RCFC 7.2 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 83.2 and, following the court's May 1, 2002, revision of its rules, as RCFC 7.1. The first renumbering of the rule (from RCFC 83.2 to RCFC 7.1) was intended to reflect its more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules; the second renumbering (from RCFC 7.1 to RCFC 7.2) accommodates the court's adoption of FRCP 7.1 effective December 1, 2002, and preserves the consistency in numbering systems between the court's rules and the FRCP.</p>

<!-- field-start:head -->
<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Claims for Relief.</strong> A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Defenses; Form of Denials.</strong> A party shall state in short and plain terms the party's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If a party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the party shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, the pleader shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, the pleader may make denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs or may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the pleader expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all its averments, including averments of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, the pleader may do so by general denial subject to the obligations set forth in RCFC 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Affirmative Defenses.</strong> In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estop<!-- PDFPage:413 -->pel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Failure to Deny.</strong> Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Pleading to Be Concise and Direct; Consistency.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or equitable grounds. All statements shall be made subject to the obligations set forth in RCFC 11.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Construction of Pleadings.</strong> All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes have been made in subdivisions (b) and (c) to conform to FRCP 8. In addition, subdivision (c) was amended to require the pleading, as an affirmative defense, of assumption of risk and contributory negligence. Although these defenses are typically associated with tort claims (i.e., with claims outside this court's jurisdiction), there can be circumstances in which reliance on these defenses would be appropriate, for example, in congressional reference cases, in some aspects of contract litigation, and with respect to counterclaims asserted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2508.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Capacity.</strong> It is not necessary to aver the capacity of a party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity or the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party, except to the extent required to show the jurisdiction of the court. When a party desires to raise an issue as to the legal existence of any party or the capacity of any party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, the party desiring to raise the issue shall do so by specific negative averment, which shall include such supporting particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader's knowledge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Fraud, Mistake, Condition of the Mind.</strong> In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Conditions Precedent.</strong> In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with particularity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Official Document or Act.</strong> In pleading an official document or official act it is sufficient to aver that the document was issued or the act done in compliance with law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Judgment.</strong> In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or of a board or officer, it is sufficient to aver the judgment or decision without setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Time and Place.</strong> For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of a pleading, averments of time and place are material and shall be considered like all other averments of material matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Special Damage.</strong> When items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Special Matters Required in Complaint.</strong> The complaint shall include:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Citations of Statutes, Regulations, Orders.</strong> A clear citation of the Act of Congress, regulation of an executive department or agency, or Executive Order of the President, where the claim is founded upon such an act, regulation, or order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Contracts or Treaties.</strong> If the claim is founded upon a contract or treaty with the United States, a description of the contract or treaty sufficient to identify it. In addition, the plaintiff shall plead the substance of those portions of the contract or treaty on which the plaintiff relies or shall annex to the complaint a copy of the contract or treaty, indicating the provisions thereof on which the plaintiff relies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Patent Suits.</strong> In any patent suit, the claim or claims of the patent or patents alleged to be infringed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Ownership of Claim; Assignment.</strong> If the plaintiff is the owner by assignment or other transfer of the claim, in whole or in part, when and upon what consideration the assignment or transfer was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Tax Refund Suits.</strong> In any action for refund of federal tax, for each tax year or period for which a refund is sought, the amount, date, and place of each payment to be refunded; the date and place the return, if any, was filed; the name, address, and identification number of the taxpayer or taxpayers appearing on the tax return; the date and place the claim for refund was filed; and the identification number for each plaintiff, if different from the identification number of the taxpayer. A copy of the claim for refund shall be annexed to the complaint.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:414 --><p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7) Inverse Condemnation Suits.</strong> In any action for the payment of just compensation pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, identification of the specific property interest that plaintiff contends has been taken by the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Paragraphs; Separate Statements.</strong> All averments of claim or defense shall be made in numbered paragraphs, the contents of each of which shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances; and a paragraph may be referred to by number in all succeeding pleadings. Each claim founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence and each defense other than denials shall be stated in a separate count or defense whenever a separation facilitates the clear presentation of the matters set forth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Adoption by Reference; Exhibits.</strong> Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or in another pleading or in any motion.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Signature.</strong> Every pleading, motion, and other paper shall be signed by or for the attorney of record in the signing attorney's own individual name, or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party. Each paper shall state the signer's address and telephone number, if any. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. An unsigned paper shall be stricken unless the omission is corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Representations to Court.</strong> By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support, or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence, or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Sanctions.</strong> If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, subject to the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) How Initiated.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A) By Motion.</strong> A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b). It shall be served as provided in RCFC 5, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other period as the court may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. If warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B) On Court's Initiative.</strong> On its own initiative, the court may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:415 --><p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Nature of Sanction; Limitations.</strong> A sanction imposed for violation of this rule shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the sanction may consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into court, or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party for a violation of subdivision (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's initiative unless the court issues its order to show cause before a voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Order.</strong> When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Inapplicability to Discovery.</strong> Subdivisions (a) through (c) of this rule do not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to the provisions of RCFC 26 through 37.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The United States shall file its answer to the complaint within 60 days after service of the pleading in which the claim is asserted. After service of an answer containing a counterclaim, offset, or plea of fraud, plaintiff shall have 20 days within which to file a reply to the counterclaim, offset, or plea of fraud. If a reply to an answer or a responsive pleading to a third-party complaint or answer is ordered by the court, the reply or responsive pleading shall be filed within 20 days after service of the order unless the order otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Unless a different time is fixed by court order, the service of a motion permitted under this rule or RCFC 56 alters these periods of time, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> if the court denies or partially denies or partially allows the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits or the motion is withdrawn, the responsive pleading shall be filed within 10 days after notice of the court's action or the date on which the motion is withdrawn or by the date the response otherwise would have been due, whichever is later;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading shall be filed within 10 days after the service of the more definite statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) How Presented.</strong> Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) [not used]; (4) insufficiency of process, (5) insufficiency of service of process, (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (7) failure to join a party under RCFC 19. A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in RCFC 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by RCFC 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.</strong> After the pleadings are closed, but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in RCFC 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by RCFC 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Preliminary Hearings.</strong> The defenses specifically enumerated in subdivision (b) of this rule, whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment mentioned in subdivision (c) of this rule shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Motion for More Definite Statement.</strong> If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after notice of the order or within such other time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Motion to Strike.</strong> Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days <!-- PDFPage:416 -->after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Consolidation of Defenses in Motion.</strong> A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h)(2) of this rule on any of the grounds there stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, or insufficiency of process, or insufficiency of service of process is waived (A) if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision (g), or (B) if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by RCFC 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a defense of failure to join a party indispensable under RCFC 19, and an objection of failure to state a legal defense to a claim may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under RCFC 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">To more closely parallel FRCP 12, subdivisions (b) and (h) of the court's rule have been enlarged by adding the defense of &ldquo;insufficiency of service of process&rdquo; and the defense of &ldquo;failure to join a party indispensable under RCFC 19.&rdquo; Further, as an aid to practitioners, most of whom are familiar with practice in the district courts, the enumeration of defenses in subdivision (b) has been brought into conformity with the corresponding subdivision of the FRCP. Finally, subdivision (i) (&ldquo;Suspension of Discovery&rdquo;) has been deleted. That subdivision is not part of the comparable FRCP, and its subject matter is more appropriately dealt with as a case management matter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Compulsory Counterclaims.</strong> The answer shall state as a counterclaim any claim which, at the time of serving the answer, the defendant has against any plaintiff, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the answer need not state the claim if at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Permissive Counterclaims.</strong> The answer may state as a counterclaim any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim.</strong> A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Counterclaim Against the United States.</strong> These rules shall not be construed to enlarge beyond the limits now fixed by law the right to assert counterclaims or to claim credits against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading.</strong> A claim which either matured or was acquired by the defendant after serving its pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Omitted Counterclaim.</strong> When the defendant fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, it may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Cross-Claim Against Co-Party.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Joinder of Additional Parties.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Separate Trials; Separate Judgments.</strong> If the court orders separate trials as provided in RCFC 42(b), judgment on a counterclaim may be rendered in accordance with the terms of RCFC 54(b) when the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party have been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) has been changed to add the language of FRCP 13(d) in recognition of the fact that there is no statutory bar to third-party defendants filing counterclaims against the United States. <em>See</em> 41 U.S.C. &sect;114 and RCFC 14. Other significant differences between this version and the FRCP have been preserved as necessary in light of the fact that the United States is the only defendant in this court.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Summoned Parties.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> On motion of the United States, the court may summon any third person against whom the United States may be asserting a claim or contingent claim for the recovery of money paid by the United States in respect of the transaction or matter that constitutes the subject matter of the suit to appear as a party and defend the third party's interest, if any, in such suit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The motion for a summons shall be accompanied by an appropriate pleading setting forth the claim or contingent claim that the United States is asserting against such third person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> If the court grants the motion of the United States, the clerk shall issue an original and one copy of such summons for each person to be summoned. The summons shall contain the names of the parties and a statement of the time within which the party summoned is required to appear and answer. The summons shall also state that the United States is asserting a claim against such person, as described in the accompanying pleading of the United States. The summons shall indicate that it is accompanied by a copy or copies of all pleadings filed in said action, naming such <!-- PDFPage:417 -->pleadings which shall be attached by the United States. Upon issuance of the summons, the clerk shall deliver the summons to the Attorney General for personal service, and the return of such service shall be made directly to the clerk.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Notice to Interested Parties.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The court, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, may notify any person with legal capacity to sue and be sued and who is alleged to have an interest in the subject matter of any pending action. Such notice shall advise of the pendency of the action and of the opportunity to seek intervention and to assert an interest in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A motion made by the plaintiff shall be filed at the time the complaint is filed. Copies and service of such motion shall be as provided in RCFC 4 and 5.3(d). A motion made by the United States shall be filed on or before the date on which the answer is required to be filed. For good cause shown, the court may allow any such motion to be filed at a later time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The motion for notice shall state the name and address of such person and set forth the interest that such person appears to have in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> If the court, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, orders any third person to be notified, the clerk shall issue an original and one copy of the notice for each third person to be notified. The notice shall contain the names of the parties and a statement of the time within which such third person may appear. The notice shall indicate that it is accompanied by a copy of the pleadings, which shall be attached by the moving party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> Upon the issuance of such notice upon motion of a party, the notice shall be delivered by the clerk to the moving party, who shall, at the moving party's expense, cause the same to be served on the person to be notified by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, with the moving party to file with the clerk the return of such service, which return shall include the copy of the notice with return receipt attached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> When the court directs the issuance of a notice to a third person on its own motion, each of the existing parties shall, on request of the clerk, deliver to the clerk a sufficient number of copies of the pleadings filed by such party to provide the third party to be notified with a copy of each of such pleadings, and the clerk shall forthwith issue such notice as specified in subdivision (b)(4) and forward the same with accompanying copies of the pleadings to the Attorney General for service as provided in subdivision (b)(5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> When service of the notice required by subdivision (b)(4) is to be effected upon a third person in a foreign country, service of the notice may be made by the moving party or the court, as required by subdivisions (b)(5) and (6), and proof of such service may be made in the manner authorized by FRCP 4(f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Pleadings of Third Parties.</strong> Within 42 days after service upon a third person of a summons or notice issued pursuant to this rule, such person may file an answer or a complaint setting forth the person's interest, if any, in the subject matter of the action and the nature of the person's claim against the United States, or both, which pleadings shall comply with the requirements of these rules with respect to the filing of original complaints and answers, except that only an original and 2 copies of a complaint are to be filed with proof of service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 14 has been substantially revised. The order of the rule has been changed to distinguish more clearly between the two types of actions it permits with respect to entities that are not yet parties to the suit. New subdivision (a) deals exclusively with summons to persons whom the United States seeks to join formally as third parties. The procedures for such summons are now gathered under that subdivision. The same has been done with respect to motions for notice to inform non-parties of the pendency of the action and the opportunity to join as parties. In addition, language in the old rule with respect to service of notice by publication, as well as the consequences of failing to appear in response to such notice, have been stricken. The law in this area is unsettled; hence, the possibility existed that the manner and method of notice prescribed by the rule might not be found constitutionally adequate in all potential situations.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is important to note that RCFC 14's notice requirements do not apply to the procedures for notifying potential intervenors in procurement protest cases filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1491(b). RCFC 14 implements the authority set forth in 41 U.S.C. &sect;114. For service of third-party complaints, see RCFC 5.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Amendments.</strong> A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within 10 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendments to Conform to the Evidence.</strong> When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice the party in maintaining the <!-- PDFPage:418 -->party's action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Relation Back of Amendments.</strong> An amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Supplemental Pleadings.</strong> Upon motion of a party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit the party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense. If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor.</p>

<p class="note-body">Significant changes were made to FRCP 15 in 1991; minor changes were made in 1993. Most notable is the listing of criteria for relation back of amendments in subdivision (c). RCFC 15 was conformed to the comparable FRCP, with two exceptions: first, the language in FRCP subdivision (c)(3), relating to the timing of an amendment changing the name of a party, was omitted as inapplicable; and second, language in subdivision (c) of the FRCP, relating to faulty service on federal officers, also was omitted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> to join other parties and to amend the pleadings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> to file motions; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The scheduling order also may include:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> a direction that the parties file any of the submissions set out in Appendix A &nbsp;14, 15, 16 or 17; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The order shall issue as soon as practicable but in any event within 14 days after any preliminary scheduling conference, or, if no preliminary scheduling conference is held, as soon as practicable after the Joint Preliminary Status Report is filed. A schedule shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Subjects for Consideration at Pretrial Conferences.</strong> At any conference under this rule, consideration may be given, and the court may take appropriate action, with respect to</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> the possibility of obtaining admissions of fact and of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof, stipulations regarding the authenticity of documents, and advance rulings from the court on the admissibility of evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> the avoidance of unnecessary proof and of cumulative evidence, and limitations or restrictions on the use of testimony under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> the appropriateness and timing of summary adjudications under RCFC 56 and 56.1;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">At least one of the attorneys for each party participating in any conference before trial shall have authority to enter into stipulations and to make admissions regarding all matters that the participants may reasonably anticipate may be discussed. If appropriate, the court may require that a party or its representative be present or reasonably available by telephone in order to consider possible settlement of the dispute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Final Pretrial Conference.</strong> Any final pretrial conference shall be held as close to the time of trial as reasonable under the circumstances. The participants at any such conference shall formulate a plan for trial, including the program for facilitating the admission of evidence. The conference shall be attended by at least one of the attorneys who will conduct the trial for each of the parties and by any unrepresented parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Pretrial Orders.</strong> After any conference held pursuant to this rule, an order shall be entered reciting the action taken. The order following a final pretrial conference shall be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Sanctions.</strong> If a party or party's attorney fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order, or if no appearance is made on behalf of a party at a scheduling or pretrial conference, or if a party or party's attorney is substantially unprepared to participate in the conference, or if a party or party's attorney fails to participate in good faith, the judge, upon motion or the judge's own initiative, may make such orders with regard thereto as are just, and among others any of the orders provided in RCFC 37(b)(2)(B), (C), (D). In lieu of or in addition to any other sanction, the judge shall require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, including attorney's fees, unless the judge finds that the noncompliance was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
