<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Real Party in Interest.</strong> Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, or a party authorized by statute may sue in that person's own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same ef<!-- PDFPage:368 -->fect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Capacity To Sue or Be Sued.</strong> The capacity of an individual, other than one acting in a representative capacity, to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the individual's domicile. The capacity of a corporation to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law under which it was organized. A partnership or other unincorporated association which has no capacity by law of its state may sue or be sued in its common name for the purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States. The capacity to sue or be sued of a representative appointed by a judicial tribunal shall be determined by the order of the judicial tribunal appointing or authorizing the representative and the law of the state or other authority under which the judicial tribunal exercises jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Infants or Incompetent Persons.</strong> Whenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on behalf of the infant or incompetent person. If an infant or incompetent person does not have a duly appointed representative the infant or incompetent may sue by the infant's or incompetent's next friend or by a guardian ad litem.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Joinder of Claims.</strong> A party asserting a claim to relief as an original claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, may join, either as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims as the party has against an opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Joinder of Remedies.</strong> Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 19. Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Persons To Be Joined If Feasible.</strong> Subject to, and in the manner provided for by Rule 14, a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if: (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties; or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the person's claimed interest. If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made an involuntary plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder Not Feasible.</strong> If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) of this rule cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: (1) to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; (2) the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measure, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; (4) whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder.</strong> A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall state the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) of this rule who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Exception of Class Actions.</strong> This rule is subject to provisions of Rule 23.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 20. Permissive Joinder of Parties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Permissive Joinder.</strong> All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will arise in the action. A plaintiff need not be interested in obtaining all the relief demanded. Where two or more plaintiffs demand separate judgments, the complaint shall state the judgment demanded by each plaintiff, shall list the plaintiffs alphabetically in the caption on the basis of surnames where individuals are involved, and shall assign to each plaintiff demanding a separate judgment a number to be used as a distinguishing subnumeral, <em>e.g</em>., (1), (2), etc., to the docket number of the case. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To add additional plaintiff(s) to a pending action, counsel for plaintiff(s) shall file a Notice of Additional Plaintiff(s), listing the plaintiff(s). The notice shall utilize the caption of the original complaint. The plaintiff(s) to be added shall be listed alphabetically in the notice and assigned a subnumeral that continues the subnumerals of the complaint or preceding amended complaint, so that the subnumerals are consecutive throughout.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The written consent of these individuals added to any pending action brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act shall accompany the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials.</strong> The court may make such orders as will prevent a party from being embarrassed, delayed, or put to expense, and may order separate trials or make other orders to prevent delay or prejudice.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Intervention of Right.</strong> Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: <strong>(1)</strong> when a statute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or <strong>(2)</strong> when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Permissive Intervention.</strong> Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: <strong>(1)</strong> when a statute of the United States confers a conditional right to intervene; or <strong>(2)</strong> when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Procedure.</strong> A person desiring to intervene shall file with the court a motion to intervene. The motion shall: <strong>(1)</strong> state the grounds therefor; <strong>(2)</strong> be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought; and <strong>(3)</strong> be served in accordance with Rule 5. The same procedure shall be followed when a statute of the United States gives a right to intervene.</p>

Service of the motion shall be made as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
