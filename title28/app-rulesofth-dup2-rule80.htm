<p class="statutory-body">(a) Custody and Control. All papers, exhibits and other material filed with or transmitted to the court shall be retained by the clerk of the court, under the clerk's custody and control except when required by the court. When requested by an attorney for a party, papers, exhibits and other material may be transmitted by the clerk to an appropriate customs officer.

Upon request of a party, the clerk may permit papers, exhibits and other material to be withdrawn to a designated place in the offices of the Attorney-in-Charge, International Trade Field Office, Commercial Litigation Branch, Department of Justice, for not more than 30 days, provided that they shall be returned immediately to the office of the clerk upon notice from the clerk.</p>

When a judgment or order of the court has become final, papers, exhibits, and other material transmitted to the court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2635, shall be returned by the clerk, together with a copy of the judgment or order, to the agency from which they were transmitted. All exhibits shall be removed from the custody of the clerk by the party who filed them within 60 days after the judgment or order of the court has become final.
