<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Appearance.</strong> Subject to the provisions of this rule, an eligible law student may enter an appearance in this court on behalf of any party provided the party on whose behalf the student appears has consented thereto in writing and a &ldquo;supervising attorney,&rdquo; as defined in this rule, has also indicated approval of that appearance in writing. In each case, the written consent and approval shall be filed with the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Activities.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Appearance on Briefs and Other Written Pleadings; Participation in Oral Argument and Other Activities.</strong> A law student who has entered an appearance in a case pursuant to subdivision (a) may:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> appear on the brief(s) and other written pleadings, provided the supervising attorney has read, approved, and co-signed the brief(s);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> participate in all proceedings ordered by a judge or special master provided the supervising attorney is present at such proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> engage in all other activities on behalf of the client in all ways that a licensed attorney may, subject to the general direction of the supervising attorney. However, a student may make no binding commitments on behalf of a client absent prior approval of both the client and the supervising attorney. In any matter in which testimony is taken, including depositions, the student must be accompanied by the supervising attorney. Documents or papers filed with the court must be read, approved, and co-signed by the supervising attorney.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Limitations on Activities.</strong> The court retains the authority to establish exceptions to the activities in paragraph (1), and also to limit a student's participation in any individual case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Eligibility.</strong> In order to be eligible to make an appearance pursuant to this rule, the law student must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> be a law student in good standing, enrolled in a law school approved by the American Bar Association;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> have completed legal studies amounting to at least two semesters, or the equivalent if the school is on some basis other than a semester basis;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> be enrolled for credit in a clinical program at an accredited law school that maintains malpractice insurance for its activities and conducts its activities under the direction of a faculty member of such law school;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> be certified by the dean of the law school as being of good character and sufficient legal ability, and as being adequately trained, in accordance with paragraphs (1)&ndash;(4) above, to fulfill the responsibilities of a legal intern to both the client and the court. Such certification must be filed with the clerk and may be withdrawn at any time by the dean upon written notice to the clerk;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> be certified by the chief judge to practice pursuant to this rule. This certification may be withdrawn at any time by the chief judge or, in a given case, by the judge or special master before whom the law student has entered an appearance, without notice of hearing and without any showing of cause; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> neither ask for nor receive any fee or compensation of any kind from the client on whose behalf service is rendered. However, this rule shall not prevent a lawyer, legal aid bureau, law school, or the government from paying compensation to the eligible law student, nor shall it prevent any of them from making such charges for its services as may otherwise be proper, nor shall it prevent any clinical program from receiving otherwise proper fees and expenses under RCFC 54(d)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> assist and counsel the student in activities allowed under this rule and review such activities with the student, all to the extent appropriate under the circumstances, for the proper practical training of the student and the protection of the client;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> assist the student in his or her preparation of the case to the extent the supervising attorney considers necessary and be available for consultation with represented clients;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> be present with the student in any proceedings before a judge or special master;</p>
