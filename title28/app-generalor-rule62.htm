The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Stay in Favor of the United States or Agency Thereof.</strong> When an appeal is taken by the United States or an officer or agency thereof or by direction of any department of the Government of the United States and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall be required from the appellant.</p>
