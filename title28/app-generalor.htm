<h3 class="analysis-subhead">RULES OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Court of Federal Claims (formerly designated United States Claims Court) was created by the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 (Pub. L. No. 97&ndash;164, 96 Stat. 25 (1982)). The court inherited the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the United States Court of Claims. Title 28 U.S.C. &sect;2503(b) authorizes the United States Court of Federal Claims to prescribe rules of practice and procedure for its proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to civil actions tried by a United States district court sitting without a jury have been incorporated into the following rules to the extent appropriate for proceedings in this court.</p>
<!-- field-end:analysis -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">In this 2002 revision, the court has endeavored to create a set of rules that conforms to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as amended through November 30, 2001, to the extent practicable given differences in jurisdiction between the United States district courts and the United States Court of Federal Claims. Consistent with this objective, interpretation of the court's rules will be guided by case law and the Advisory Committee Notes that accompany the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court's own Rules Committee Notes are intended primarily to state the source of a given rule but in some instances also provide interpretive guidance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Future revisions to these rules will be posted on the court's website at www.uscfc.uscourts.gov.</p>

At the same time, the clerk shall forward a copy of each such notice to the Attorney General.</p>

<p class="note-body">New RCFC 4.1 implements the contempt authority granted to this court by &sect;910 of the Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102&ndash;572, 106 Stat. 4506, 4519&ndash;20. That section, now codified at 28 U.S.C. &sect;2521(b), (c) (1994), reads in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(b) The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(1) misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(2) misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(3) disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree or command.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(c) The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have assistance in the carrying out of its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command as is available to a court of the United States. The United States marshal for any district in which the Court of Federal Claims is sitting shall, when requested by the chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims, attend any session of the Court of Federal Claims in such district.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule adopts the mode of service specified in FRCP 4.1, which requires that service of process, other than a summons, be effected upon non-parties through means more formal than mailing. <em>See generally</em> FRCP 4.1 Advisory Committee Notes (recognizing a distinction in service requirements between parties and non-parties); <em>I.A.M.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Service: When Required.</strong> Except as otherwise provided in these rules, every order required by its terms to be served, every pleading subsequent to the original complaint unless the court otherwise orders, every paper relating to discovery required to be served upon a party unless the court otherwise orders, every written motion, and every written notice, appearance, demand, offer of judgment, designation of record on appeal, and similar paper shall be served upon each of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Making Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Service under RCFC 5(a) and 77(d) on a party represented by an attorney is made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Service under RCFC 5(a) is made by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Delivering a copy to the person served by:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(i)</strong> handing it to the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ii)</strong> leaving it at the person's office with a clerk or other person in charge, or if no one is in charge leaving it in a conspicuous place in the office; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iii)</strong> if the person has no office or the office is closed, leaving it at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion residing there.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Mailing a copy to the last known address of the person served. Service by mail is complete on mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> If the person served has no known address, leaving a copy with the clerk of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> Delivering a copy by any other means, including electronic means, consented to in writing by the person served. Service by electronic means is complete on transmission; service by other consented means is complete when the person making service delivers the copy to the agency designated to make delivery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Service by electronic means under RCFC 5(b)(2)(D) is not effective if the party making service learns that the attempted service did not reach the person to be served.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Filing; Certificate of Service.</strong> All papers after the complaint required to be served upon a party, together with a certificate of service, must be filed with the court within a reasonable time after the service, but disclosures under RCFC 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: (i) depositions, (ii) interrogatories, (iii) requests for documents or to permit entry upon land, and (iv) requests for admission, except that depositions upon oral examination and notices thereof, written questions, interrogatories, requests for documents, requests for admission, and answers and responses thereto and other related discovery materials shall not be filed unless on order of the court. See RCFC 83.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Filing with the Court Defined.</strong> The filing of papers with the court as required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court, except that the judge may permit the papers to be filed with the judge, in which event the judge shall note thereon the filing date and forthwith transmit them to the office of the clerk. The court may by an amendment to these rules permit papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. A paper filed by electronic means in compliance with such amendment constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying these rules. The clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The changes made in RCFC 5 are intended to bring the rule into closer conformity with FRCP 5. Thus, in addition to a change in sequence, changes in text include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the text of subdivision (b) has been modified to reflect the December 1, 2001 changes to the FRCP which significantly affect organization and which also make possible consensual service by electronic means. In addition, the clause &ldquo;but filing is not&rdquo; has been deleted from the last sentence of that subdivision. The deleted language was not in conformity with the federal rule. <!-- PDFPage:404 -->Filing is not complete on mailing; filing is controlled by subdivisions (d) and (e) of this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, subdivision (e) adopts the language of the federal rule recognizing the appropriateness of permitting papers to be &ldquo;filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes.&rdquo; It should be noted that no decision has yet been made by the court to implement electronic filing. Such a decision, when made, will be accomplished through an amendment to the rules. Until the issuance of such amendment, the clerk's office will not accept electronic filings. Individual chambers, however, may allow counsel to transmit &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; copies of filed documents by electronic means.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, subdivision (e) also adds the final sentence from FRCP 5(e) stating that &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules.&rdquo; The addition of this language to the rule is not intended to alter the court's practice of treating all non-conforming complaints as filed upon receipt in the clerk's office, while referring other non-conforming papers received in the clerk's office to a judge for instructions as to whether to permit their filing or to require counsel's correction of the papers&rsquo; defects.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, former subdivision (e) titled, &ldquo;Proof of Service&rdquo; does not appear in FRCP 5. In order to conform more closely to FRCP 5, former subdivision (e) was deleted from this rule and now appears as RCFC 5.1.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Initial Brief or Memorandum.</strong> Except in briefs or memoranda of 10 pages or less or pretrial filings under Appendix A, the first brief or memorandum due shall contain, under proper headings and arranged in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> a table of contents, including the specific contents of any appendix or appendices to the brief or memorandum, listing the various items in the appendix, including the number and description of every item and exhibit which is being reproduced, together with the number of the page at which the item appears;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> a table of constitutional provisions, treaties, statutes, regulations, and cases cited, giving the volume and page in the official edition where they may be found, and arranging the cases in alphabetical order. All United States Claims Court and United States Court of Federal Claims orders and opinions published in either the United States Claims Court Reporter or the Federal Claims Reporter shall be cited to reporters;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> the argument, exhibiting clearly the points of fact and of law being presented, and citing the authorities relied upon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(F)</strong> a conclusion, indicating the relief sought; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(G)</strong> if an appendix is used, and is not incorporated into the same volume as the brief, there shall be, at the beginning of the appendix, a table of contents or index listing the various items in the appendix, including the number and description of every exhibit which is being reproduced, together with the number of the page of the appendix at which the item begins.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Opposing Brief or Memorandum.</strong> An opposing or answering brief or memorandum shall conform to the requirements set out in subdivision (a)(1), except that the items referred to in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of that subdivision need not be included unless the party is dissatisfied with the presentation by the other side.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Reply Brief or Memorandum.</strong> A reply brief or memorandum shall conform to the requirements of subdivision (a)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) General.</strong> Briefs or memoranda must be compact, concise, logically arranged, and free from burdensome, irrelevant, immaterial, and scandalous matter. Briefs or memoranda not complying with this rule may be disregarded by the court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Length of Briefs or Memoranda.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Except by leave of the court on motion, a party's initial brief or memorandum shall not exceed 40 pages (50 pages for a cross-movant) by any process of duplicating or copying, exclusive of (A) pages containing tables of contents, citations to constitutional provisions, treaties, statutes, regulations, and cases, and <!-- PDFPage:405 -->(B) any appendix setting out verbatim the pertinent portions of constitutional provisions, treaties, statutes, regulations, agency or board decisions, court decisions, excerpts from transcripts of testimony, and documentary exhibits.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5.3. Form, Size, and Duplication of all Papers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> All papers filed with the clerk shall conform with these rules as to methods of duplication, form, size, and number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Duplication.</strong> All requirements of duplication may be satisfied by the use of any photocopy method capable of producing a clear black image on white paper, provided that in each instance the duplication shall conform to the requirements of subdivision (c) as to paper, size, form, and pagination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Form and Size.</strong> All papers pursuant to the provisions of this rule shall be duplicated on pages not exceeding 81/2 by 11 inches, with type matter on all papers other than exhibits to be of letter quality. Type size for both text and footnotes shall not be smaller than 12 point and margins shall not be less than 1&rdquo; on all sides. Papers duplicated shall be double spaced, except that quoted and indented material and footnotes may be single spaced, and, if covering both sides of the sheet, shall be duplicated on paper of sufficient quality that the duplication process does not bleed through the sheet. Except for submissions of fewer than 50 pages, which may be stapled in the upper left-hand margin, all submissions must be bound or attached along the entire left margin in book form and shall have legible margins when bound or attached. Such pages need not be justified on the right margin. All pages, including appendices, shall be numbered. Page numbers shall be in large, distinct type and shall appear in the center of the bottom margin of the page.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Number of Copies.</strong> Plaintiff shall file an original and 7 copies of the complaint, the original of which shall be accompanied by the completed cover sheet as shown in the Appendix of Forms (Form 2) utilizing the Cover Sheet Information. Except as provided in RCFC 58.1, the parties shall file an original and 2 copies of each other paper required by these rules to be filed with the clerk. In congressional reference cases, an original and 4 copies of each such paper shall be filed. All copies shall be identical, or otherwise conformed, to the original.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Date.</strong> Each paper shall bear the date it is signed on the signature page.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Telephone and Facsimile Numbers.</strong> The telephone and facsimile numbers (including area code) of the attorney of record must appear beneath the signature line of every pleading or other paper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Name of Judge.</strong> In pleadings and papers other than the complaint, the name of the judge assigned to the case shall be included under the docket number.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">New RCFC 5.3 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 82 and 83. The consolidation and renumbering of RCFC 82 and 83 are intended to reflect their more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the renumbering, the text of former RCFC 82 has been modified in several respects: First, subdivision (a) has been modified by deleting the last sentence of that subdivision which read, &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall refuse to file any paper which is not in substantial conformity with this rule or not in clear type.&rdquo; The deletion corresponds to the change made in RCFC 5(e) directing that &ldquo;[t]he clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form.&rdquo; However, as noted in the Advisory Committee Note to FRCP 5(e), the &ldquo;clerk may of course advise a party or counsel that a particular instrument is not in proper form, and may be directed to so inform the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, subdivision (c) has been modified to eliminate certain redundancies; to fix the type size; and to clarify binding and pagination requirements. Appendices will be subject to pagination. The binding requirement changes are intended to discourage rubber bands, paper clips and other nonsecure binding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, former subdivision (e), now subdivision (f), has been amended to include a requirement listing a facsimile number for the attorney of record.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, subdivision (d) is an addition to the rule that incorporates the &ldquo;number of copies&rdquo; requirement that formerly appeared as RCFC 83, as well as the requirement formerly found in RCFC 3(c) regarding the number of copies to be filed when filing a complaint.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, subdivision (g) is also an added provision. The text of this subdivision formerly appeared as part of RCFC 10(a).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Claims for Relief.</strong> A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Defenses; Form of Denials.</strong> A party shall state in short and plain terms the party's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. If a party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the party shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a pleader intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, the pleader shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the preceding pleading, the pleader may make denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs, or may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the pleader expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all its averments, including averments of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, the pleader may do so by general denial subject to the obligations set forth in RCFC 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Affirmative Defenses.</strong> In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Failure to Deny.</strong> Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Pleading to be Concise and Direct; Consistency.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or equitable grounds. All statements shall be made subject to the obligations set forth in RCFC 11.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Construction of Pleadings.</strong> All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.</p>

<p class="note-body">Minor changes have been made in subdivisions (b) and (c) to conform this rule to FRCP 8. In addition, subdivision (c) was amended to require the pleading, as an affirmative defense, of assumption of risk and contributory negligence. Although these defenses are typically associated with tort claims (i.e., with claims outside of this court's jurisdiction), there can be circumstances in which reliance on these defenses would be appropriate, for example, in congressional reference cases, in some aspects of contract litigation, and with respect to counterclaims asserted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2508.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Capacity.</strong> It is not necessary to aver the capacity of a party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity or the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party, except to the extent required to show the jurisdiction of the court. When a party desires to raise an issue as to the legal existence of any party or the capacity of any party to sue or be sued or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, the party desiring to raise the issue shall do so by specific <!-- PDFPage:408 -->negative averment, which shall include such supporting particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader's knowledge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Time and Place.</strong> For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of a pleading, averments of time and place are material and shall be considered like all other averments of material matter.</p>

In addition, the plaintiff shall plead the substance of those portions of the contract or treaty on which the plaintiff relies, or shall annex to the complaint a copy of the contract or treaty, indicating the provisions thereof on which the plaintiff relies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Patent Suits.</strong> In any patent suit, the claim or claims of the patent or patents alleged to be infringed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Ownership of Claim; Assignment.</strong> If the plaintiff is the owner by assignment or other transfer of the claim, in whole or in part, when and upon what consideration the assignment or transfer was made.</p>

A copy of the claim for refund shall be annexed to the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7) Inverse Condemnation Suits.</strong> In any action for the payment of just compensation pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, identification of the specific property interest which plaintiff contends has been taken by the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 11. Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to Court; Sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Signature.</strong> Every pleading, motion, and other paper shall be signed by or for the attor<!-- PDFPage:409 -->ney of record in the signing attorney's own individual name, or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party. Each paper shall state the signer's address and telephone number, if any. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. An unsigned paper shall be stricken unless the omission is corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Representations to Court.</strong> By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Sanctions.</strong> If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, subject to the conditions stated below, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) How Initiated.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A) By Motion.</strong> A motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b). It shall be served as provided in RCFC 5, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days after service of the motion (or such other period as the court may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. If warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B) On Court's Initiative.</strong> On its own initiative, the court may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision (b) and directing an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision (b) with respect thereto.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Nature of Sanction; Limitations.</strong> A sanction imposed for violation of this rule shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the sanction may consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into court, or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party for a violation of subdivision (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court's initiative unless the court issues its order to show cause before a voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Order.</strong> When imposing sanctions, the court shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Inapplicability to Discovery.</strong> Subdivisions (a) through (c) of this rule do not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to the provisions of RCFC 26 through 37.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 12. Defenses and Objections&mdash;When and How Presented&mdash;By Pleading or Motion&mdash;Motion for Judgment on Pleadings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Presented.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The United States shall file its answer to the complaint within 60 days after service of the pleading in which the claim is asserted. After service of an answer containing a counterclaim, offset, or plea of fraud, plaintiff shall have 20 days within which to file a reply to the counterclaim, offset, or plea of fraud. If a reply to an answer or a responsive pleading to a third-party complaint or answer is ordered by the court, the reply or responsive pleading shall be filed within 20 days after service of the order unless the order otherwise directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Unless a different time is fixed by court order, the service of a motion permitted under this rule or RCFC 56 alters these periods of time, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> if the court denies or partially denies or partially allows the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits or the motion is withdrawn, the responsive pleading shall be filed within 10 days after notice of the court's action, or the date on which the motion is withdrawn, or by the date the response otherwise would have been due, whichever is later;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:410 --><p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading shall be filed within 10 days after the service of the more definite statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) How Presented.</strong> Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) [not used]; (4) insufficiency of process, (5) insufficiency of service of process, (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (7) failure to join a party under RCFC 19. A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, the adverse party may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in RCFC 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by RCFC 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.</strong> After the pleadings are closed, but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in RCFC 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by RCFC 56.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Preliminary Hearings.</strong> The defenses specifically enumerated in subdivision (b) of this rule, whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment mentioned in subdivision (c) of this rule shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Motion for More Definite Statement.</strong> If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after notice of the order or within such other time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Motion to Strike.</strong> Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Consolidation of Defenses in Motion.</strong> A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and then available to the party. If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in subdivision (h)(2) of this rule on any of the grounds there stated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person; or insufficiency of process, or insufficiency of service of process is waived (A) if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in subdivision (g), or (B) if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by RCFC 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a defense of failure to join a party indispensable under RCFC 19, and an objection of failure to state a legal defense to a claim, may be made in any pleading permitted or ordered under RCFC 7(a), or by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">To more closely parallel FRCP 12, subdivisions (b) and (h) of the court's rule are enlarged by adding the defense of &ldquo;insufficiency of service of process&rdquo; and the defense of &ldquo;failure to join a party indispensable under Rule 19.&rdquo; Further, as an aid to practitioners, most of whom are familiar with practice in the district courts, the enumeration of defenses in subdivision (b) has been brought into conformity with the corresponding subdivision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Finally, subdivision (i) (&ldquo;Suspension of Discovery&rdquo;) is deleted. That subdivision is not part of the comparable federal rule, and its subject matter is more appropriately dealt with as a case management matter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Compulsory Counterclaims.</strong> The answer shall state as a counterclaim any claim which, at the time of serving the answer, the defendant has against any plaintiff, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the answer need not state the claim if at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Permissive Counterclaims.</strong> The answer may state as a counterclaim any claim against an op<!-- PDFPage:411 -->posing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim.</strong> A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Counterclaim Against the United States.</strong> These rules shall not be construed to enlarge beyond the limits now fixed by law the right to assert counterclaims or to claim credits against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading.</strong> A claim which either matured or was acquired by the defendant after serving its pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Omitted Counterclaim.</strong> When the defendant fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, it may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Cross-Claim Against Co-Party.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Joinder of Additional Parties.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Separate Trials; Separate Judgments.</strong> If the court orders separate trials as provided in RCFC 42(b), judgment on a counterclaim may be rendered in accordance with the terms of RCFC 54(b) when the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party have been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Notice to Interested Parties.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The court, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, may notify any person with legal capacity to sue and be sued and who is alleged to have an interest in the subject matter of any pending action.

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 14 was substantially revised. The order of the rule has been changed to distinguish more clearly between the two types of actions it permits with respect to entities that are not yet parties to the suit. New subdivision (a) deals exclusively with summons to persons whom the United States seeks to join formally as third parties. The procedures for such summons are now gathered under that subdivision. The same has been done with respect to motions for notice to inform non-parties of the pendency of the action and the opportunity to join as parties. In addition, language in the old rule with respect to service of notice by publication, as well as the consequences of failing to appear in response to such notice, have been stricken. The law in this area is unsettled; hence the possibility existed that the manner and method of notice prescribed by the rule might not be found constitutionally adequate in all potential situations.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is important to note that RCFC 14 notice requirements do not apply to the procedures for notifying potential intervenors in procurement protest cases filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1491(b). RCFC 14 implements the authority set forth in 41 U.S.C. &sect;114. For service of third-party complaints see RCFC 5.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Amendments.</strong> A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within 10 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendments to Conform to the Evidence.</strong> When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice the party in maintaining the party's action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Relation Back of Amendments.</strong> An amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> relation back is permitted by the law that provides the statute of limitations applicable to the action, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision (2) is satisfied and the party to be brought in by amendment (A) has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (B) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Supplemental Pleadings.</strong> Upon motion of a party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, permit the party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense. If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Significant changes were made to FRCP 15 in 1991; minor changes were made in 1993. Most notable is the listing of criteria for relation back of amendments in subdivision (c). RCFC 15 was conformed to the comparable federal rule, with two exceptions:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the language in FRCP subdivision (c)(3), relating to the timing of an amendment changing the name of a party, was omitted as inapplicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, language in subdivision (c) of the federal rule, relating to faulty service on federal officers, also was omitted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> a direction that the parties file any of the submissions set out in Appendix A &nbsp;14, 15, 16 or 17; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Subjects for Consideration at Pretrial Conferences.</strong> At any conference under this rule consideration may be given, and the court may take appropriate action, with respect to</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> the possibility of obtaining admissions of fact and of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof, stipulations regarding the authenticity of documents, and advance rulings from the court on the admissibility of evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> the avoidance of unnecessary proof and of cumulative evidence, and limitations or restrictions on the use of testimony under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(14)</strong> an order directing a party to present evidence early in the trial with respect to a manageable issue that could, on the evidence, be the basis for a judgment as a matter of law or a judgment on partial findings under RCFC 52(c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Final Pretrial Conference.</strong> Any final pretrial conference shall be held as close to the time of trial as reasonable under the circumstances.

In lieu of or in addition to any other sanction, the judge shall require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, unless the judge finds that the noncompliance was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Real Party in Interest.</strong> Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, or a party authorized by statute may sue in that person's own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Capacity to Sue or be Sued.</strong> The capacity of an individual, other than one acting in a representative capacity, to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the individual's domicile. The capacity of a corporation to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law under which it was organized. In all other cases capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the applicable state, except (1) that a partnership or other unincorporated association which has no capacity by the law of its state may sue or be sued in its common name for the purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and (2) that the capacity of a receiver appointed by a court of the United States to sue or be sued in a court of the United States is governed by Title 28, U.S.C., Sections 754 and 959(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Infants or Incompetent Persons.</strong> Whenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on behalf of the infant or incompetent person. An infant or incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 17 was modified in minor respects in order to achieve closer conformity with FRCP 17. A difference between the court's rule and the corresponding federal rule occurs in subdivision (b). Subdivision (b) of the federal rule, subtitled &ldquo;Capacity to Sue or be Sued,&rdquo; provides generally that, in those cases for which no rule of decision is provided, &ldquo;capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the state in which the district court is held.&rdquo; In recognition of this court's nationwide jurisdiction, the quoted language was rewritten by substituting &ldquo;by the law of the applicable state&rdquo; for &ldquo;by the law of the state in which the district court is held.&rdquo;</p>

A third party may join, to the extent permitted by law, as many claims as the party has against the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Joinder of Remedies.</strong> Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Persons to be Joined if Feasible.</strong> A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made an involuntary plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder not Feasible.</strong> If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Permissive Joinder.</strong> All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will arise in the action. A plaintiff need not be interested in obtaining all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials.</strong> The court may make such orders as will prevent a party from being embarrassed, delayed, or put to expense by the inclusion of a party against whom the party asserts no claim and who asserts no claim against the party, and may order separate trials or make other orders to prevent delay or prejudice.</p>

<p class="note-body">The interpleader practice permitted under FRCP 22 is, for the most part, incompatible with the jurisdiction exercisable by this court. However, in those cases where the United States is in the position of a stakeholder facing the risks of double liability, RCFC 14 provides the means for summoning a third party.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 23. Class Actions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action.</strong> One or more members of a class may sue as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Class Actions Maintainable.</strong> An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> the United States has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. Matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by members of the class; and (C) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Determination by Order Whether Class Action to be Maintained; Notice; Judgment; Actions Conducted Partially as Class Actions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained. An order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> In any class action maintained, the court shall direct to the potential members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including notice to all individuals who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice shall advise that (A) the court will include the individual in the class action if the individual so requests by a specified date; and (B) the judgment(s), whether favorable or not, will bind the member(s) of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under subdivisions (b)(1) or (b)(2), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and specify or describe those to whom the notice provided in subdivision (c)(2) was directed, and who have requested inclusion, and whom the court finds to be members of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> When appropriate, (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Orders in Conduct of Actions.</strong> In the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the <!-- PDFPage:416 -->court may make appropriate orders: (1) determining the course of proceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument; (2) requiring, for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct to some or all of the members of any step in the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come into the action; (3) imposing conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors; (4) requiring that the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent persons, and that the action proceed accordingly; (5) dealing with similar procedural matters. The orders may be combined with an order under RCFC 16, and may be altered or amended as may be desirable from time to time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Dismissal or Compromise.</strong> A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Appeals.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 23 was completely rewritten. Although the court's rule is modeled largely on the comparable federal rule, there are significant differences between the two rules. In the main, the court's rule adopts the criteria for certifying and maintaining a class action as set forth in <em>Quinault Allottee Ass'n v. United States</em>, 197 Ct. Cl. 134, 453 F.2d 1272 (1972).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the relief available in this court is generally confined to individual money claims against the United States, the situations justifying the use of a class action are correspondingly narrower than those addressed in FRCP 23. Thus, the court's rule does not accommodate, <em>inter alia</em>, the factual situations redressable through declaratory and injunctive relief contemplated under FRCP (b)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Additionally, unlike the federal rule, the court's rule contemplates only opt-in class certifications, not opt-out classes. The latter were viewed as inappropriate here because of the need for specificity in money judgments against the United States, and the fact that the court's injunctive powers&mdash;the typical focus of an opt-out class&mdash;are more limited than those of a district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the court's rule does not contain a provision comparable to FRCP 23(f). That subdivision, which provides that a &ldquo;court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. granting or denying class certification&rdquo; has its origin in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(e), which authorizes the Supreme Court to promulgate rules that provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision other than those set out in Section 1292. Because no comparable statutory authority exists for this court's promulgation of a similar rule, subdivision (f) was omitted. It should be noted, however, that the Court of Federal Claims may certify questions to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1292(b) and 1295.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In a derivative action brought by one or more shareholders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association, the corporation or association having failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it, the complaint shall be verified and shall allege (1) that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains or that the plaintiff's share or membership thereafter devolved on the plaintiff by operation of law, and (2) that the action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on this court which it would not otherwise have. The complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for the plaintiff's failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association. The action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to shareholders or members in such manner as the court directs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Intervention of Right.</strong> Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Permissive Intervention.</strong> Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Procedure.</strong> A person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion to intervene upon the parties as provided in RCFC 5. The motion shall state the grounds therefor and shall be accom<!-- PDFPage:417 -->panied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Required Disclosures; Methods to Discover Additional Matter.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Initial Disclosures.</strong> Except in categories of proceedings specified in RCFC 26(a)(1)(E), or to the extent otherwise stipulated or directed by order, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to other parties:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment, identifying the subjects of the information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> a copy of, or a description by category and location of, all documents, data compilations, and tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party and that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> a computation of any category of damages claimed by the disclosing party, making available for inspection and copying as under RCFC 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, not privileged or protected from disclosure, on which such computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> The following categories of proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure under RCFC 26(a)(1):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(i)</strong> an action for review on an administrative record, including procurement protest and military pay cases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ii)</strong> [Not used.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iii)</strong> an action brought without counsel by a person in custody of the United States, a state, or a state subdivision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iv, v, vi and vii)</strong> [Not used.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(viii)</strong> an action to enforce an arbitration award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ix)</strong> an action under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">These disclosures must be made within 14 days after the filing of the Joint Preliminary Status Report (see Appendix A &nbsp;4) unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during the Early Meeting of Counsel (see Appendix A &nbsp;3) that initial disclosures are not appropriate in the circumstances of the action and states the objection in the Joint Preliminary Status Report. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures&mdash;if any&mdash;are to be made, and set the time for disclosure. Any party first served or otherwise joined after the Joint Preliminary Status Report must make these disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order. A party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it and is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully completed its investigation of the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Disclosure of Expert Testimony.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> In addition to the disclosures required by paragraph (1), a party shall disclose to other parties the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present evidence under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Except as otherwise stipulated or directed by the court, this disclosure shall, with respect to a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony, be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the wit<!-- PDFPage:418 -->ness. The report shall contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor; the data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions; any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions; the qualifications of the witness, including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the preceding ten years; the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony; and a listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within the preceding four years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> These disclosures shall be made at the times and in the sequence directed by the court. In the absence of other directions from the court or stipulation by the parties, see Appendix A &nbsp;5, 8, the disclosures shall be made at least 70 days before the scheduled close of discovery or, if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under paragraph (2)(B), within 30 days after the disclosure made by the other party. The parties shall supplement these disclosures when required under subdivision (e)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Pretrial Disclosures.</strong> [Not used. See Appendix A &nbsp;13, 15, 16.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Form of Disclosures.</strong> Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under RCFC 26(a)(1) through (3) must be made in writing, signed, and served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Methods to Discover Additional Matter.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property under RCFC 34 or 45(a)(1)(C), for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discovery Scope and Limits.</strong> Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) In General.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. All discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by RCFC 26(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Limitations.</strong> By order, the court may alter the limits in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or the length of depositions under RCFC 30. By order, the court may also limit the number of requests under RCFC 36. The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties&rsquo; resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues. The court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion under RCFC 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Trial Preparation: Materials.</strong> Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)(4), a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party. Upon request, a person not a party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that person. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement previously made is (A) a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or (B) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Trial Preparation: Experts.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. If a report from the expert is required under subdivision (a)(2)(B), the deposition shall not be conducted until after the report is provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> A party may, through interrogatories or by deposition, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or prepa<!-- PDFPage:419 -->ration for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial only as provided in RCFC 35(b) or upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> Unless manifest injustice would result, (i) the court shall require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to the discovery under this subdivision; and (ii) with respect to discovery obtained under subdivision (b)(4)(B) of this rule the court shall require the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Claims of Privilege or Protection of Trial Preparation Materials.</strong> When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable under these rules by claiming that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation material, the party shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protective Orders.</strong> Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, accompanied by a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> that the disclosure or discovery not be had;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> that the disclosure or discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to certain matters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> that discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> that a deposition, after being sealed, be opened only by order of the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a designated way; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(8)</strong> that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or other person provide or permit discovery. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Timing and Sequence of Discovery.</strong> Except in categories of proceedings exempted from initial disclosure under RCFC 26(a)(1)(E), or when authorized under these rules or by order or agreement of the parties, a party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Appendix A &nbsp;3. Unless the court upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any sequence, and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, does not operate to delay any other party's discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Supplementation of Disclosures and Responses.</strong> A party who has made a disclosure under subdivision (a) or responded to a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party is under a duty to supplement at appropriate intervals its disclosures under subdivision (a) if the party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing. With respect to testimony of an expert from whom a report is required under subdivision (a)(2)(B) the duty extends both to information contained in the report and to information provided through a deposition of the expert.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Conference of Parties; Planning for Discovery.</strong> [Not used. See Appendix A &nbsp;3.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Signing of Disclosures, Discovery Requests, Responses, and Objections.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Every disclosure made pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) or Appendix A &nbsp;13, 15, and 16 shall be signed by the attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. An unrepresented party shall sign the disclosure and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the disclosure is complete and correct as of the time it is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Every discovery request, response, or objection made by a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by the attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. An unrepresented party shall sign the request, response, or objection and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that to the best of <!-- PDFPage:420 -->the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, response, or objection is:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> If without substantial justification a certification is made in violation of the rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose behalf the disclosure, request, response, or objection is made, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 26 has been revised to parallel the structure and content of its counterpart in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The limited number of changes to the current federal rule, as amended in 2000, reflect those deemed necessary to accommodate the nature and jurisdiction of this court. Except for these changes, the rule shown conforms fully to the text of FRCP 26. Because the Appendix A Early Meeting of Counsel substantially accomplishes the same purpose as the FRCP 26(f) conference of counsel, the timing of initial disclosures was keyed to the former. Consequently, in lieu of the language of FRCP 26(f), cross reference is made to Appendix A &nbsp;3.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 27. Depositions Before Action or Pending Appeal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Before Action.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Petition.</strong> A person who desires to perpetuate testimony regarding any matter that may be cognizable in the court may file a verified petition. The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and shall show: 1, that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action cognizable in the court but is presently unable to bring it or cause it to be brought, 2, the subject matter of the expected action and the petitioner's interest therein, 3, the facts which the petitioner desires to establish by the proposed testimony and the reasons for desiring to perpetuate it, 4, [Not used.], and 5, the names and addresses of the persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the petitioner expects to elicit from each, and shall ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to take the depositions of the persons to be examined named in the petition, for the purpose of perpetuating their testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Notice and Service.</strong> The petition shall be served upon the United States in the same manner as a complaint. See RCFC 4. The petitioner may thereafter, by motion served upon counsel for the United States (see RCFC 5), request a hearing or the court may, <em>sua sponte</em>, by order, set a hearing on the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Order and Examination.</strong> If the court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, it shall make an order designating or describing the persons whose depositions may be taken and specifying the subject matter of the examination and whether the depositions shall be taken upon oral examination or written interrogatories. The depositions may then be taken in accordance with these rules; and the court may make orders of the character provided for by RCFC 34 and 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Use of Deposition.</strong> If a deposition to perpetuate testimony is taken under these rules, it may be used in any action involving the same subject matter subsequently brought in this court, in accordance with the provisions of RCFC 32(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pending Appeal.</strong> If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of the court or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the court may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in this court. In such case the party who desires to perpetuate the testimony may make a motion for leave to take the depositions, upon the same notice and service thereof as if the action was pending in this court. The motion shall show (1) the names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which the party expects to elicit from each; (2) the reasons for perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by RCFC 34 and 35, and thereupon the depositions may be taken and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in these rules for depositions taken in actions pending in this court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 28. Persons Before Whom Depositions may be Taken</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Within the United States.</strong> Within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held, or before a person appointed by the court. A person so appointed has power to administer oaths and take testimony. The term officer as used in RCFC 30, 31 and 32 includes a person appointed by the court or designated by the parties under RCFC 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) In Foreign Countries.</strong> Depositions may be taken in a foreign country (1) pursuant to any applicable treaty or convention, or (2) pursuant to a letter of request (whether or not captioned a letter rogatory), or (3) on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place where the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the United States, or (4) before a person commissioned by the court, and a person so commissioned shall have the power by virtue of the commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony. A commission or a letter of request shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission or a letter of request that the taking of the deposition in any other manner is impracticable or inconvenient; and both a commission and a letter of request may be issued in proper cases. A notice or commission may designate the person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive title. A letter of request may be addressed &ldquo;To the Appropriate Authority in [here name the country].&rdquo; When a letter of request or any other device is used pursuant to any applicable treaty or convention, it shall be captioned in the form prescribed by that treaty or convention. Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States under these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Disqualification for Interest.</strong> No deposition shall be taken before a person who is a relative or employee or attorney or counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of such attorney or counsel, or is financially interested in the action.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Depositions May Be Taken; When Leave Required.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon oral examination without leave of court except as provided in paragraph (2). The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by subpoena as provided in RCFC 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party must obtain leave of court, which shall be granted to the extent consistent with the principles stated in RCFC 26(b)(2), if the person to be examined is confined in prison or if, without the written stipulation of the parties,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> a proposed deposition would result in more than ten depositions being taken under this rule or RCFC 31 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by third-party defendants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the person to be examined already has been deposed in the case; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> a party seeks to take a deposition before the time specified in RCFC 26(d) unless the notice contains a certification, with supporting facts, that the person to be examined is expected to leave the United States and be unavailable for examination in this country unless deposed before that time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Notice of Examination: General Requirements; Method of Recording; Production of Documents and Things; Deposition of Organization; Deposition by Telephone.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination shall give reasonable notice in writing to every other party to the action. The notice shall state the time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the designation of the materials to be produced as set forth in the subpoena shall be attached to, or included in, the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The party taking the deposition shall state in the notice the method by which the testimony shall be recorded. Unless the court orders otherwise, it may be recorded by sound, sound-and-visual, or stenographic means, and the party taking the deposition shall bear the cost of the recording. Any party may arrange for a transcription to be made from the recording of a deposition taken by non-stenographic means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate an<!-- PDFPage:422 -->other method to record the deponent's testimony in addition to the method specified by the person taking the deposition. The additional record or transcript shall be made at that party's expense unless the court otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a deposition shall be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under RCFC 28 and shall begin with a statement on the record by the officer that includes (A) the officer's name and business address; (B) the date, time, and place of the deposition; (C) the name of the deponent; (D) the administration of the oath or affirmation to the deponent; and (E) an identification of all persons present. If the deposition is recorded other than stenographically, the officer shall repeat items (A) through (C) at the beginning of each unit of recorded tape or other recording medium. The appearance or demeanor of deponents or attorneys shall not be distorted through camera or sound-recording techniques. At the end of the deposition, the officer shall state on the record that the deposition is complete and shall set forth any stipulations made by counsel concerning the custody of the transcript or recording and the exhibits, or concerning other pertinent matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request made in compliance with RCFC 34 for the production of documents and tangible things at the taking of the deposition. The procedure of RCFC 34 shall apply to the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> A party may in the party's notice and in a subpoena name as the deponent a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency and describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In that event, the organization so named shall designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated, the matters on which the person will testify. A subpoena shall advise a non-party organization of its duty to make such a designation. The persons so designated shall testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the organization. This subdivision (b)(6) does not preclude taking a deposition by any other procedure authorized in these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> The parties may stipulate in writing or the court may upon motion order that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote electronic means. For the purposes of this rule and RCFC 28(a), a deposition taken by such means is taken at the place where the deponent is to answer questions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Examination and Cross-Examination; Record of Examination; Oath; Objections.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted at the trial under the provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence except Rules 103 and 615. The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall personally, or by someone acting under the officer's direction and in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically or recorded by any other method authorized by subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, to the manner of taking it, to the evidence presented, to the conduct of any party, or to any other aspect of the proceedings shall be noted by the officer upon the record of the deposition; but the examination shall proceed, with the testimony being taken subject to the objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition and the party taking the deposition shall transmit them to the officer, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Schedule and Duration; Motion to Terminate or Limit Examination.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any objection during a deposition must be stated concisely and in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation directed by the court, or to present a motion under RCFC 30(d)(4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Unless otherwise authorized by the court or stipulated by the parties, a deposition is limited to one day of seven hours. The court must allow additional time consistent with RCFC 26(b)(2) if needed for a fair examination of the deponent or if the deponent or another person, or other circumstance, impedes or delays the examination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> If the court finds that any impediment, delay, or other conduct has frustrated the fair examination of the deponent, it may impose upon the persons responsible an appropriate sanction, including the reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred by any parties as a result thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> At any time during the deposition, on motion of a party or of the deponent and upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, the court may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the deposition as provided in RCFC 26(c). If the order made terminates the examination, it may be resumed thereafter only upon the order of the court. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for an order. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Review by Witness; Changes; Signing.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">If requested by the deponent or a party before completion of the deposition, the deponent shall have 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which to review the transcript or recording and, if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement reciting such changes and the reasons given by the deponent for making them. The officer shall indicate in the certificate prescribed by subdivision (f)(1) whether any review was requested and, if so, shall append any <!-- PDFPage:423 -->changes made by the deponent during the period allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Certification and Delivery by Officer; Exhibits; Copies.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The officer must certify that the witness was duly sworn by the officer and that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by the witness. This certificate must be in writing and accompany the record of the deposition. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the officer must securely seal the deposition in an envelope or package indorsed with the title of the action and marked &ldquo;Deposition of [here insert name of witness]&rdquo; and must promptly send it to the attorney who arranged for the transcript or recording, who must store it under conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration. Documents and things produced for inspection during the examination of the witness must, upon the request of a party, be marked for identification and annexed to the deposition and may be inspected and copied by any party, except that if the person producing the materials desires to retain them the person may (A) offer copies to be marked for identification and annexed to the deposition and to serve thereafter as originals if the person affords to all parties fair opportunity to verify the copies by comparison with the originals, or (B) offer the originals to be marked for identification, after giving to each party an opportunity to inspect and copy them, in which event the materials may then be used in the same manner as if annexed to the deposition. Any party may move for an order that the original be annexed to and returned with the deposition to the court, pending final disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Unless otherwise ordered by the court or agreed by the parties, the officer shall retain stenographic notes of any deposition taken stenographically or a copy of the recording of any deposition taken by another method. Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the officer shall furnish a copy of the transcript or other recording of the deposition to any party or to the deponent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Failure to Attend or to Serve Subpoena; Expenses.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party attends in person or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by that party and that party's attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition of a witness fails to serve a subpoena upon the witness and the witness because of such failure does not attend, and if another party attends in person or by attorney because that party expects the deposition of that witness to be taken, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by that party and that party's attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 32. Use of Depositions in Court Proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Use of Depositions.</strong> At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person designated under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership or association or governmental agency which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> that the witness is dead; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> that the witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> upon application and notice, that the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing, unless the court also finds (i) that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition or (ii) that it is not in the interests of justice, with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(F)</strong> upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A deposition taken without leave of court pursuant to a notice under RCFC 30(a)(2)(C) shall not be used against a party who demonstrates that, when served with the notice, it was unable through the exercise of diligence to obtain counsel to represent it at the taking of the deposition; nor shall a deposition be used against a party who, having received less than 11 days notice of a deposition, has promptly upon receiving such notice filed a motion for a protective order under RCFC 26(c)(2) requesting that the deposition not be held or be held at a different time or place and such motion is pending at the time the deposition is held.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Substitution of parties pursuant to RCFC 25 does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken; and, when an action has been brought in any court of the United States or of any state and another action involving the same subject matter is afterward brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken therefor. A deposition previously taken may also be used as permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Objections to Admissibility.</strong> Subject to the provisions of RCFC 28(b) and subdivision (d)(3) of this rule, objection may be made at the trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Form of Presentation.</strong> Except as otherwise directed by the court, a party offering deposition testimony pursuant to this rule may offer it in stenographic or nonstenographic form, but, if in nonstenographic form, the party shall also provide the court with a transcript of the portions so offered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Errors and Irregularities in Depositions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) As to Notice.</strong> All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served upon the party giving the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) As to Disqualification of Officer.</strong> Objection to taking a deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) As to Taking of Deposition.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> Objections to the form of written questions submitted under RCFC 31 are waived <!-- PDFPage:425 -->unless served in writing upon the party propounding them within the time allowed for serving the succeeding cross or other questions and within 5 days after service of the last questions authorized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) As to Completion and Return of Deposition.</strong> Errors and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, transmitted, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under RCFC 30 and 31 are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 33. Interrogatories to Parties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Availability.</strong> Without leave of court or written stipulation, any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories, not exceeding 25 in number including all discrete subparts, to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Leave to serve additional interrogatories shall be granted to the extent consistent with the principles of RCFC 26(b)(2). Without leave of court or written stipulation, interrogatories may not be served before the time specified in RCFC 26(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Answers and Objections.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the objecting party shall state the reasons for objection and shall answer to the extent the interrogatory is not objectionable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections signed by the attorney making them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories. A shorter or longer time may be directed by the court or, in the absence of such an order, agreed to in writing by the parties subject to RCFC 29.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> All grounds for an objection to an interrogatory shall be stated with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the party's failure to object is excused by the court for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> The party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under RCFC 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Scope; Use at Trial.</strong> Interrogatories may relate to any matters which can be inquired into under RCFC 26(b)(1), and the answers may be used to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has been completed or until a pretrial conference or other later time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Option to Produce Business Records.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit or inspection of such business records, including a compilation, abstract or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts or summaries. A specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Scope.</strong> Any party may serve on any other party a request (1) to produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on the requestor's behalf, to inspect and copy, any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, phonorecords, and other data compilations from which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, by the respondent through detection devices into reasonably usable form), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which constitute or contain matters within the scope of RCFC 26(b) and which are in the possession, custody or control of the party upon whom the request is served; or (2) to permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon, within the scope of RCFC 26(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure.</strong> The request shall set forth, either by individual item or by category, the <!-- PDFPage:426 -->items to be inspected, and describe each with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts. Without leave of court or written stipulation, a request may not be served before the time specified in RCFC 26(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 30 days after the service of the request. A shorter or longer time may be directed by the court or, in the absence of such an order, agreed to by the parties, subject to RCFC 29. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified and inspection permitted of the remaining parts. The party submitting the request may move for an order under RCFC 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Persons Not Parties.</strong> A person not a party to the action may be compelled to produce documents and things or to submit to an inspection as provided in RCFC 45.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Order for Examination.</strong> When the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party's custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Report of Examiner.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> If requested by the party against whom an order is made under RCFC 35(a) or the person examined, the party causing the examination to be made shall deliver to the requesting party a copy of the detailed written report of the examiner setting out the examiner's findings, including results of all tests made, diagnoses and conclusions, together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. After delivery the party causing the examination shall be entitled upon request to receive from the party against whom the order is made a like report of any examination, previously or thereafter made, of the same condition, unless, in the case of a report of examination of a person not a party, the party shows that the party is unable to obtain it. The court on motion may make an order against a party requiring delivery of a report on such terms as are just, and if an examiner fails or refuses to make a report the court may exclude the examiner's testimony if offered at trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> By requesting and obtaining a report of the examination so ordered or by taking the deposition of the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege the party may have in that action or any other involving the same controversy, regarding the testimony of every other person who has examined or may thereafter examine the party in respect of the same mental or physical condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> This subdivision applies to examinations made by agreement of the parties, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise.

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 36. Requests for Admission</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Request for Admission.</strong> A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of RCFC 26(b)(1) set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any documents described in the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. Without leave of court or written stipulation, requests for admission may not be served before the time specified in RCFC 26(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow or as the parties may agree to in writing, subject to RCFC 29, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or by the party's attorney. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless the party states that the party has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by the party is <!-- PDFPage:427 -->insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; the party may, subject to the provisions of RCFC 37(c), deny the matter or set forth reasons why the party cannot admit or deny it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the court determines that an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer be served. If the court determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court may, in lieu of these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be made at a pre-trial conference or at a designated time prior to trial. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Effect of Admission.</strong> Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Subject to the provision of RCFC 16 governing amendment of a pre-trial order, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission by the party for any other purpose nor may it be used against the party in any other proceeding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Motion for Order Compelling Disclosure or Discovery.</strong> A party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby, may apply for an order compelling disclosure or discovery as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Appropriate Court.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Motion.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> If a party fails to make a disclosure required by RCFC 26(a), any other party may move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party not making the disclosure in an effort to secure the disclosure without court action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or submitted under RCFC 30 or 31, or a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a), or a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under RCFC 33, or if a party, in response to a request for inspection submitted under RCFC 34, fails to respond that inspection will be permitted as requested or fails to permit inspection as requested, the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer, or a designation, or an order compelling inspection in accordance with the request. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make the discovery in an effort to secure the information or material without court action. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the examination before applying for an order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response.</strong> For purposes of this subdivision an evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response is to be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Expenses and Sanctions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> If the motion is granted or if the disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the motion was filed, the court shall, after affording an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion or the party or attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds that the motion was filed without the movant's first making a good faith effort to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action, or that the opposing party's nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified, or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> If the motion is denied, the court may enter any protective order authorized under RCFC 26(c) and shall, after affording an opportunity to be heard, require the moving party or the attorney filing the motion or both of them to pay to the party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney's fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may enter any protective order authorized under RCFC 26(c) and may, after affording an opportunity to be heard, apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the parties and persons in a just manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Sanctions Concerning Deponents.</strong> If a deponent fails to be sworn or to answer a question after being directed to do so by the court, the failure may be considered a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Sanctions Concerning Parties.</strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of this rule or RCFC 35, or if a <!-- PDFPage:428 -->party fails to obey an order entered under RCFC 16(b), the court may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> An order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting that party from introducing designated matters in evidence;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> Where a party has failed to comply with an order under RCFC 35(a) requiring the party to produce another for examination, such orders as are listed in paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of this subdivision, unless the party failing to comply shows that that party is unable to produce such person for examination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Failure to Disclose; False or Misleading Disclosure; Refusal to Admit.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by RCFC 26(a) or 26(e)(1), or to amend a prior response to discovery as required by RCFC 26(e)(2), is not, unless such failure is harmless, permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed. In addition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions. In addition to requiring payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, these sanctions may include any of the actions authorized under RCFC 37(b)(2)(A), (B), and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested under RCFC 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, the requesting party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (A) the request was held objectionable pursuant to RCFC 36(a), or (B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (C) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, or (D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Failure of Party To Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers to Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection.</strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under RCFC 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails (1) to appear before the officer who is to take the deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or (2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted under RCFC 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under RCFC 34, after proper service of the request, the court in which the action is pending on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. Any motion specifying a failure under clause (2) or (3) of this subdivision shall include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party failing to answer or respond in an effort to obtain such answer or response without court action. In lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to act or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a protective order as provided by RCFC 26(c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Directly-Related Cases.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> At the time a complaint is filed, the filing attorney (or <em>pro se</em> plaintiff) shall file and serve on all parties who have appeared a Notice of Directly-Related Case(s). Cases are deemed directly related when an earlier-filed case and the action being filed:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> involve the same contract, property or patent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Where a Notice of Directly-Related Cases is filed along with the new complaint, the clerk shall assign the case to the judge to whom the earliest-filed directly-related case is assigned. If the judge to whom the related case is assigned determines that the case in question is not in fact directly related, the judge will return the case to the clerk for random assignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Where the existence of directly-related cases becomes apparent only after initial assignment, the Notice of Directly-Related Cases shall be filed in all related cases, captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case. Solely for the purpose of filing this notice, counsel in the later-filed case may appear in the earlier-filed case. The Notice may be accompanied by a motion to transfer and a suggestion for consolidation under RCFC 42.1. The judge in the earliest-filed case, after consultation with the judge in the later-filed case, will grant or deny the motion to transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Content of the Notice of Directly-Related Case(s). The notice of related case shall contain: the title and case number of the related case; a brief statement of the relationship of the actions according to the criteria set forth in subdivision (a); and a statement addressing whether assignment to a single judge or other action, including consolidation, is or is not likely to conserve judicial resources and promote an efficient determination of the actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Indirectly-Related Cases.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Whenever it appears to a party that there are two or more cases before the court that present common issues of fact and that transfer, consolidation, or the adoption of a coordinated discovery schedule would significantly promote the efficient administration of justice, the party may file a Notice of Indirectly-Related Cases. The notice shall be captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case which is related. Solely for purposes of filing the notice, counsel may appear in an earlier-filed case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The notice shall list the name and docket number of all indirectly-related cases and shall detail the reasons supporting the proposed action. Counsel shall serve all parties in the related cases. The clerk shall file the notice in those cases and furnish a courtesy copy of the notice to the chief judge. Solely for the purpose of responding to the notice, counsel in the related cases may appear in the earliest-filed case to file a response to the notice. The response shall be filed within 21 days of service and captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case. Responses shall be served on counsel in all cases. The clerk shall file copies of the responses in each of the cases and shall furnish courtesy copies to the chief judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The presiding judge of the earliest-filed case shall call a meeting of all of the presiding judges to determine what, if any, action is appropriate. The parties to each action shall be notified of any resulting decision.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 40.2 has no FRCP counterpart. The subject of the rule&mdash;Related Cases&mdash;previously appeared in these rules as RCFC 77(f) (as revised by General Order No. 36). The renumbering of the rule reflects its more logical placement in the structure of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike the predecessor rule, RCFC 40.2 recognizes two types of related cases: directly-related cases and indi<!-- PDFPage:430 -->rectly-related cases. Directly-related cases retain the definition that applied under former RCFC 77(f). Thus, cases that &ldquo;involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims&rdquo; or &ldquo;involve the same contract, property, or patent&rdquo; are deemed to be directly related. Cases that are directly related share an identity of parties and/or subject matter that, for the sake of consistency in outcome, warrant their assignment to a single judge. Indirectly-related cases, by contrast, share only &ldquo;common issues of fact.&rdquo; In the interests of efficiency and the conservation of resources, such cases may warrant consolidated management during their pretrial stage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to recognizing two forms of related cases, RCFC 40.2 also prescribes the notice procedures that are to be followed for the identification of such cases to the court and interested counsel.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) By Plaintiff; by Stipulation.</strong> Subject to the provisions of RCFC 23, and of any statute of the United States, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (i) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs, or (ii) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States an action based on or including the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) By Order of Court.</strong> Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by the United States prior to the service upon it of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.</strong> For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, the court may dismiss on its own motion or defendant may move for dismissal of an action or any claim. Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision of this rule and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, or for failure to join a party under RCFC 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Dismissal of Counterclaim or Third-Party Claim.</strong> The provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim or third-party claim. A voluntary dismissal by the claimant alone pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this rule shall be made before a responsive pleading is served or, if there is none, before the introduction of evidence at the trial or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Costs of Previously-Dismissed Action.</strong> If a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action in any court commences an action based upon or including the same claim against the defendant, the court may make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it may deem proper and may stay the proceedings in the action until the plaintiff has complied with the order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Consolidation.</strong> When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials.</strong> The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Separate Determination of Liability.</strong> Upon stipulation of the parties, approved by the court, or upon order of the court, a trial may be lim<!-- PDFPage:431 -->ited to the issues of law and fact relating to the right of a party to recover, reserving the determination of the amount of recovery, if any, for further proceedings. In any case, whether or not a stipulation or order has been made under subdivision (c) of this rule, the court, upon determining that a party is entitled to recover, may reserve determination of the amount of the recovery for further proceedings. Any motion for reconsideration shall be filed not later than 10 days after a separate determination of liability.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Affirmation in Lieu of Oath.</strong> Whenever under these rules an oath is required to be taken, a solemn affirmation may be accepted in lieu thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Evidence on Motions.</strong> When a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Interpreters.</strong> The court may appoint an interpreter of its own selection and may fix the interpreter's reasonable compensation. The compensation shall be paid out of funds provided by law or by one or more of the parties as the court may direct and may be taxed ultimately as costs, in the discretion of the court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 44. Proof of Official Record</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Authentication.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Domestic.</strong> An official record kept within the United States, or any state, district, or commonwealth, or within a territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or by the officer's deputy, and accompanied by a certificate that such officer has the custody. The certificate may be made by a judge of a court of record of the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the court, or may be made by any public officer having a seal of office and having official duties in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the officer's office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Foreign.</strong> A foreign official record, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof; or a copy thereof, attested by a person authorized to make the attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to the genuineness of the signature and official position (i) of the attesting person, or (ii) of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official position relates to the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position relating to the attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of the documents, the court may, for good cause shown, (i) admit an attested copy without final certification or (ii) permit the foreign official record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification. The final certification is unnecessary if the record and the attestation are certified as provided in a treaty or convention to which the United States and the foreign country in which the official record is located are parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Lack of Record.</strong> A written statement that after diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records designated by the statement, authenticated as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this rule in the case of a domestic record, or complying with the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) of this rule for a summary in the case of a foreign record, is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Other Proof.</strong> This rule does not prevent the proof of official records or of entry or lack of entry therein by any other method authorized by law.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Form (See Appendix of Forms, Forms 6 and 7A); Issuance.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Every subpoena shall</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> state the name of the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> state the title of the action and its docket number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony or to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, documents or tangible things in the possession, custody or control of that person, or to permit inspection of premises, at a time and place therein specified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> set forth the text of subdivisions (c) and (d) of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A command to produce evidence or to permit inspection may be joined with a command to appear at trial or hearing or at deposition, or may be issued separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before service. An attorney as officer of the court, authorized to sign filings under RCFC 83.1, may also issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to such person and, if the person's attendance is commanded, by tendering to that person the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;1821. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be tendered. Prior notice of any commanded production of documents and things or inspection of premises before trial shall be served on each party in the manner prescribed by RCFC 5(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A) of this rule, a subpoena may be served at any place that is within 100 miles of the place of the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection specified in the subpoena; but the court upon proper application and good cause shown may authorize the service of a subpoena at any other place. A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country who is a national or resident of the United States shall issue under the circumstances and in the manner and be served as provided in Title 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Proof of service when necessary shall be made by filing with the clerk of the court a statement of the date and manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the person who made the service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protection of Persons Subject to Subpoenas.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to that subpoena. The court shall enforce this duty and impose upon the party or attorney in breach of this duty an appropriate sanction, which may include, but is not limited to, lost earnings and a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)(A)</strong> A person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, documents or tangible things or inspection of premises need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless commanded to appear for deposition, hearing or trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(B)</strong> Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this rule, a person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying may, within 14 days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than 14 days after service, serve upon the party or attorney designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials or of the premises. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the court. If objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an order to compel the production. Such an order to compel production shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying commanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)(A)</strong> On timely motion, the court shall quash or modify the subpoena if it</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(i)</strong> fails to allow reasonable time for compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(ii)</strong> requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to travel to a place more than 100 miles from the place where that person resides, is employed or regularly transacts business in person, except that, subject to the provisions of clause (c)(3)(B)(iii) of this rule, such a person may in order to attend trial be commanded to travel from any such place, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iii)</strong> requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter and no exception or waiver applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iv)</strong> subjects a person to undue burden.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(B)</strong> If a subpoena</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(i)</strong> requires disclosure of a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(ii)</strong> requires disclosure of an unretained expert's opinion or information not describing <!-- PDFPage:433 -->specific events or occurrences in dispute and resulting from the expert's study made not at the request of any party, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iii)</strong> requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial, the court may, to protect a person subject to or affected by the subpoena, quash or modify the subpoena or, if the party in whose behalf the subpoena is issued shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship and assures that the person to whom the subpoena is addressed will be reasonably compensated, the court may order appearance or production only upon specified conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Duties in Responding to Subpoena.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable the demanding party to contest the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Contempt.</strong> Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued. An adequate cause for failure to obey exists when a subpoena purports to require a nonparty to attend or produce at a place not within the limits provided by clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 52. Findings by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Effect.</strong> In all actions tried upon the facts, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to RCFC 58; and in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall similarly set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action. Requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of review. Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_52_1_target" name="Rule_52_1">1</a></sup> credibility of the witnesses. It will be sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are stated orally and recorded in open court following the close of the evidence or appear in an opinion or memorandum of decision filed by the court. Findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under RCFC 12 or 56 or any other motion except as provided in subdivision (c) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendment.</strong> On a party's motion filed no later than 10 days after entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings&mdash;or make additional findings&mdash;and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under RCFC 59. The sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings may be questioned whether or not the party raising the question objected to the findings, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Judgment on Partial Findings.</strong> If during a trial a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue, or the court may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. Such a judgment shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>

<p class="note-body">The principal change in RCFC 52 relates to the enlargement of subdivision (c) to include, among issues subject to judgment on partial findings, the adjudication of issues critical to the legal sufficiency of a &ldquo;defense.&rdquo; The amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of law may be entered against both plaintiffs <!-- PDFPage:434 -->and defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 53. Masters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Appointment and Compensation.</strong> The chief judge, at the request of the presiding judge, may appoint a special master. As used in these rules, the word &ldquo;master&rdquo; includes a referee, an auditor, an examiner, and an assessor. The compensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties or paid out of any fund or subject matter of the action, which is in the custody and control of the court as the court may direct. The master shall not retain the master's report as security for the master's compensation; but when the party ordered to pay the compensation allowed by the court does not pay it after notice and within the time prescribed by the court, the master is entitled to a writ of execution against the delinquent party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Reference.</strong> A reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule. Save in matters of account and of difficult computation of damages, a reference shall be made only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Powers.</strong> The order of reference to the master may specify or limit the master's powers and may direct the master to report only upon particular issues or to do or perform particular acts or to receive and report evidence only and may fix the time and place for beginning and closing the hearings and for the filing of the master's report. Subject to the specifications and limitations stated in the order, the master has and shall exercise the power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before the master and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the master's duties under the order. The master may require the production before the master of evidence upon all matters embraced in the reference, including the production of all books, papers, vouchers, documents, and writings applicable thereto. The master may rule upon the admissibility of evidence unless otherwise directed by the order of reference and has the authority to put witnesses on oath and may examine them and may call the parties to the action and examine them upon oath. When a party so requests, the master shall make a record of the evidence offered and excluded in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as provided in the Federal Rules of Evidence for a court sitting without a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Proceedings.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Meetings.</strong> When a reference is made, the clerk shall forthwith furnish the master with a copy of the order of reference. Upon receipt thereof unless the order of reference otherwise provides, the master shall forthwith set a time and place for the first meeting of the parties or their attorneys to be held within 20 days after the date of the order of reference and shall notify the parties or their attorneys. It is the duty of the master to proceed with all reasonable diligence. Either party, on notice to the parties and master, may apply to the court for an order requiring the master to speed the proceedings and to make the report. If a party fails to appear at the time and place appointed, the master may proceed <em>ex parte</em> or, in the master's discretion, adjourn the proceedings to a future day, giving notice to the absent party of the adjournment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Witnesses.</strong> The parties may procure the attendance of witnesses before the master by the issuance and service of subpoenas as provided in RCFC 45. If without adequate excuse a witness fails to appear or give evidence, the witness may be punished as for a contempt and be subjected to the consequences, penalties, and remedies provided in RCFC 37 and 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Statement of Accounts.</strong> When matters of accounting are in issue before the master, the master may prescribe the form in which the accounts shall be submitted and in any proper case may require or receive in evidence a statement by a certified public accountant who is called as a witness. Upon objection of a party to any of the items thus submitted or upon a showing that the form of statement is insufficient, the master may require a different form of statement to be furnished, or the accounts or specific items thereof to be proved by oral examination of the accounting parties or upon written interrogatories or in such other manner as the master directs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Report.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Contents and Filing.</strong> The master shall prepare a report upon the matters submitted to the master by the order of reference and, if required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, the master shall set them forth in the report. The master shall file the report with the clerk of the court and serve on all parties notice of the filing. Unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall file with the report a transcript of the proceedings and of the evidence and the original exhibits. Unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall serve a copy of the report on each party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Acceptance of Report.</strong> The court shall accept the master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. Within 10 days after being served with notice of the filing of the report any party may serve written objections thereto upon the other parties. Application to the court for action upon the report and upon objections thereto shall be by motion.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Definition; Form.</strong> &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties.</strong> When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Demand for Judgment.</strong> A judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment. Except as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party's pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Costs; Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Costs Other than Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</strong> Costs other than attorneys&rsquo; fees may be awarded to the prevailing party to the extent permitted by law. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Filing Bill of Costs. A prevailing party may request the clerk to tax allowable costs by filing a Bill of Costs as set forth in the Appendix of Forms (Form 4) within 30 days after the date of final judgment, as defined in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(d)(2)(G). In any case where any costs other than the fee for filing the action are being requested, the bill of costs shall be supported by affidavit and accompanied by a memorandum setting forth the grounds and authorities supporting the request. Any vouchers, receipts or invoices supporting the cost being requested shall be attached as exhibits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Objections to Bill of Costs. (i) An adverse party may object to the Bill of Costs or to any item claimed therein by filing objections within 28 days after the service of the Bill of Costs. Within 7 days after service of the objections, the prevailing party may file a reply. Unless a conference is scheduled by the clerk, the taxation of costs or any disallowance will be made by the clerk on the record. (ii) A party may request the court to review the clerk's action by filing a motion within 14 days after action by the clerk. The court's review of the clerk's action will be made on the existing record unless otherwise ordered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> Costs in Settlements. The clerk will not tax costs on any action terminated by settlement wherein the judgment is entered pursuant to RCFC 68 or is dismissed pursuant to RCFC 41(a). Settlement agreements must resolve any issue relating to costs. In the absence of special agreement, parties will bear their own costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> No Extensions. No extensions of time under this rule will be permitted and the failure of a prevailing party to timely file a Bill of Costs shall constitute a waiver of any claim for costs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Claims for attorneys&rsquo; fees and related nontaxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive law governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial. See Appendix of Forms, Form 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court, the motion must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of final judgment, as defined in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(d)(2)(G); must specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the moving party to the award; and must state the amount sought. If directed by the court, the motion shall also disclose the terms of any agreement with respect to fees to be paid for the services for which claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> The court may determine issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions bearing on issues of evaluation of services for which liability is imposed by the court. The court shall find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in RCFC 52(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> The responding party shall have 28 days from the service of the motion pursuant to subdivision (d)(2)(A) to file a response, to which plaintiff may reply within 14 days after service of the response. After the filing of a motion, and response and reply, if any, the judge will enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed, either specially or pursuant to the rules of the court, or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate. In addition, the court may refer issues relating to the value of services to a special master under RCFC 53 without regard to the provisions of subdivision (b) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> The provisions of subdivisions (d)(2)(A) through (D) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violations of these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 54(d) was revised in several respects. The subdivision was modified to conform its structure to FRCP <!-- PDFPage:436 -->54(d). In addition, the subdivision, as re-written, departs from its FRCP counterpart in several respects:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, because the allowance of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in this court is almost always determined under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412 (a) & (d) (the Equal Access to Justice Act), it was deemed advisable to reflect this fact in paragraph (d)(2) rather than to retain the broader, but potentially misleading, language that appears in FRCP 54(d)(1). <em>See Neal & Co. v. United States</em>, 121 F.3d 683 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, Subdivision (d)(1) was enlarged beyond the scope of its FRCP counterpart by the incorporation of RCFC 77.4 (&ldquo;Taxation of Costs&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, Subdivision (d)(2) brings together relevant sections of its FRCP counterpart and former RCFC 81(e) (&ldquo;Application for Attorneys&rsquo; Fees&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the time periods for objecting to a Bill of Costs and for requesting review of the clerk's action are enlarged.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 55. Default</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Entry.</strong> When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party's default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Judgment.</strong> No judgment by default shall be entered unless the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court. The party entitled to a judgment by default shall apply to the court therefor; but no judgment by default shall be entered against an infant or incompetent person unless represented in the action by a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other such representative who has appeared therein. If the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action, the party (or, if appearing by representative, the party's representative) shall be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior to the hearing on such application. If, in order to enable the court to enter judgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of damages or to establish the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an investigation of any other matter, the court may conduct such hearings or order such references as it deems necessary and proper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Setting Aside Default.</strong> For good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in accordance with RCFC 60(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Plaintiffs; Counterclaimants.</strong> The provisions of this rule apply whether the party entitled to the judgment by default is a plaintiff, a third-party plaintiff, or a party who has pleaded a counterclaim. In all cases a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of RCFC 54(c).</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 55 recognizes the distinction between entry of default and entry of judgment for default. Substantial changes were made. The language in former subdivision (b)(1), permitting entry of default judgment by the clerk, is omitted. Additionally, the protection previously afforded only to the United States&mdash;prohibiting entry of default judgments absent a showing by the claimant of a right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court&mdash;is expanded to include all parties. Judgment requires proof and involvement of the court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 56. Summary Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) For Claimant.</strong> A party seeking to recover upon a claim or counterclaim or to obtain a declaratory judgment may, at any time after the expiration of 60 days from the commencement of the action in this court or after service of a motion for summary judgment by the adverse party, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in such party's favor upon all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) For Defending Party.</strong> A party against whom a claim or counterclaim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in the party's favor as to all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motion and Proceedings Thereon.</strong> The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on Motion.</strong> If on motion under this rule judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel, shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony; Defense Required.</strong> Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith. The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) When Affidavits are Unavailable.</strong> Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons <!-- PDFPage:437 -->stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Affidavits Made in Bad Faith.</strong> Should it appear to the satisfaction of the court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this rule are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order the party employing them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any offending party or attorney may be adjudged guilty of contempt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Procedures.</strong> The following procedures shall be followed with respect to motions for summary judgment other than in actions seeking review of a decision on the basis of an administrative record:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The moving or cross-moving party shall file, together with its motion, a separate document titled Proposed Findings of Uncontroverted Fact. This document shall contain concise, separately numbered paragraphs setting forth all of the material facts upon which the party bases its motion and as to which the party believes there is no genuine dispute. Each paragraph shall contain citations to the opposing party's pleadings or to documentary evidence, such as affidavits or exhibits, filed with the motion or otherwise part of the record in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The opposing party shall file, together with its opposition, a response to the requested findings by indicating, immediately below each finding, whether it agrees or disagrees with the finding as stated. If the opposing party does not agree with the proposed finding, it shall note the basis for its objection and may draft a proposed revision of the finding directly below the challenged finding. The opposing party may also file proposed findings of uncontroverted fact as to any relevant matters not covered by the moving party's statement. Such additional statements of proposed findings shall be set forth with the proposed findings applicable to any cross-motion, but in the absence of a cross-motion shall be set forth in a separate document. Responses to such additional proposed findings shall be filed in a format which conforms to the instructions noted above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The parties may dispense with the documents called for in subdivision (h)(1)&ndash;(2) if they file, no later than the time of the initial motion, a comprehensive stipulation of all of the material facts upon which they intend to rely. In determining any motion for summary judgment, the court will, absent persuasive reason to the contrary, deem the material facts claimed and adequately supported by the moving party to be established, except to the extent that such material facts are controverted by affidavit or other written or oral evidence.</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision structure of RCFC 56 was reordered to more closely conform to FRCP 56. In addition, the subdivision outlining the procedures for filing a RCFC 56 motion was changed to eliminate the Statement of Genuine Issues and to require parties to express their views on any particular fact by noting them on a single page, which may include a redraft of the challenged finding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Standards.</strong> RCFC 56(a)&ndash;(b) applies, with the exception that any supplementation of the administrative record shall be by stipulation or by court order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedures.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The moving or cross-moving party shall file, together with its motion, a separate document titled Statement of Facts setting forth the facts necessary to resolve the issues presented on review. This document shall contain concise, separately numbered paragraphs setting forth all of the facts upon which the party bases its motion and which are supported by the record. Each paragraph shall contain citations to the opposing party's pleadings or to documentary evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The opposing party shall file, together with its opposition or cross-motion, a separate document titled Counter-Statement of Facts. This document shall indicate immediately below each statement of fact whether it agrees or disagrees with the fact as stated. The party shall state the precise nature of its disagreement and give its version of the events supported by record citations. The opposing party may also file Proposed Additional Facts as to any relevant matters not covered by the moving party's statement to which the movant shall respond in like format.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 56.1 has no FRCP counterpart. In the interests of procedural clarity, the text of subdivision (a) was modified to reflect current practice with respect to supplementation of the administrative record and subdivision (b)(2) was modified to make explicit an opposing party's right to file an opposition as well as a cross-motion. In addition, the rule was conformed to RCFC 56 practice, in that the statement of facts and counterstatement of facts are presented in a single document. In other respects, RCFC 56.1 remains unchanged.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Remand.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Issuance of Remand Order.</strong> At the request of a party or on its own motion, the court may in any case within its jurisdiction by order remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as may be deemed proper and just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Content of Remand Order.</strong> An order of remand shall (A) delineate the area of further consideration or action deemed warranted on the remand, (B) fix the duration of the remand period, not to exceed 6 months, and (C) specify the extent to which court proceedings shall be stayed during the remand period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Service of Order.</strong> A certified copy of any order issued pursuant to this rule shall be <!-- PDFPage:438 -->served by the clerk on the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order is directed. A copy of the order shall be served on each party in conformity with RCFC 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Transmittal of Administrative Record.</strong> Following service of the order as provided for in this rule, the clerk shall transmit the administrative record, if any, to the Department of Justice for return to the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order of remand is directed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Advice of Administrative Action.</strong> In every case in which an order of remand is entered pursuant to this rule, the attorney of record for the party so designated in the order of remand shall report to the court the status of proceedings on remand at intervals of 90 days or less, beginning with the date of the order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Extension or Termination of Stay of Proceedings on Remand; Disposition of Case.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Extension.</strong> If the administrative or executive body or official has not, during the period of stay provided for in an order of remand pursuant to subdivision (a), rendered a decision on the matter remanded, the party to whom opportunity was afforded to obtain further administrative consideration shall, by motion pursuant to RCFC 6, request an extension of the stay of proceedings, or, by motion pursuant to RCFC 7, request the initiation of proceedings toward otherwise disposing of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Disposition at Administrative Level.</strong> If, during the period of the stay of proceedings as provided for in a remand order, the parties dispose of the case at the administrative level, the plaintiff shall file a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Decision on Remand.</strong> Upon completion of proceedings pursuant to an order of remand under subdivision (a), the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order was directed shall forward to the clerk for filing 4 copies of the decision or final action on remand. A copy of such decision or action shall be served on each party by the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Action by the Parties.</strong> Within 30 days after the filing of a decision or final action pursuant to subdivision (3), each party shall file with the clerk a notice indicating whether or not the decision or final action on remand affords a satisfactory basis for disposition of the claim at the administrative level, or whether further proceedings before the court are deemed required, and, if such proceedings are desired, what those proceedings should be. A copy of such notice shall be served on each adverse party in conformity with RCFC 5. Thereafter, the court will enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed, either specially or pursuant to the rules of the court, or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A new trial or rehearing or reconsideration may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues, for any of the reasons established by the rules of common law or equity applicable as between private parties in the courts of the United States. On a motion under this rule, the court may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The court, at any time while a suit is pending before it, or after proceedings for review have been instituted, or within 2 years after the final disposition of the suit, may grant the United States a new trial and stay the payment of any judgment upon satisfactory evidence, cumulative or otherwise, that any fraud, wrong, or injustice has been done to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Time for Motion and Response.</strong> Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2), a motion for a new trial, or for amendment or reconsideration of a judgment, shall be filed no later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment. When such a motion is based on affidavits, they shall be filed with the motion. No response to any motion under this rule may be filed, unless requested by the court. The court will not rule in favor of any motion under this rule without first requesting by order a response to the motion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) On Court's Initiative; Notice; Specifying Grounds.</strong> No later than 10 days after entry of judgment the court, on its own, may order a new trial for any reason that would justify granting one on a party's motion. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion. When granting a new trial on its own initiative or for a reason not stated in a motion, the court shall specify the grounds in its order.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Clerical Mistakes.</strong> Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with leave of the appellate court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, Etc.</strong> On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or the party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under RCFC 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to <!-- PDFPage:440 -->relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court. Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill of review, are abolished, and the procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Automatic Stay; Exceptions&mdash;Injunctions and Patent Accountings.</strong> Except as stated herein, no execution shall issue upon a judgment nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of 10 days after its entry. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction, or a judgment or order directing an accounting in an action for infringement of letters patent, shall not be stayed during the period after its entry and until an appeal is taken or during the pendency of an appeal. The provisions of subdivision (c) of this rule govern the suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting of an injunction during the pendency of an appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Stay on Motion for New Trial or for Judgment.</strong> In its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, the court may stay the execution of or any proceedings to enforce a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment made pursuant to RCFC 59, or of a motion for relief from a judgment or order made pursuant to RCFC 60, or of a motion for amendment to the findings or for additional findings made pursuant to RCFC 52(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Injunction Pending Appeal.</strong> When an appeal is taken from an interlocutory or final judgment granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction, the court in its discretion may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Stay Upon Appeal.</strong> When an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay subject to the exceptions contained in subdivision (a) of this rule. The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the appeal, as the case may be. The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Stay in Favor of the United States or Agency Thereof.</strong> When an appeal is taken by the United States or an officer or agency thereof or by direction of any department of the Government of the United States and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall be required from the appellant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Stay According to State Law.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Power of Appellate Court Not Limited.</strong> The provisions in this rule do not limit any power of an appellate court or of a judge or justice thereof to stay proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of an appeal or to make any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Stay of Judgment as to Multiple Claims or Multiple Parties.</strong> When a court has ordered a final judgment under the conditions stated in RCFC 54(b), the court may stay enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Preliminary Injunction.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Notice.</strong> No preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Consolidation of Hearing With Trial on Merits.</strong> Before or after the commencement of the hearing of an application for a preliminary <!-- PDFPage:441 -->injunction, the court may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application. Even when this consolidation is not ordered, any evidence received upon an application for a preliminary injunction which would be admissible upon the trial on the merits becomes part of the record on the trial and need not be repeated upon the trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Temporary Restraining Order; Notice; Hearing; Duration.</strong> A temporary restraining order may be granted without written or oral notice to the adverse party or that party's attorney only if (1) it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant before the adverse party or that party's attorney can be heard in opposition, and (2) the applicant's attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if any, which have been made to give the notice and the reasons supporting the attorney's claim that notice should not be required. Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be indorsed with the date and hour of issuance; shall be filed forthwith in the clerk's office and entered of record; shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 10 days, as the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered of record. In case a temporary restraining order is granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence of all matters except older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes on for hearing the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for a preliminary injunction and, if the party does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On 2 days&rsquo; notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification and in that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Security.</strong> No restraining order or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. No such security shall be required of the United States or of an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of RCFC 65.1 apply to a surety upon a bond or undertaking under this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Form and Scope of Injunction or Restraining Order.</strong> Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.</p>

The surety's liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and such notice of the motion as the court prescribes may be served on the clerk of the court, who shall forthwith mail copies to the sureties if their addresses are known.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Sureties.</strong> Acceptable sureties on bonds shall be those bonding companies holding certificates of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury.

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 68. Offer of Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof, and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment. An offer not accepted <!-- PDFPage:442 -->shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs. If the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer. The fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not preclude a subsequent offer. When the liability of one party to another has been determined by order or judgment, but the amount or extent of the liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party adjudged liable may make an offer of judgment, which shall have the same effect as an offer made before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not less than 10 days prior to the commencement of hearings to determine the amount or extent of liability.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Court Always Open.</strong> The court shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing any pleading or other proper paper, of issuing and returning process, and of making and directing all interlocutory motions, orders, and rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Trials and Hearings; Proceedings in Chambers.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Proceedings Generally.</strong> All trials upon the merits shall be conducted in open court and so far as convenient in a regular courtroom. All other acts or proceedings may be done or conducted by a judge in chambers, without the attendance of the clerk or other court officials or at any other place designated by order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Trials or Hearings in Foreign Countries.</strong> Upon motion of a party or upon the judge's own initiative, and upon a determination by the judge to whom the case is assigned that the interests of economy, efficiency, and justice will be served, the chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims may issue an order authorizing a judge of the court to conduct proceedings, including evidentiary hearings and trials, in a foreign country whose laws do not prohibit such proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Clerk's Office and Orders by Clerk.</strong> The clerk's office with the clerk or a deputy in attendance shall be open during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and the following holidays: New Year's Day, Inauguration Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and any other day designated as a holiday by the President or the Congress of the United States. All motions and applications in the clerk's office for issuing process, process to enforce and execute judgments, for entering defaults or judgments by default, and for other proceedings which do not require allowance or order of the court are grantable of course by the clerk; but the clerk's action may be suspended or altered or rescinded by the court upon cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Notice of Orders or Judgments.</strong> Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice of the entry in the manner provided for in RCFC 5 upon each party who is not in default for failure to appear and shall make a note in the docket of the service. Any party may in addition serve a notice of such entry in the manner provided in RCFC 5 for the service of papers. Lack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in Rule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>

<p class="note-body">In order to more closely parallel the structure and content of FRCP 77, RCFC 77 has been modified as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivisions (a) (referring to the court's &ldquo;Name&rdquo;), (b) (referring to the court's &ldquo;Seal&rdquo;), (d) (captioned &ldquo;Citations&rdquo;) and (e) (identifying the court's judicial power as being exercisable by a single judge, except in congressional reference cases), have been deleted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) (formerly subdivision (h) of this rule) is changed in two respects. First, in order better to reflect its content, the subdivision is retitled to read &ldquo;Trials and Hearings; Proceedings in Chambers&rdquo; (in lieu of &ldquo;Trials and Hearings; Orders in Chambers&rdquo;). Second, the subdivision has been divided into paragraphs (1) and (2). Paragraph (1), captioned &ldquo;Proceedings Generally,&rdquo; retains the rule's earlier language; paragraph (2), captioned &ldquo;Trials or Hearings in Foreign Countries,&rdquo; is new. Paragraph (2) was added to recognize the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. &sect;798(b) to conduct trials or hearings in foreign countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (f) (titled &ldquo;Assignment of Cases&rdquo;) was renumbered as RCFC 40.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (g) (titled &ldquo;Signing of Orders for Absent Judges&rdquo;) was renumbered as RCFC 77.2(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivisions (<em>l</em>) & (k) (titled, respectively, &ldquo;Scheduling Courtrooms&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fee Schedule&rdquo;), were renumbered as RCFC 77.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, former subdivision (m) was deleted in order to recognize the right of certain court employees to participate in pro bono legal work under the guidelines prescribed for that purpose by the Codes of Conduct for Judicial Employees.</p>

The fact of withdrawal shall be preserved in the court's docketing entries.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (c), formerly subdivision (d), was rewritten to clarify the practice with respect to the disposition of physical exhibits and to make clear the parties&rsquo; obligation to retrieve such exhibits, to avoid their loss through routine disposal. The reference to <em>in camera</em> materials was omitted, because such materials are not filed with the Office of the Clerk.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 80.1 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule's principal text formerly appeared in these rules as Appendix A. The incorporation of former Appendix A into the main body of the rules reflects a more logical placement of its subject matter in the organizational structure of the court's rules. Additionally, as part of this rule's relocation, Forms A and B of former Appendix A (pertaining to reporter certifications) were assigned to the new Appendix of Forms. They appear there as Forms 3A and 3B.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes introduced in this rule include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) of the rule formerly appeared in these rules as paragraph (b)(1) of RCFC 39. The changes introduced in new subdivision (a) were deemed necessary in order to eliminate uncertainty as to the court's authority to furnish a reporter for trials scheduled outside of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) of the rule formerly appeared as paragraph (b)(2) of RCFC 39.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (i) of the rule formerly appeared as paragraph (b)(3) of RCFC 39. Additionally, subdivision (i) reflects the change in the court's name.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Attorneys Eligible to Practice.</strong> Only attorneys who are members of the bar of this court and who comply with these rules may enter an appearance, file pleadings, and practice in this court, provided that any attorney admitted to practice before the highest court of any state, territory, possession or the District of Columbia may participate <em>pro hac vice</em> in any proceeding at the request of and in the presence of the attorney of record for a party to the proceeding, or otherwise with the approval of the court. All attorneys who were members in good standing of the bar of the United States Court of Claims are eligible to practice herein. See RCFC 83.1(c)(2) concerning authorization to sign filings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Admission to Practice.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Qualifications; Oath.</strong> Any person of good moral character who has been admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the highest court of any state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia, and is in good standing therein, may be admitted to practice before this court upon oral motion or by verified application, as provided in this rule, and upon taking or subscribing to the following oath: I, &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and that I will conduct myself in an upright manner as an attorney of this court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Upon Oral Motion.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A) In Washington, D.C.</strong> An oral motion for admission may be made by a member of the bar of this court before any judge, and the judge or the clerk shall administer the oath. Motions for admission will be heard the first Thursday of each month which is not a legal holiday as defined by RCFC 6(a). Where the first Thursday of the month falls on a legal holiday, admissions will be held on the second Thursday of the month. Applicants for admission must appear in the clerk's office no later than 9:30 a.m. to pay the admission fee and fill out the necessary papers. Motions will be heard promptly at 10:00 a.m., in Courtroom No. 4, Room 501, National Courts Building, 717 Madison Place, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Applicants who for special reasons are unable to appear for admission on the first Thursday of the month should contact the Office of the Clerk to make appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B) Outside Washington, D.C.</strong> An oral motion for admission may be made by a member of the bar of this court before a judge outside Washington, D.C., who shall administer the oath. As a preliminary to the motion, the attorney who moves the admission shall submit to the judge the appropriate form obtained from the judge and completed <!-- PDFPage:446 -->by the applicant. In the absence of an oral motion for admission in conformity with this subdivision, the applicant may advise the judge of the applicant's qualifications as set forth in subdivision (b)(1). Upon consideration thereof, and upon representation by the attorney that such attorney will promptly apply to the clerk for admission by verified application as provided in subdivision (b)(3), the judge may permit the applicant to participate in the particular proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) By Verified Application.</strong> Without need for appearing in person, admission may be made upon presentation to the clerk of a verified application showing that the applicant is possessed of the qualifications described in subdivision (b)(1). See Appendix of Forms, Form 1. The application shall be accompanied by: (A) a certificate of a judge or of the clerk of any of the courts specified in subdivision (b)(1) indicating that the applicant is a member of the bar of such court and is in good standing therein; (B) two letters or signed statements of members of the bar of this court or of the Supreme Court of the United States, not related to the applicant, affirming that the applicant is personally known to them, that the applicant possesses all the qualifications required for admission to the bar of this court, that they have examined the application, and that the applicant's personal and professional character and standing are good; and (C) an oath in the form prescribed in subdivision (b)(1) signed by the applicant and administered by an officer authorized to administer oaths in the state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia, where the oath is administered, or as permitted by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Fee for Admission.</strong> Unless the applicant is an attorney representing the United States before this court, an admission fee as provided for in RCFC 77.1 (c)(2) shall be paid in advance in cash or by check payable to &ldquo;Clerk, United States Court of Federal Claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Admission of Foreign Attorneys.</strong> An attorney, barrister, or advocate who is qualified to practice in the highest court of any foreign state may be specially admitted for purposes limited to a particular case. Such attorney, barrister or advocate shall not, however, be authorized to act as attorney of record. In the case of such applicants, the oath shall not be required and there shall be no fee. Such admission shall be only on written motion of a member of the bar of this court, filed with the clerk at least 3 days prior to the consideration of the motion by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Attorneys of Record.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) One for Each Party.</strong> There shall be but one attorney of record for a party in any case at any one time, and such attorney of record shall be an individual (and not a firm) who has been admitted to practice before this court. Any other attorneys assisting the attorney of record shall be designated as &ldquo;of counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Authorization to Sign Filings.</strong> Any attorney who is a member of the bar of this court may sign any filing in the attorney of record's name. An attorney who signs the name of the attorney of record shall so indicate by adding the following after the name of the attorney of record: &ldquo;by [the signing attorney's full name].&rdquo; Authorization to sign filings shall not relieve the attorney of record from the provisions of RCFC 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Appearance.</strong> For parties other than the United States, the attorney of record shall include on the initial pleading or paper said attorney's name, address, telephone, and facsimile number. For the United States the attorney who is to appear as the attorney of record shall, promptly after service of the complaint, file with the clerk and serve on all other parties a notice of appearance setting forth the identical information. The attorneys of record for all parties shall promptly file with the clerk and serve on all other parties a notice of any change in address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Change by Parties Other than the United States.</strong> A party other than the United States may by leave of court on motion change the party's attorney at any time. The motion may be signed by said party in person or by the newly designated attorney accompanied by an affidavit of appointment executed by such attorney. If the consent of the previous attorney of record is annexed to or endorsed on the motion, substitution shall be accomplished by an appropriate entry on the docket by the clerk. When the motion is not thus shown to have the consent of the previous attorney, such attorney shall be served with the motion, and shall have 14 days to show cause why the motion should not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Change by the United States.</strong> A new notice of appearance shall be filed and served on all parties by the United States whenever a case is reassigned to another attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Withdrawal of Attorney.</strong> No attorney of record for a plaintiff or a third party may withdraw such attorney's appearance except by leave of the court on motion and after notice is served on such attorney's client.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7) Death of Attorney.</strong> If the attorney of record dies, a suggestion of such attorney's death shall be made, and a motion to substitute another attorney admitted to practice before this court may be made by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(8) Unrepresented Party.</strong> An individual may represent oneself or a member of one's immediate family as a party before the court. Any other party, however, must be represented by an attorney who is admitted to practice in this court. A corporation may only be represented by counsel. The terms counsel or attorney in these rules shall include unrepresented parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Honorary Membership.</strong> Honorary membership in the bar of the court may be granted from time to time to distinguished professionals of the United States or of other nations who are knowledgeable in the affairs of law and government in their respective countries. After nomination by the chief judge and approval by the court, the candidate for honorary membership will be presented at the bar in person. A certificate of honorary membership in the bar will be presented to the person so honored.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 83.2. Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement.</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Court of Federal Claims, in furtherance of its inherent power and responsibility to supervise the conduct of attorneys who are admitted to practice before it, or admitted for the purpose of a particular proceeding pursuant to RCFC 83.1(a) and (b)(5), promulgates the following Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement superseding all of its other rules pertaining to disciplinary enforcement heretofore promulgated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Attorneys Convicted of Crimes.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Upon the filing with the court of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction demonstrating that any attorney admitted to practice before the court has been convicted in any court of the United States, or the District of Columbia, or of any state, territory, commonwealth or possession of the United States of a serious crime as hereinafter defined, the court shall enter an order immediately suspending that attorney, whether the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or from a verdict after trial or otherwise, and regardless of the pendency of any appeal, until final disposition of a disciplinary proceeding to be commenced upon such conviction. A copy of such order shall immediately be served upon the attorney. Upon good cause shown, the court may set aside such order when it appears in the interest of justice so to do.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The term serious crime shall include any felony and any lesser crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of such crime in the jurisdiction where the judgment was entered, involves false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, willful failure to file income tax returns, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or an attempt or a conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a serious crime.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> A certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for any crime shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against that attorney based upon the conviction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for a serious crime, the court shall, in addition to suspending that attorney in accordance with the provisions of this rule, refer the matter to counsel for the institution of a disciplinary proceeding before the court in which the sole issue to be determined shall be the extent of the final discipline to be imposed as a result of the conduct resulting in the conviction, provided that a disciplinary proceeding so instituted will not be brought to final hearing until all appeals from the conviction are concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment of conviction of an attorney for a crime not constituting a serious crime, the court may refer the matter to counsel for whatever action counsel may deem warranted, including the institution of a disciplinary proceeding before the court; provided, however, that the court may in its discretion make no reference with respect to convictions for minor offenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> An attorney suspended under the provisions of this rule will be reinstated immediately upon the filing of a certificate demonstrating that the underlying conviction of a serious crime has been reversed, but the reinstatement will not terminate any disciplinary proceeding then pending against the attorney, the disposition of which shall be determined by the court on the basis of all available evidence pertaining to both guilt and the extent of discipline to be imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discipline Imposed by Other Courts; Disbarment on Consent or Representation in Other Courts.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court shall, upon being subjected to public discipline by any other court of the United States or District of Columbia, or by a court of any state, territory, commonwealth or possession of the United States, promptly inform the clerk of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court shall, upon being disbarred on consent or resigning from the bar of any other court of the United States or the District of Columbia, or from the bar of any state, territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States while an investigation into allegations of misconduct is pending, promptly inform the clerk of such disbarment on consent or resignation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Upon the filing of a certified copy of a judgment or order demonstrating that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been disciplined by another court or upon accepting disbarment on consent or resignation, the court shall forthwith issue a notice directed to the attorney containing: a copy of the judgment or order from the other court or a copy of the communication indicating disbarment on consent or resignation; and an order to show cause directing that the attorney inform the court within 30 days after service of that order upon the attorney, personally or by mail of any claim by the attorney predicated upon the grounds set forth in paragraph (5), and that the imposition of the identical discipline by the court would be unwarranted and the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> In the event the discipline imposed in the other jurisdiction has been stayed there, any <!-- PDFPage:448 -->reciprocal discipline imposed in the court shall be deferred until such stay expires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> Upon the expiration of 30 days from service of the notice issued pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (3), the court shall impose the identical discipline unless the respondent-attorney demonstrates, or the court finds, that upon the face of the record upon which the discipline in another jurisdiction is predicated it clearly appears:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> that the procedure was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> or that there was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that the court could not, consistent with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on that subject;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> or that the imposition of the same discipline by the court would result in grave injustice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> or that the misconduct established is deemed by the court to warrant substantially different discipline.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">Where the court determines that any of said elements exist, it shall enter such other order as it deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> In all other respects, a final adjudication in another court that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct shall establish conclusively the misconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> The court may at any stage appoint counsel to prosecute the disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Standards for Professional Conduct.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> For misconduct defined in this rule and after notice and opportunity to be heard, any attorney admitted to practice before the court may be disbarred, suspended from practice before the court, publicly reprimanded, or subjected to such other disciplinary action as the circumstances may warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Acts or omissions by an attorney admitted to practice before the court, individually or in concert with any other person or persons, which violate the Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by the court shall constitute misconduct and shall be grounds for discipline, whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship. The Code of Professional Responsibility adopted by the court is the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, as amended from time to time by the Association, except as otherwise provided by specific rule of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Disciplinary Proceedings</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> When misconduct or allegations of misconduct which, if substantiated, would warrant discipline on the part of an attorney admitted to practice before the court shall come to the attention of a judge or special master of the court, whether by complaint or otherwise, and the applicable procedure is not otherwise mandated by this rule, the judge or special master shall refer the matter to the chief judge for determination whether the matter should be referred to a disciplinary judge for a formal disciplinary proceeding or the formulation of such other recommendation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Should the disciplinary judge conclude after review that a formal disciplinary proceeding should not be initiated against the respondent-attorney because sufficient evidence is not present, or because there is pending another proceeding against the respondent-attorney the disposition of which in the judgment of the disciplinary judge should be awaited before further action by the court is considered or for any other valid reason, the disciplinary judge shall file with the court a recommendation for disposition of the matter, whether by dismissal, admonition, deferral, or otherwise setting forth the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> To initiate formal disciplinary proceedings, the disciplinary judge shall file an order of the court upon a showing of probable cause requiring the respondent-attorney to show cause within 30 days after service of that order upon that attorney, personally, or by mail, why the attorney should not be disciplined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Upon the respondent-attorney's answer to the order to show cause, if any issue of fact is raised or the respondent-attorney wishes to be heard in mitigation, the disciplinary judge shall set the matter for prompt hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Disbarment on Consent While Under Disciplinary Investigation or Prosecution</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Any attorney admitted to practice before the court who is the subject of an investigation into or a pending proceeding involving allegations of misconduct may consent to disbarment, but only by delivering to the court an affidavit stating that the attorney desires to consent to disbarment and that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the attorney's consent is freely and voluntarily rendered; the attorney is not being subjected to coercion or duress; the attorney is fully aware of the implications of so consenting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the attorney is aware that there is a presently pending investigation or proceeding involving allegations that there exist grounds for the attorney's discipline the nature of which the attorney shall specifically set forth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> the attorney acknowledges that the material facts so alleged are true; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> the attorney so consents because the attorney knows that if charges were predicated upon the matters under investigation, or if the proceeding were prosecuted, the attorney could not successfully defend himself.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Upon receipt of the required affidavit, the court shall enter an order disbarring the attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The order disbarring the attorney on consent shall be a matter of public record. However, the affidavit required under the provisions of this rule shall not be publicly disclosed or made available for use in any other proceeding except upon order of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Reinstatement.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) After Disbarment or Suspension.</strong> An attorney suspended for three months or less shall be automatically reinstated at the end of the period of suspension upon the filing with the court of an affidavit of compliance with <!-- PDFPage:449 -->the provisions of the order. An attorney suspended for more than three months or disbarred may not resume practice until reinstated by order of the court, except as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Time of Application Following Disbarment.</strong> A person who has been disbarred after hearing or by consent may not apply for reinstatement until the expiration of at least one year from the effective day of the disbarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Hearing on Application.</strong> Petitions for reinstatement by a disbarred or suspended attorney under this rule shall be filed with the Clerk, and directed to the chief judge of the court. Such petitions shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner has the moral qualifications, competency and learning in the law before the court and that the petitioner's resumption to the practice of law will not be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the bar or to the administration of justice, or subversive of the public interest. Upon receipt of the petition, the chief judge shall promptly assign the petition to one or more judges of the court for prompt action. The judge or judges assigned to the matter shall within 30 days after referral issue an order of reinstatement based upon the petition or, schedule a hearing at which the petitioner shall have the burden of demonstrating the elements listed above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Deposit for Costs of Proceeding.</strong> The court may direct that petitions for reinstatement under this rule shall be accompanied by an advance cost deposit in an amount to be set from time to time by the court to cover anticipated costs of the reinstatement proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Conditions of Reinstatement.</strong> If the petitioner is found unfit to resume the practice of law, the petition shall be dismissed. If the petitioner is found fit to resume the practice of law, the judgment shall reinstate the petitioner, provided that the judgment may make reinstatement conditional upon the payment of all or part of the costs of the proceedings, and upon the making of partial or complete restitution to parties harmed by the petitioner whose conduct led to the suspension or disbarment. Provided further, that if the petitioner has been suspended or disbarred for 5 years or more, reinstatement may be conditioned, in the discretion of the judge or judges before whom the matter is heard, upon the furnishing of proof of competency and learning in law, which proof may include certification by the bar examiners of a state or other jurisdiction of the attorney's successful completion of an examination for admission to practice subsequent to the date of suspension or disbarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Successive Petitions.</strong> No petition for reinstatement under this Appendix shall be filed within one year following an adverse judgment upon a petition for reinstatement filed by or on behalf of the same person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Attorneys Specially Admitted.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an attorney applies to be admitted or is admitted to the court for purposes of a particular proceeding pursuant to RCFC 83.1(a) or(b)(5), the attorney shall be deemed thereby to have conferred disciplinary jurisdiction upon the court for any alleged misconduct of that attorney arising in the course of or in the preparation for such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Service of Papers and Other Notices.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Service of an order to show cause instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding shall be made by personal service or by registered or certified mail addressed to the respondent-attorney at such attorney's last known address. If service by registered or certified mail is ineffective, the court shall enter an order as appropriate to effect service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Service of any other papers or notices required by this rule shall be deemed to have been made if such paper or notice is addressed to the respondent-attorney at such attorney's last known address or the respondent-attorney at the address indicated in the most recent pleading or other document filed in the course of any proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Appointment of Counsel.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The court may appoint as counsel one or more members of the bar of the court to investigate allegations of misconduct or to prosecute disciplinary proceedings under this rule, provided, however, that the respondent-attorney may move to disqualify an attorney so appointed who is or has been engaged as an adversary of the respondent-attorney in any matter. Counsel, once appointed, may not resign unless permission to do so is given by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(j) Payment of Fees and Costs.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">At the conclusion of any disciplinary investigation or prosecution, if any, under this rule, counsel may make application to the court for an order awarding reasonable fees and reimbursing costs expended in the course of such disciplinary investigation or prosecution. Any such order shall be submitted to the clerk who shall pay the amount required thereunder from the funds collected pursuant to subdivision (j).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(k) Duties of the Clerk.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Upon being informed that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been convicted of any crime, the clerk shall determine whether the clerk of the convicting court has forwarded a certificate of such conviction to the court. If a certificate has not been so forwarded, the clerk shall promptly obtain a certificate and file it with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Upon being informed that an attorney admitted to practice before the court has been subjected to discipline by another court, the clerk shall determine whether a certified copy of the disciplinary judgment or order has been filed with the court, and, if not, the clerk shall promptly obtain a certified copy of the disciplinary judgment or order and file it with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Whenever it appears that any person disbarred or suspended or censured or disbarred on consent by the court is admitted to practice law in any other jurisdiction or before any other court, the clerk shall, within 10 days of that disbarment, suspension, censure, or disbarment on consent, transmit to the disciplinary authority in such other jurisdiction, or for such other court, a certified copy of the order of disbarment, suspension, censure, or disbarment on consent, as well as the last <!-- PDFPage:450 -->known office and residence address of the defendant or respondent-attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> The clerk shall notify the National Discipline Data Bank operated by the American Bar Association of any order imposing public discipline upon any attorney admitted to practice before the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> The clerk shall utilize a portion of the fee for admission required by RCFC 77.1(c) to defray the payment of fees and costs under subdivision (i) of this rule and any other costs incurred by the administration of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(<em>l</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong>) Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this rule shall be construed to deny to the court such powers as are necessary for the court to maintain control over proceedings conducted before it, such as proceedings for contempt, issuance of public reprimands, or imposition of fines of not more than $1,000.00.</p>

<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">CASE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE</h3>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">I. PURPOSE</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>1.</strong> These case management procedures are intended to promote cooperation among counsel, assist in the early identification of issues, minimize the cost and delay of litigation and enhance the potential for settlement. (As used in this appendix, &ldquo;counsel&rdquo; shall be construed to include unrepresented parties.)</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>2.</strong> Uniformity of practice within the court also is an important goal of these procedures. For the purpose of promoting the efficient administration of justice, a judge may modify these procedures as appropriate, or the parties may suggest the modification of these procedures to meet the needs of a particular case.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">II. EARLY MEETING OF COUNSEL</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3.</strong> Subsequent to the filing of defendant's answer or, if applicable, a reply to a counterclaim, and, in any event, within sufficient time to permit the parties to file a Joint Preliminary Status Report in accordance with paragraph 4, plaintiff's counsel shall communicate with defense counsel, and counsel shall confer:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(a)</strong> To initiate preparation of the Joint Preliminary Status Report pursuant to paragraphs 4&ndash;6.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b)</strong> To identify each party's factual and legal contentions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(c)</strong> To discuss each party's discovery needs and discovery schedule, including the initial disclosures required by RCFC 26(a)(1) and additional documents that are to be the subject of discovery, <em>e.g.</em>, determine what is needed; the objections, if any, to supplying it; and where it is available, with follow-up letters to provide a record. Informal discovery is encouraged. The parties are encouraged to cooperate in the conduct of discovery and to make additional <!-- PDFPage:452 -->voluntary disclosures through informal discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(d)</strong> To discuss the expected means of resolving the dispute, i.e., whether by trial or dispositive motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(e)</strong> To discuss settlement of the action, including use of alternative dispute resolution. See Appendix H.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Participating counsel shall be counsel of record and such other attorneys as necessary so that participating counsel for each party are knowledgeable about the case and the identity of witnesses and location of documents.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">III. JOINT PRELIMINARY STATUS REPORT</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>4.</strong> No later than 49 days after defendant's answer or plaintiff's reply to a counterclaim is served, the parties shall file with the clerk a Joint Preliminary Status Report signed by both parties, setting forth answers to the following questions. Separate views may be set forth on any point on which parties cannot agree.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(a)</strong> Does the court have jurisdiction over the action?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b)</strong> Should the case be consolidated with any other case and the reasons therefor?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(c)</strong> Should trial of liability and damages be bifurcated and the reasons therefor?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(d)</strong> Should further proceedings in this case be deferred pending consideration of another case before this court or any other tribunal and the reasons therefor?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(e)</strong> In cases other than tax refund actions, will a remand or suspension be sought and the reasons therefor and the proposed duration?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(f)</strong> Will additional parties be joined and, if so, a statement describing such parties, their relationship to the case, and the efforts to effect joinder and the schedule proposed to effect joinder?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(g)</strong> Does either party intend to file a motion pursuant to RCFC 12(b), 12(c) or 56 and, if so, a schedule for the intended filing?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(h)</strong> What are the relevant factual and legal issues?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(i)</strong> What is the likelihood of settlement? Is alternative dispute resolution contemplated?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(j)</strong> Do the parties anticipate proceeding to trial? Does any party, or do the parties jointly, request expedited trial scheduling and, if so, the reasons why the case is appropriate therefor? A request for expedited trial scheduling is generally appropriate when the parties anticipate that discovery, if any, can be completed within a 90-day period, the case may be tried within 3 days, no dispositive motion is anticipated, and a bench ruling is sought. The requested place of trial shall be stated. Before such a request is made, the parties shall confer specifically on this subject.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(k)</strong> Are there special issues regarding electronic case management needs?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(<em>l</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong>)</strong> Is there other information of which the court should be aware at this time?</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>5.</strong> If discovery is required, the Joint Preliminary Status Report should set forth a proposed discovery plan, including proposed deadlines. The parties should propose a deadline for fact discovery, for the disclosure of any experts&rsquo; reports, and for depositions or other discovery of experts. See RCFC 26(a)(2) concerning disclosure of experts and discovery planning.</p>

In the interest of justice and judicial economy, a Preliminary Scheduling Conference will not be scheduled if, in the court's discretion, further discussion of the matters presented in the Joint Preliminary Status Report would not be useful.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>8. Scheduling Order.</strong> After the preliminary scheduling conference or, if none is held, after the filing of the Joint Preliminary Status Report, the judge shall promptly enter the scheduling order called for by RCFC 16(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b) Witnesses.</strong> Exchange a final list of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of witnesses, including expert witnesses, who may be called at trial for case-in-chief or rebuttal purposes, except those to be used exclusively for impeachment. Failure of a party to list a witness shall result, absent agreement of the parties or a showing of a compelling reason for the failure, in the exclusion of that witness&rsquo; testimony at trial. Any witness whose identity has not been previously disclosed shall be subject to discovery. As to each witness, the party shall indicate the specific topics to be addressed in the expected testimony.</p>

Exhibit List.</strong> Each party shall file, together with the Memorandum of Contentions of Fact and Law, a separate statement setting forth a list of exhibits it expects to offer at trial for case-in-chief or rebuttal purposes (including summaries to be offered pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 1006), other than those to be used exclusively for impeachment. The exhibit list shall separately identify those exhibits which the party expects to offer and those which the party may offer if the need arises.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>17. Stipulations.</strong> The parties are encouraged before or after the pretrial conference to file a stipulation setting forth all matters as to which they agree.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">VII. OTHER MATTERS</h3>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Appendix A represents the court's standard pretrial order. The case management procedures contained in Appendix A reflect those procedures which, in the collective experience of the court and the members of its bar, are considered most beneficial in securing the prompt and expeditious resolution of claims and disputes. Some important changes have been introduced. Chief among these are procedures calling for a preliminary scheduling conference to be set following the filing of the Joint Preliminary Status Report, and a post-discovery conference following the completion of discovery. The expectation reflected in these conference procedures is that early and ongoing involvement of the court during the pretrial development of a case can contribute both to a prompt identification of the issues and to a narrowing of the scope of the dispute.</p>
<p class="note-body">The promulgation of Appendix A as a synthesis of the views of the bench and the bar is intended to encourage standardization in pretrial practice procedures. Appendix A recognizes, however, that the pretrial procedures to be followed in any particular case ultimately depend upon the needs of that case. Hence, Appendix A permits modifications of its procedures, either at a judge's initiative (or at the parties&rsquo; suggestion), when such modification will promote &ldquo;the efficient administration of justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Assignment.</strong> Once a petition has been filed by the clerk, the case shall be assigned by the chief special master to a special master to conduct proceedings in accordance with the Vaccine Rules. All proceedings prior to the issuance of the special master's decision are to be conducted exclusively by the special master.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Duties.</strong> The special master shall be responsible for conducting all proceedings, including requiring such evidence as may be appropriate, in order to prepare a decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining whether an award of compensation should be made under the Vaccine Act and the amount of any such award. The special master shall determine the nature of the proceedings, with the goal of making the proceedings expeditious, flexible, and less adversarial, while at the same time affording each party a full and fair opportunity to present its case and creating a record sufficient to allow review of the special master's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Absence; Reassignment.</strong> In the absence of the special master to whom a case is assigned, the chief special master may act on behalf of the assigned special master, or designate another special master to act. When necessary for the efficient administration of justice, the chief special master may reassign a case to another special master.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 4. Respondent's Review and Report.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Respondent's Review of Completeness of the Records.</strong> Within 30 days of the filing of a petition, respondent shall review the medical and other records to determine whether, in respondent's view, all records necessary to enable respondent to evaluate the merits of the claim have been supplied with the petition. If respondent considers that relevant records are missing, respondent's counsel shall immediately notify petitioner's counsel regarding the perceived omissions. If the parties disagree about the completeness of the records filed or the relevance of requested records, either party may request that the special master resolve the matter. If the special master concludes that records called for by Vaccine Rule 2(e) have not been submitted, the petition may be subject to dismissal, without prejudice, under Vaccine Rule 21(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Respondent's Report.</strong> Within 90 days after the filing of the petition, respondent shall file a report that shall set forth a full and complete statement of respondent's position as to why an award should or should not be granted. The report shall contain respondent's medical analysis of petitioner's claims. It shall also present any legal arguments that respondent may have in opposition to the petition. General denials are not sufficient.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 5. Informal Review and Tentative Findings and Conclusions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The special master shall schedule an off-the-record conference to be held within 30 days of the filing of respondent's report pursuant to Vaccine Rule 4(b). At this conference, after affording the parties an opportunity to address each other's positions, the special master will review the materials submitted, evaluate the respective positions, and orally present tentative findings and conclusions.

<p class="statutory-body">The special master shall conduct conferences from time to time in order to expedite the proc<!-- PDFPage:456 -->essing of the case. The conferences will be informal in nature and ordinarily will be conducted by telephone conference call. Either party may request a status conference at any time. At such conferences, counsel for both parties will have the opportunity to propose procedures by which to process the case in the least adversarial, most efficient way possible.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 7. Discovery.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be no discovery as a matter of right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Informal Discovery Preferred.</strong> The informal and cooperative exchange of information is the ordinary and preferred practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Formal Discovery.</strong> If a party considers that informal discovery is not sufficient, that party may seek to utilize the discovery procedures provided by RCFC 26&ndash;37 by filing a motion indicating the discovery sought and stating with particularity the reasons therefor, including an explanation why informal techniques have not been sufficient. Such a motion may also be made orally at a status conference.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Subpoena.</strong> When necessary, the special master upon request by a party may approve the issuance of a subpoena. In so doing, the procedures of RCFC 45 shall apply. See RCFC Appendix of Forms (Form 7A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Hearing.</strong> When necessary, the special master may conduct an evidentiary hearing. The special master will determine the format for such a hearing. The special master may permit direct examination of a witness or may permit or require that the direct testimony be submitted in written form. The special master may question a witness and may, on request, permit questioning by opposing counsel. Upon order by the special master, the clerk or counsel may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at such hearing. A transcript of the hearing shall be prepared in conformity with RCFC 80.1 and RCFC Appendix of Forms (Forms 3A and 3B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Evidence.</strong> In receiving evidence, the special master will not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence. The special master will consider all relevant, reliable evidence, governed by principles of fundamental fairness to both parties. Evidence may be taken in the form of documents, affidavits, or oral testimony, which may be given in person or via telephone, videoconference, or videotape. Sworn written testimony may be submitted in lieu of oral testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Decision Without Evidentiary Hearing.</strong> The special master may decide a case on the basis of written filings without an evidentiary hearing. In addition, the special master may decide a case on summary judgment, adopting procedures set forth in RCFC 56 modified to the needs of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Argument.</strong> Argument may be received by telephone conference call or at a hearing or in written submissions. The special master may establish requirements for such filings, <em>e.g.</em>, contents or page limitations, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Waiver of Argument.</strong> Any fact or argument not raised specifically in the record before the special master shall be considered waived and cannot be raised by either party in proceedings on review of a special master's decision. This rule shall not apply to legal arguments raised by the party that stands in the role of the appellee on review.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 9. Suspension of Proceedings.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> On the motion of a party, for good cause shown, the special master may suspend proceedings on the petition. The special master shall grant one such suspension for 30 days on the motion of either party. Further motions by either party for suspension may be granted, totaling not more than 150 additional days, in the special master's discretion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Effect.</strong> Such periods of suspension shall be excluded for purposes of the time limitations of 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;12(d)(3) and Vaccine Rules 4(b) and 10.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 10. Special Master's Decision.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> The special master shall issue a final decision determining whether or not an award of compensation shall be made and, if so, the amount thereof. This decision shall be filed within 240 days of the date on which the petition was filed, exclusive of periods of suspension pursuant to Vaccine Rule 9.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Certain Retrospective Cases.</strong> In cases in which the vaccination in question occurred prior to October 1, 1988, and in which the vaccine recipient is not deceased, the special master shall defer ruling on the limited issue of the amount of any compensation for lost earnings and pain and suffering, 42 U.S.C. &sect;300aa&ndash;15(a)(3) and (4), and combine that ruling with the decision under Vaccine Rule 13.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Reconsideration.</strong> Within 21 days of the issuance of the special master's decision, if neither a judgment nor a motion for review of the special master's decision has yet been filed, either party may file a motion for reconsideration of the special master's decision. The special master may seek the non-moving party's response to such a motion, determining the method of and time schedule for any such response. The special master will not rule in favor of such a motion without first requesting a response to it. The special master shall have discretion to grant or deny such motion, in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) If granted.</strong> If the special master elects to grant the motion for reconsideration, the special master shall do so by filing an order withdrawing the decision in question. The withdrawn decision then becomes void for all purposes, and the special master must subsequently enter a superseding decision. An order withdrawing the decision may be filed only if neither a judgment nor a motion for review has yet been filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) If not granted.</strong> The filing of a motion for reconsideration will not negate the running of the 30-day period for filing a motion for review of the special master's decision. If the special master denies such a motion, or during any period in which the special master has not yet <!-- PDFPage:457 -->acted upon such a motion, the 30-day period for the filing of a motion for review of the special master's decision shall continue to run and either side may file a motion for review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) In the Absence of Motion for Review.</strong> In the absence of the filing of a motion for review pursuant to Vaccine Rule 23 within 30 days of the filing of the special master's decision, or if prior to the expiration of such period each party files a notice stating that it will not seek such review, the clerk shall forthwith enter judgment in accordance with the special master's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Stipulation for Judgment.</strong> Any stipulation for a money judgment shall be signed by authorized representatives of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 17. Filing and Service of Papers After the Petition.</strong></p>

A document is filed when actually received and marked filed by the clerk, not when mailed. All matters shall be brought to the attention of the special master or the court through formal filings with the clerk rather than by correspondence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Service.</strong> A copy of every document filed by any party with the clerk shall be served on the opposing party's attorney, or the opposing unrepresented party if no appearance of attorney has been entered.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General.</strong> All filings with the clerk pursuant to the Vaccine Rules are to be made available <!-- PDFPage:458 -->only to the special master, judge, and parties, with the exception of certain court-produced documents as set forth in subdivision (b) of this rule. A transcript prepared pursuant to Vaccine Rule 8(b) shall be considered a filing for purposes of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Decisions of special masters and judges.</strong> When a decision of a special master or of the court is filed with the clerk, each party will be afforded 14 days in which to object to the public disclosure of any information furnished by that party&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> that are medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal may, in the discretion of the special master or the court, be deemed to operate as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a petitioner who has previously dismissed the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure to Prosecute or Participate.</strong> If petitioner fails to prosecute, the petition may be dismissed pursuant to Vaccine Rule 21(c). No judgment shall be entered against respondent despite any failure of participation unless petitioner introduces evidence establishing a right to compensation.</p>

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">PROCEDURE IN PROCUREMENT PROTEST CASES PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. &sect;1491(b)</h3>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">I. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>1.</strong> This Appendix describes standard practices in protest cases filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1491(b) and supplements the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims, which are otherwise fully applicable to these cases.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">II. REQUIREMENT FOR PRE-FILING NOTIFICATION</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>2.</strong> In order to expedite proceedings, prior to the filing of a protest case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1491(b), plaintiff's counsel shall (except in exceptional circumstances to be described in moving papers) provide at least 24-hours advance notice of filing the case to the:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(a)</strong> Department of Justice, Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division&mdash;(202) 514&ndash;7300;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b)</strong> Clerk, United States Court of Federal Claims&mdash;(202) 219&ndash;9657;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(c)</strong> procuring agency contracting officer by facsimile transmission, only; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(d)</strong> apparently successful bidder/offeror (in cases where there has been an award and the plaintiff has received notice of the identity of the awardee).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such notice shall be provided during conventional business hours. The pre-filing notice is intended to permit the Department of Justice to assign an attorney to the case who can be prepared to address relevant issues on a timely basis and to permit the court to insure the availability of appropriate court resources. Failure to provide pre-filing notification will not preclude the filing of the case, but is likely to delay the initial processing of the case including the scheduling of the initial status conference. See paragraph 8, below. Plaintiff's counsel shall apprise the above entities of any material change in respect to the timing of, or intent to file, a protest. Plaintiffs are encouraged to provide earlier notice if possible as a courtesy to the court and to government counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3.</strong> The pre-filing notice plaintiff provided pursuant to paragraph 2, above, should include the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(a)</strong> The name of the procuring agency and the number of the solicitation in the contested procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b)</strong> The name and telephone number of the contracting officer responsible for the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(c)</strong> Whether plaintiff contemplates requesting temporary or preliminary injunctive relief pursuant to RCFC 65;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(d)</strong> Whether the plaintiff has discussed the need for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief with Department of Justice counsel and the response, if any;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(e)</strong> Whether the action was preceded by the filing of a protest before the General Accounting Office (GAO) (if so, provide the &ldquo;B-&rdquo; number of the protest and indicate whether a decision was issued); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(f)</strong> Whether plaintiff contemplates the need for the court to enter a protective order.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">III. FILING UNDER SEAL</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>4.</strong> In the event plaintiff believes its complaint, or any pleadings filed at the same time, contain confidential or proprietary information and plaintiff seeks to protect that information from public scrutiny, plaintiff must file a motion for leave to file the complaint under seal, which shall be filed at the same time the complaint is filed. When a complaint or related papers are filed with an accompanying motion for leave to file under seal, the pleadings will be treated as though filed under seal while the motion is pending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>5.</strong> In filing documents under seal, a party shall follow the procedures described in RCFC 5.3(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>6.</strong> Complaints (and other pleadings filed at the same time) that are filed under seal shall be marked or highlighted in such a way that confidential or proprietary information is indicated and shall be accompanied by a redacted version of the pleading (a version that omits confidential or proprietary information), which will be available for public scrutiny. Failure to file the redacted copy may result in denial of the motion for leave to file under seal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>7.</strong> To the extent the complaint or any pleadings filed at the same time contain classified information, the filing must conform to the requirements of the classifying agency.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">IV. INITIAL STATUS CONFERENCE</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>8.</strong> The court will schedule an initial status conference with the parties to address relevant issues including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(a)</strong> Identification of interested parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b)</strong> In post-award cases, admission of the successful offeror as an intervenor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(c)</strong> Requests for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, if filed. See subdivision 15, below;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(d)</strong> The content of a protective order, if requested by one or more of the parties and the requirement for redacted copies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(e)</strong> The content and time for filing of the administrative record;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(f)</strong> Whether it may be appropriate to supplement the administrative record; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(g)</strong> The nature of and schedule for further proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This initial status conference will be held as soon as practicable after the filing of the complaint.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">V. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>9.</strong> The court's practice is to expedite protest cases to the extent practicable and to conduct <!-- PDFPage:461 -->hearings on motions for preliminary injunctions at the earliest practicable time. Accordingly, when a plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction, it may not need to request a temporary restraining order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>10.</strong> An application for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction shall be filed with the clerk along with the complaint, unless the complaint has been previously filed. The application shall be accompanied by affidavits, supporting memoranda, and other documents upon which plaintiff intends to rely. The application also shall be accompanied by a statement that plaintiff's counsel has hand delivered or provided for hand delivery, or transmitted by facsimile, copies of the foregoing documents to the Department of Justice, Commercial Litigation Branch, 8th Floor, 1100 L. St. N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>11.</strong> If the name of the apparently successful bidder/offeror is known (in cases where there has been an award and the plaintiff has received notice of the identity of the awardee), a copy of the foregoing documents shall be provided by hand, facsimile, or overnight delivery to the apparently successful bidder/offeror. The plaintiff shall state in its application whether the documents have been so provided. If the name of the awardee is unknown, the plaintiff shall so state.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>12.</strong> The apparently successful bidder/offeror may enter a notice of appearance at any hearing on the application for a temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction if it advises the court of its intention to move to intervene pursuant to RCFC 24(a)(2) or has moved to intervene before the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>13.</strong> The clerk will promptly inform the parties of the judge to whom the case has been assigned and the time and place of any hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>14.</strong> Except in an emergency, the court will not consider <em>ex parte</em> applications for a temporary restraining order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>15.</strong> In cases in which the plaintiff seeks temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, counsel should be prepared to discuss the following matters at the initial status conference:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(a)</strong> Whether and to what extent, absent temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, the court's ability to afford effective final relief is likely to be prejudiced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b)</strong> If a temporary restraining order has been requested, whether the plaintiff has discussed this request in advance with Department of Justice counsel and the response;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(c)</strong> If a temporary restraining order has been requested, whether the government will agree to withhold award or suspend performance pending a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(d)</strong> If a preliminary injunction has been requested, whether the government will agree to withhold award or suspend performance pending a final decision on the merits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(e)</strong> An appropriate schedule for completion of the briefing on any motion for a preliminary injunction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(f)</strong> The security requirements of RCFC 65(c) (See Appendix of Forms, Forms 11&ndash;13); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(g)</strong> Whether the hearing on the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with a final hearing on the merits.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">VI. PROTECTIVE ORDERS</h3>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>16. Preliminary Matters.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> The principal vehicle relied upon by the court to insure the protection of sensitive information is the protective order. The protective order defines the procedures to be followed to identify protected information, prepare redacted versions of such information, and dispose of protected information at the conclusion of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> Information a party identifies as protected may be disclosed only to parties who have been &ldquo;admitted&rdquo; to the protective order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> Once a protective order is issued by the court, individuals who seek access to protected information, must file an appropriate application. If admitted to the protective order, the individual becomes subject to the terms of the order. It is the responsibility of those admitted to the protective order to take the necessary steps to insure that the information is protected, consistent with the terms of the protective order, while it is under their control (this includes oversight of support personnel who may have access to protected information).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d)</strong> The court, procuring agency, and Department of Justice personnel are automatically admitted to protective orders when issued and are subject to their terms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>17. Issuance of a Protective Order</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> Motions for protective orders must meet the requirements of RCFC 10. The court may issue a protective order at its discretion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> A sample protective order is found at Appendix of Forms, Form 8. The parties are cautioned that individual judges and the parties themselves may want to amend the sample protective order to meet the needs of specific cases or their individual preferences. It is the specific protective order issued in a case that governs the treatment of protected information in that case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>18. Application for Admission to the Protective Order</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> Each party seeking access to protected information upon behalf of an individual must file with the court, an appropriate &ldquo;Application for Admission to the Protective Order.&rdquo; Separate applications for individual outside and in-house counsel, and for consultants or experts retained by counsel for a party, are contained in the Appendix of Forms (Forms 9 and 10). These forms may also be amended by the court in response to individual case needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> Admission to the protective order will be based upon the contents of the application form submitted by an individual representing a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> Objections to an Application for Admission to a protective order must be filed with the court within two days of a party's receipt of an application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d)</strong> In considering objections to Applications for Admission to a Protective Order, the court will consider such factors as the nature and sensitivity of the information at issue, a party's need for access to the data in order to effectively represent its client, the overall number of applications received and other concerns that may affect the risk of inadvertent disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e)</strong> Admission to a protective order will be made by the court in the form of an order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:462 --><p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>19. Designation of Protected Information and Preparation of Redacted Pleadings.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">After a protective order is entered the designation of protected information and the preparation and filing of redacted documents shall be governed by the terms of the protective order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>20. Disposition of Material Containing Protected Information.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body">The specific procedures to be followed in disposing of protected information at the conclusion of the case shall be as described in the protective order.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">VII. THE CONTENT AND FILING OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD</h3>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>21.</strong> The United States will be required to identify and provide (or make available for inspection) the administrative record in a protest case by the date(s) established at the initial status conference. The filing of all or a part of the administrative record shall be accompanied by a Notice of Filing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>22.</strong> Early production of relevant core documents may expedite final resolution of the case. The core documents relevant to a protest case may include, as appropriate the:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(a)</strong> agency's procurement request, purchase request, or statement of requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(b)</strong> agency's source selection plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(c)</strong> bid abstract or prospectus of bid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(d)</strong> Commerce Business Daily or other public announcement of the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(e)</strong> solicitation, including any instructions to offerors, evaluation factors, solicitation amendments, and requests for best and final offers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(f)</strong> documents and information provided to bidders during any pre-bid or pre-proposal conference;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(g)</strong> agency's responses to any questions about or requests for clarification of the solicitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(h)</strong> agency's estimates of the cost of performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(i)</strong> correspondence between the agency and the protester, awardee, or other interested parties relating to the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(j)</strong> records of any discussions, meetings, or telephone conferences between the agency and the protester, awardee, or other interested parties relating to the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(k)</strong> records of the results of any bid opening or oral motion auction in which the protester, awardee or other interested parties participated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(<em>l</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong>)</strong> protester's, awardee's, and other interested parties&rsquo; offers, proposals, or other responses to the solicitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(m)</strong> agency's competitive range determination, including supporting documentation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(n)</strong> agency's evaluations of the protester's, awardee's, or other interested parties&rsquo; offers, proposals or other responses to the solicitation, including supporting documentation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(<em>o</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong>)</strong> agency's source selection decision, including supporting documentation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(p)</strong> pre-award audits, if any, or surveys of the offerors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(q)</strong> notification of contract award and executed contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(r)</strong> documents relating to any pre- or post-award debriefing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(s)</strong> documents relating to any stay, suspension, or termination of award or performance pending resolution of the bid protest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(t)</strong> justifications, approvals, determinations and findings, if any, prepared for the procurement by the agency pursuant to statute or regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(u)</strong> the record of any previous administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the procurement, including the record of any other protest of the procurement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>23.</strong> Because a protest case cannot be efficiently processed until production of the administrative record, the court expects the United States to produce the core documents and the remainder of the administrative record as promptly as circumstances will permit. (See RCFC 5.3 (d) which is applicable to administrative records, unless waived by the court.) Materials that otherwise qualify as part of the administrative record are not excluded from it merely because they are only in electronic form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>24.</strong> Any additional documents within the administrative record shall be produced at such time as may be agreed to by the parties or ordered by the court.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">VIII. ADMISSION OF COUNSEL</h3>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>25.</strong> In those procurement protest cases in which counsel for the plaintiff is not a member of the bar of the court and does not have sufficient time to gain admission prior to the filing of the action, the clerk shall accept for filing any proper complaint and accompanying pleadings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1491(b) from such counsel, conditioned upon counsel's prompt pursuit of admission to practice before the United States Court of Federal Claims pursuant to RCFC 83.1. Failure to do so within 30 days of the initiation of the action may result in dismissal of the action, and possible referral for disciplinary action.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">This appendix sets forth the procedures applicable to the court's procurement protest jurisdiction. In the main, these procedures reflect those that formerly appeared as General Order No. 38, issued on May 7, 1998. In addition, however, Appendix C now also incorporates&mdash;in paragraphs 10 through 14&mdash;those provisions of former RCFC 65(f) (titled &ldquo;Procedures&rdquo;) which enumerated requirements particular to applications for temporary restraining orders and/or motions for preliminary injunction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Papers and exhibits are often filed under seal in procurement protests. Procedures for unsealing are addressed at RCFC 77.3(d). The standards for granting access to protected information are addressed in decisions such as <em>U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States</em>, 730 F.2d 1465 (Fed. Cir. 1984) and <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States</em>, 929 F.2d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>

<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">PROCEDURE IN CONGRESSIONAL REFERENCE CASES</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>1. Purpose.</strong> The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, amended 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1492 and 2509 to authorize either House of Congress to refer bills to the chief judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims for investigation and report to <!-- PDFPage:463 -->the appropriate House. Procedures promulgated by the chief judge applicable to such congressional reference cases are specified herein. The RCFC, to the extent feasible, are to be applied in congressional reference cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>2. Service of notice.</strong> Upon referral of a bill to the chief judge by either House of the Congress, the clerk shall docket the reference and serve a notice, as provided in RCFC 5, on each person whose name and address is shown by the papers transmitted and who appears to have an interest in the subject matter of the reference. The notice shall set forth the filing of the reference and state that the person notified appears to have an interest therein and that such person shall have 90 days within which to file a complaint. The clerk shall forward a copy of each such notice to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3. Complaint.</strong> Any person served with notice who desires to assert a claim may do so by filing a complaint in accordance with RCFC</p>
5.3(d), 8 and 9.<p class="statutory-body"><strong>4. Failure of party to appear.</strong> If no interested person files a complaint within the time specified in the notice served by the clerk, the case may be reported upon the papers filed and upon such evidence, if any, as may be produced by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>5. Hearing officer; review panel.</strong> Upon the filing of a complaint, the chief judge by order will designate a judge of the court to serve as hearing officer and a panel of three judges to serve as a reviewing body. One of the review panel members will be designated by the chief judge as presiding officer of the panel. Each hearing officer and each review panel, acting by majority vote, shall have authority to do and perform any acts which may be necessary or proper for the efficient performance of their duties, including the power of subpoena and the power to administer oaths and affirmations. Subpoenas requiring travel of more than 100 miles to place of trial must have attached thereto an order of approval by the hearing officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>6. Hearing officer report.</strong> The hearing officer shall conduct such proceedings and utilize such rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims as may be required to determine the facts, including facts relating to delay or laches, facts bearing upon the question whether the bar of any statute of limitation should be removed, or facts claimed to excuse the claimant for not having resorted to any established legal remedy. The hearing officer shall find the facts specially. The hearing officer shall append to the findings of fact conclusions sufficient to inform Congress whether the demand is a legal or equitable claim or a gratuity, and the amount, if any, legally or equitably due from the United States to the claimant. The report shall be filed with the clerk, and served by the clerk on the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>7. Acceptance or exceptions.</strong> Within 30 days after service of the report, each party shall file either (a) a notice of intention to except to the report or (b) a notice accepting the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>8. Review panel consideration and report.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> The findings and conclusions of the hearing officer, together with the record of the case, shall be transmitted to the review panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> When a party or parties have filed a notice of intention to except, the presiding officer by order shall establish a schedule for the parties to file briefs on exceptions to the hearing officer's findings and conclusions and requests for oral argument before the panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> When neither party has filed a notice of intention to except, the review panel shall nevertheless review the report. If the review panel is considering a material modification of the findings or conclusions of the hearing officer, the presiding officer by order shall so notify the parties and shall establish a schedule for the parties to file briefs and requests for oral argument before the panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d)</strong> The hearing officer's findings shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the hearing officer to judge the credibility of witnesses. The hearing officer's conclusions shall not be set aside unless justice shall so require. No case shall be returned to the hearing officer unless so ordered by the review panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e)</strong> After conclusion of its review, including any briefing and argument, the review panel, by majority vote, shall adopt or modify the findings and the conclusions of the hearing officer and shall file its report with the clerk, for service on the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>9. Rehearing.</strong> Within 10 days after service of the report of the review panel, any party may file a motion for rehearing to alter or amend the report. The motion shall state with particularity any contention of law or fact which the movant believes has been overlooked or misapprehended, and shall contain argument in support thereof. Oral argument in support of the motion shall not be permitted. No response to a motion for rehearing is required, but will be considered if filed within 10 days from the date the motion for rehearing is served. No time extension shall be allowed for filing such a response. If the motion for rehearing is granted, the review panel shall take such further action as in its discretion may be required by the circumstances of the particular case. The chief judge will entertain no appeals or requests for review of any rulings or actions by a hearing officer or a review panel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>10. Transmittal to Congress.</strong> When all proceedings are concluded, the report of the review panel shall be transmitted by the chief judge to the appropriate House of Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>11. Admission to practice.</strong> Any attorney representing a claimant in a congressional reference case may file and appear as attorney of record in the proceeding if such attorney is a member of the bar of the United States Court of Federal Claims or, if not, upon certification to the clerk that such attorney is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any state in the Union or the District of Columbia. Any claimant, except a corporation, in a congressional reference case may proceed <em>pro se</em>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>12. Filing Fees.</strong> Filing fees as set by RCFC 77.1 are required in congressional reference cases.</p>

<p class="note-body">Appendix D provides the procedures applicable to congressional reference cases. Revisions effective May 1, 2002 include the deletion from former &nbsp;3 of authority for the filing of a &ldquo;preliminary complaint&rdquo; (a change <!-- PDFPage:464 -->that reflects the corresponding deletion of such authority from the court's basic rules) and the deletion, as unnecessary, of former &nbsp;6, titled &ldquo;Captions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Revisions effective September 15, 2003, reorganize &nbsp;8 (former &nbsp;9) into five subparagraphs. Subparagraph (c) clarifies the review panel's responsibility in the absence of exceptions to a hearing officer's report and identifies the procedures required where modification of such a report is being considered by the review panel. Subparagraph (d) sets out standards for review applicable whether or not exceptions have been taken, including language formerly appearing in &nbsp;7. The restriction on the role of the chief judge in the appeal and review process has been relocated to the end of &nbsp;9.</p>

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">PROCEDURE IN CARRIER CASES</h3>
<p class="statutory-body-block"><strong>Rule 1. Carrier's Request For Admission of Facts</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Time for Filing Request.</strong> In every suit filed by a carrier for the recovery of freight and/or passenger transportation charges, the carrier shall, at the time the complaint is filed or within 30 days thereafter, file with the clerk a request for admission by the defendant of the genuineness of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request and of the truth of the material matters of fact relied on by the carrier for recovery in the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Form and Content of Request.</strong> The request shall conform to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Duplication.</strong> The request, with accompanying schedules and documents, may be typewritten, or may be printed, or otherwise mechanically reproduced from a typewritten original, provided that all copies filed with the clerk shall be legible and that the words and figures shown therein shall be large enough type to be read without difficulty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Copies; Filing; Service.</strong> If the request accompanies the complaint, copies and service of such request shall be as provided in RCFC 3(c) and 4. If the request is filed subsequent to the filing of the complaint, copies and service of such request shall be as provided in RCFC 5, and 83, except that 5 copies shall be served on the defendant in lieu of a copy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Signature of Attorney.</strong> The request shall be signed by the attorney of record for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6) Nature of Dispute; Statement of Issues.</strong> The statement in the request shall be sufficiently explicit to show the nature of the dispute and the specific reason or reasons why the plaintiff believes it is entitled to recover higher rates or charges than those allowed by the government.

In order to show the nature of the dispute there shall be attached to or included in plaintiff's request a statement of the issues which, with respect to each group of the carrier's bills involving the same issue, shall consist of a brief narrative statement of such issue with a reference to (A) court decisions involving the same issue, or (B) the tariffs, contract terms or other authority relied upon by plaintiff, and the tariffs or other authority which plaintiff believes defendant relied upon in making deductions for claimed overpayments to the carrier or in refusing to pay the carrier's supplemental bills for claimed undercharges.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Appendix E formerly appeared in these rules as Appendix C. Additionally, substantive changes have been made:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the word &ldquo;common&rdquo; has been stricken from the term &ldquo;common carrier.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; is no longer used in the Interstate Commerce Act 49 U.S.C. &sect;13102. Since deregulation occurred, <em>see</em> ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104&ndash;88, &sect;103, 109 Stat. 803, 852, carriers are no longer required to file tariffs other than for household goods and noncontiguous domestic trade. Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity are no longer required and thus there are no &ldquo;common carriers,&rdquo; as the term formerly was used, as a reference to a public utility, fully regulated status.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, in subdivision (a)(2)(F), titled &ldquo;Nature of Dispute; Statement of Issues&rdquo; the term &ldquo;General Accounting Office&rdquo; was replaced with &ldquo;General Services Administration.&rdquo; The GSA Board of Contract Appeals replaced the General Accounting Office as reviewing authority in GSA transportation audit billing appeals pursuant to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1996, effective June 30, 1996, and delegations of authority granted thereunder. Also, in subdivision (a)(2)(F)(2), the term &ldquo;contract terms&rdquo; was added as authority relied upon by plaintiffs in their statement of issues because, with no tariff filing requirement, individual movements by contract are more common.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, all references to a &ldquo;&sect;22 quotation&rdquo; were replaced with &ldquo;government rate quotation.&rdquo; Section 22 (49 U.S.C. &sect;22 (1887)) rates were replaced by &ldquo;government rates&rdquo; under 49 U.S.C. &sect;10721 (rail) and &sect;13712 (all other modes), and as such, lower rates are not limited strictly for the use of the government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, in subdivision (a)(2)(I)(ii)(a), the word &ldquo;government&rdquo; was struck in reference to a transportation request or warrant in dispute. Under the provisions of 41 CFR &sect;102&ndash;118.175, Government Bills of Lading will no longer be used for domestic traffic and under 41 CFR &sect;102&ndash;118.180, Government Transportation Requests will no longer be mandatory.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fifth, in subdivision (b)(9), titled, &ldquo;Relation to Pleadings, Time for Filing Answer or Counterclaim,&rdquo; the statutory reference was updated.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:468 --><p class="note-body">Finally, all references to the &ldquo;Interstate Commerce Commission&rdquo; were stricken and replaced with the &ldquo;Surface Transportation Board.&rdquo; While carriers are no longer subject to full regulation, the &ldquo;reasonableness requirement&rdquo; on &ldquo;through routes,&rdquo; &ldquo;divisions of joint rates,&rdquo; and rates &ldquo;made collectively by [any group of] carriers under agreements approved by the Surface Transportation Board,&rdquo; remains intact and is subject to that body's review.</p>

<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">PROCEDURE FOR ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>1. General.</strong> The United States Court of Federal Claims recognizes a variety of voluntary, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) tools for use in appropriate cases. ADR techniques include but are not limited to mediation, mini-trials, early neutral evaluation, and non-binding arbitration. These processes may be conducted either by a settlement judge or a third party neutral.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>2. Terms.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Settlement Judge:</strong> A judge of the court, other than the presiding judge. Appointment of a settlement judge permits the parties to engage in a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's case before a judicial officer without the inhibitions that might exist before the presiding judge. A settlement judge may act both as a mediator and as a neutral evaluator. This process should be employed early enough in the litigation to avoid needless expense and delay. Use of a settlement judge permits the parties to gain the benefit of a judicial perspective without jeopardizing their ability to gain a resolution of their case by the presiding judge should settlement efforts fail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Presiding Judge.</strong> The judge regularly assigned to the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Third-party Neutrals.</strong> In consultation with the bar, the court will maintain a list of qualified individuals who have indicated their willingness and demonstrated their ability to serve as neutral evaluators and mediators. Parties may select neutrals who are not on the court's list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Mediation.</strong> A flexible and voluntary dispute-resolution procedure in which a settlement judge or a third-party neutral, the mediator, facilitates negotiations to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. The mediation process involves one or more sessions in which counsel, litigants, and the mediator participate, and may continue over a period of time. The mediator can help the parties improve communication, clarify interests, and probe the strengths and weaknesses of their own and their opponents&rsquo; positions. The mediator can also identify areas of agreement and help generate options that lead to a settlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Early neutral evaluation.</strong> Using the services of a third-party neutral or settlement judge knowledgeable in the subject-matter of the litigation to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the parties&rsquo; positions. In this manner, the parties may gain a more realistic view of their prospects for success, thus narrowing the issues and facilitating settlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Mini-trials.</strong> A flexible, abbreviated procedure in which the parties present their case, or a portion of it, to a third-party neutral or settlement judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>3. Procedures.</strong> RCFC 16 and Appendix A paragraphs 3 and 4(i) set out the parties&rsquo; obligations with respect to consideration of ADR. At any point in the litigation, however, the parties can notify the court of their desire to pursue ADR. There is no single format for ADR. Any procedures agreed to by the parties and adopted by the settlement judge or third party neutral may be used. Certain basic ground rules will be observed, however, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> ADR is voluntary. A party's good faith determination that ADR is not appropriate in a particular case should be respected by other parties and the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> When the parties have indicated their agreement to ADR to the presiding judge, the presiding judge, if in agreement, will forward the request to the Clerk of the Court for assignment to a settlement judge or third-party neutral as selected by the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c)</strong> In the event the parties agree to use ADR, the settlement judge or third party neutral and the parties will develop procedures appropriate <!-- PDFPage:473 -->to that case. The settlement judge or third-party neutral and the parties will develop a written statement, to be executed by the settlement judge or neutral, outlining the terms of the settlement process, including an indication of assent to confidentiality by all parties. Neither this statement nor any other materials developed for use solely within the ADR process will be filed with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d)</strong> There will be no transcript of any ADR proceeding. All ADR proceedings, including documents generated solely for the proceedings and communications within the scope of the proceedings, are confidential and will not be provided to a judge of the court who is not the settlement judge in the dispute. Information which is otherwise discoverable or admissible does not lose that characteristic merely because of its use in the ADR proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e)</strong> Participation in ADR constitutes agreement by the parties not to subpoena or seek in any way the testimony of the settlement judge in any subsequent proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f)</strong> During the ADR process, the matter will remain on the docket of the presiding judge. At the conclusion of the ADR process, the settlement judge or the third party neutral will notify the presiding judge and the clerk of the court only of the outcome, i.e., whether the matter has been settled.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Appendix H &ldquo;Procedure For Alternate Dispute Resolution,&rdquo; revises and replaces the alternate dispute resolution procedures first adopted by the court in General Order No. 13, dated April 15, 1987 and later amended through Amended General Order No. 13, dated November 8, 1996. The adoption of Appendix H as a permanent part of the court's rules reflects the court's recognition of the increasing usefulness of alternative dispute resolution procedures in the resolution of claims against the United States.</p>
