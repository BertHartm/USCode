<h3 class="section-head">Rule 77. Court and Clerk</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Court Always Open.</strong> The court shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing any pleading or other proper paper, of issuing and returning process, and of making and directing all interlocutory motions, orders, and rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Trials and Hearings; Proceedings in Chambers.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Proceedings Generally.</strong> All trials upon the merits shall be conducted in open court and so far as convenient in a regular courtroom. All other acts or proceedings may be done or conducted by a judge in chambers, without the attendance of the clerk or other court officials or at any other place designated by order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Trials or Hearings in Foreign Countries.</strong> Upon motion of a party or upon the judge's own initiative, and upon a determination by the judge to whom the case is assigned that the interests of economy, efficiency, and justice will be served, the chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims may issue an order authorizing a judge of the court to conduct proceedings, including evidentiary hearings and trials, in a foreign country whose laws do not prohibit such proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Clerk's Office and Orders by Clerk.</strong> The clerk's office, with the clerk or a deputy in attendance, shall be open during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and the following holidays: New Year's Day, Inauguration Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and any other day designated as a holiday by the President or the Congress of the United States. All motions and applications in the clerk's office for issuing process, process to enforce and execute judgments, for entering defaults or judgments by default, and for other proceedings which do not require allowance or order of the court are grantable of course by the clerk; but the clerk's action may be suspended or altered or rescinded by the court upon cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Notice of Orders or Judgments.</strong> Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice of the entry in the manner provided for in RCFC 5 upon each party who is not in default for failure to appear and shall make a note in the docket of the service. Any party may in addition serve a notice of such entry in the manner provided in RCFC 5 for the service of papers. Lack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in Rule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">To more closely parallel the structure and content of FRCP 77, RCFC 77 has been modified as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivisions (a) (referring to the court's &ldquo;Name&rdquo;), (b) (referring to the court's &ldquo;Seal&rdquo;), (d) (captioned &ldquo;Citations&rdquo;), and (e) (identifying the court's judicial power as being exercisable by a single judge, except in congressional reference cases), have been deleted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) (formerly subdivision (h) of this rule) has been changed in two respects. First, in order better to reflect its content, the subdivision has been retitled to read &ldquo;Trials and Hearings; Proceedings in Chambers&rdquo; (in lieu of &ldquo;Trials and Hearings; Orders in Chambers&rdquo;). Second, the subdivision has been divided into paragraphs (1) and (2). Paragraph (1), captioned &ldquo;Proceedings Generally,&rdquo; retains the rule's earlier language; paragraph (2), captioned &ldquo;Trials or Hearings in Foreign Countries,&rdquo; has been added to recognize the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. &sect;798(b) to conduct trials or hearings in foreign countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (f), titled &ldquo;Assignment of Cases,&rdquo; was renumbered as RCFC 40.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (g), titled &ldquo;Signing of Orders for Absent Judges,&rdquo; was renumbered as RCFC 77.2(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivisions (<em>l</em>) and (k), titled, respectively, &ldquo;Scheduling Courtrooms&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fee Schedule,&rdquo; were renumbered as RCFC 77.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, former subdivision (m) was deleted in order to recognize the right of certain court employees to participate in <em>pro bono</em> legal work under the guidelines prescribed for that purpose by the Codes of Conduct for Judicial Employees.</p>
