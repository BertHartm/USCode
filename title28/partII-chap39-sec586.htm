<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">based on such maximum annual compensation and the actual, necessary expenses incurred by such individual as standing trustee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such individual shall collect such percentage fee from all payments received by such individual under plans in the cases under chapter 12 or 13 of title 11 for which such individual serves as standing trustee. Such individual shall pay to the United States trustee, and the United States trustee shall deposit in the United States Trustee System Fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any amount by which the actual compensation of such individual exceeds 5 per centum upon all payments received under plans in cases under chapter 12 or 13 of title 11 for which such individual serves as standing trustee; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After first exhausting all available administrative remedies, an individual appointed under subsection (b) may obtain judicial review of final agency action to deny a claim of actual, necessary expenses under this subsection by commencing an action in the district court of the United States for the district where the individual resides. The decision of the agency shall be affirmed by the district court unless it is unreasonable and without cause based upon the administrative record before the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Attorney General shall prescribe procedures to implement this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The United States trustee for each district is authorized to contract with auditors to <!-- PDFPage:229 -->perform audits in cases designated by the United States trustee, in accordance with the procedures established under section 603(a) of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.</p>

Each report shall clearly and conspicuously specify any material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets identified by the person performing the audit. In any case in which a material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets has been reported, the clerk of the district court (or the clerk of the bankruptcy court if one is certified under section 156(b) of this title) shall give notice of the misstatement to the creditors in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a material misstatement of income or expenditures or of assets is reported, the United States trustee shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) report the material misstatement, if appropriate, to the United States Attorney pursuant to section 3057 of title 18; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if advisable, take appropriate action, including but not limited to commencing an adversary proceeding to revoke the debtor's discharge pursuant to section 727(d) of title 11.</p>
