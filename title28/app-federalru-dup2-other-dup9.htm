<p class="statutory-body">In this article:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) A &ldquo;writing&rdquo; consists of letters, words, numbers, or their equivalent set down in any form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) A &ldquo;recording&rdquo; consists of letters, words, numbers, or their equivalent recorded in any manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) A &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; means a photographic image or its equivalent stored in any form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) An &ldquo;original&rdquo; of a writing or recording means the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by the person who executed or issued it. For electronically stored information, &ldquo;original&rdquo; means any printout&mdash;or other output readable by sight&mdash;if it accurately reflects the information. An &ldquo;original&rdquo; of a photograph includes the negative or a print from it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) A &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; means a counterpart produced by a mechanical, photographic, chemical, electronic, or other equivalent process or technique that accurately reproduces the original.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">In an earlier day, when discovery and other related procedures were strictly limited, the misleading named &ldquo;best evidence rule&rdquo; afforded substantial guarantees against inaccuracies and fraud by its insistence upon production of original documents. The great enlargement of the scope of discovery and related procedures in recent times has measurably reduced the need for the rule. Nevertheless important areas of usefulness persist: discovery of documents outside the jurisdiction may require substantial outlay of time and money; the unanticipated document may not practically be discoverable; criminal cases have built-in limitations on discovery. Cleary and Strong, The Best Evidence Rule: An Evaluation in Context, 51 Iowa L.Rev. 825 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. Traditionally the rule requiring the original centered upon accumulations of data and expressions affecting legal relations set forth in words and figures. This meant that the rule was one essentially related to writings. Present day techniques have expanded methods of storing data, yet the essential form which the information ultimately assumes for usable purposes is words and figures. Hence the considerations underlying the rule dictate its expansion to include computers, photographic systems, and other modern developments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3)</em>. In most instances, what is an original will be self-evident and further refinement will be unnecessary. However, in some instances particularized definition is required. A carbon copy of a contract executed in duplicate becomes an original, as does a sales ticket carbon copy given to a customer. While strictly speaking the original of a photograph might be thought to be only the negative, practicality and common usage require that any print from the negative be regarded as an original. Similarly, practicality and usage confer the status of original upon any computer printout. <em>Transport Indemnity Co. v. Seib</em>, 178 Neb. 253, 132 N.W.2d 871 (1965).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em>. The definition describes &ldquo;copies&rdquo; produced by methods possessing an accuracy which virtually eliminates the possibility of error. Copies thus produced are given the status of originals in large measure by Rule 1003, <em>infra</em>. Copies subsequently produced manually, whether handwritten or typed, are not within the definition. It should be noted that what is an original for some purposes may be a duplicate for others. Thus a bank's microfilm record of checks cleared is the original as a record. However, a print offered as a copy of a check whose contents are in controversy is a duplicate. This result is substantially consistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1732(b). Compare 26 U.S.C. &sect;7513(c), giving full status as originals to photographic reproductions of tax returns and other documents, made by authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, and 44 U.S.C. &sect;399(a), giving original status to photographic copies in the National Archives.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 1002. Requirement of the Original</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:sourcecredit -->
<p class="source-credit">(Pub. L. 93&ndash;595, &sect;1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1946; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is the familiar one requiring production of the original of a document to prove its contents, expanded to include writings, recordings, and photographs, as defined in Rule 1001(1) and (2), <em>supra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Application of the rule requires a resolution of the question whether contents are sought to be proved. Thus an event may be proved by nondocumentary evidence, even though a written record of it was made. If, however, the event is sought to be proved by the written record, the rule applies. For example, payment may be proved without producing the written receipt which was given. Earnings may be proved without producing books of account in which they are entered. McCormick &sect;198; 4 Wigmore &sect;1245. Nor does the rule apply to testimony that books or records have been examined and found not to contain any reference to a designated matter.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assumption should not be made that the rule will come into operation on every occasion when use is made of a photograph in evidence. On the contrary, the rule will seldom apply to ordinary photographs. In most instances a party <em>wishes</em> to introduce the item and the question raised is the propriety of receiving it in evidence. Cases in which an offer is made of the testimony of a witness as to what he saw in a photograph or motion picture, without producing the same, are most unusual. The usual course is for a witness on the stand to identify the photograph or motion picture as a correct representation of events which he saw or of a scene with which he is familiar. In fact he adopts the picture as his testimony, or, in common parlance, uses the picture to illustrate his testimony. Under these circumstances, no effort is made to prove the contents of the picture, and the rule is inapplicable. Paradis, The Celluloid Witness, 37 U.Colo.L. Rev. 235, 249&ndash;251 (1965).</p>
<p class="note-body">On occasion, however, situations arise in which contents are sought to be proved. Copyright, defamation, and invasion of privacy by photograph or motion picture falls in this category. Similarly as to situations in which the picture is offered as having independent probative value, e.g. automatic photograph of bank robber. See <em>People v. Doggett</em>, 83 Cal.App.2d 405, 188 P.2d 792 (1948) photograph of defendants engaged in indecent act; Mouser and Philbin, Photographic Evidence&mdash;Is There a Recognized Basis for Admissibility? 8 Hastings L.J. 310 (1957). The most commonly encountered of this latter group is of course, the X-ray, with substantial authority calling for production of the original. <em>Daniels v. Iowa City</em>, 191 Iowa 811, 183 N.W. 415 (1921); <em>Cellamare v. Third Acc. Transit Corp</em>., 273 App.Div. 260, 77 N.Y.S.2d 91 (1948); <em>Patrick & Tilman v. Matkin</em>, 154 Okl. 232, 7 P.2d 414 (1932); <em>Mendoza v. Rivera</em>, 78 P.R.R. 569 (1955)</p>
<p class="note-body">It should be noted, however, that Rule 703, supra, allows an expert to give an opinion based on matters not in evidence, and the present rule must be read as being limited accordingly in its application. Hospital records which may be admitted as business records under Rule 803(6) commonly contain reports interpreting X-rays by the staff radiologist, who qualifies as an expert, and these reports need not be excluded from the records by the instant rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to Acts of Congress is made in view of such statutory provisions as 26 U.S.C. &sect;7513, photographic reproductions of tax returns and documents, made by authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, treated as originals, and 44 U.S.C. &sect;399(a), photographic copies in National Archives treated as originals.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless a genuine question is raised about the original's authenticity or the circumstances make it unfair to admit the duplicate.</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->

<p class="note-body">When the only concern is with getting the words or other contents before the court with accuracy and precision, then a counterpart serves equally as well as the original, if the counterpart is the product of a method which insures accuracy and genuineness. By definition in Rule 1001(4), <em>supra</em>, a &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; possesses this character.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, if no genuine issue exists as to authenticity and no other reason exists for requiring the original, a duplicate is admissible under the rule. This position finds support in the decisions, <em>Myrick v. United States</em>, 332 F.2d 279 (5th Cir. 1964), no error in admitting photostatic copies of checks instead of original microfilm in absence of suggestion to trial judge that photostats were incorrect; <em>Johns v. United States</em>, 323 F.2d 421 (5th Cir. 1963), not error to admit concededly accurate tape recording made from original wire recording; <em>Sauget v. Johnston</em>, 315 F.2d 816 (9th Cir. 1963), not error to admit copy of agreement when opponent had original and did not on appeal claim any discrepancy. Other reasons for requiring the original may be present when only a part of the original is reproduced and the remainder is needed for cross-examination or may disclose matters qualifying the part offered or otherwise useful to the opposing party. <em>United States v. Alexander</em>, 326 F.2d 736 (4th Cir. 1964). And see <em>Toho Bussan Kaisha, Ltd. v. American President Lines, Ltd</em>., 265 F.2d 418, 76 A.L.R.2d 1344 (2d Cir. 1959).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) all the originals are lost or destroyed, and not by the proponent acting in bad faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) an original cannot be obtained by any available judicial process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) the party against whom the original would be offered had control of the original; was at that time put on notice, by pleadings or otherwise, that the original would be a subject of proof at the trial or hearing; and fails to produce it at the trial or hearing; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) the writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">Basically the rule requiring the production of the original as proof of contents has developed as a rule of preference: if failure to produce the original is satisfactory explained, secondary evidence is admissible. The instant rule specifies the circumstances under which production of the original is excused.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule recognizes no &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; of secondary evidence. While strict logic might call for extending the principle of preference beyond simply preferring the original, the formulation of a hierarchy of preferences and a procedure for making it effective is believed to involve unwarranted complexities. Most, if not all, that would be accomplished by an extended scheme of preferences will, in any event, be achieved through the normal motivation of a party to present the most convincing evidence possible and the arguments and procedures available to his opponent if he does not. Compare McCormick &sect;207.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em>. Loss or destruction of the original, unless due to bad faith of the proponent, is a satisfactory explanation of nonproduction. McCormick &sect;201.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em>. When the original is in the possession of a third person, inability to procure it from him by resort to process or other judicial procedure is sufficient explanation of nonproduction. Judicial procedure includes subpoena duces tecum as an incident to the taking of a deposition in another jurisdiction. No further showing is required. See McCormick &sect;202.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3)</em>. A party who has an original in his control has no need for the protection of the rule if put on notice that proof of contents will be made. He can ward off secondary evidence by offering the original. The notice procedure here provided is not to be confused with orders to produce or other discovery procedures, as the purpose of the procedure under this rule is to afford the opposite party an opportunity to produce the original, not to compel him to do so. McCormick &sect;203.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em>. While difficult to define with precision, situations arise in which no good purpose is served by production of the original. Examples are the newspaper in an action for the price of publishing defendant's advertisement, <em>Foster-Holcomb Investment Co. v. Little Rock Publishing Co</em>., 151 Ark. 449, 236 S.W. 597 (1922), and the streetcar transfer of plaintiff claiming status as a passenger, <em>Chicago City Ry. Co. v. Carroll</em>, 206 Ill. 318, 68 N.E. 1087 (1903). Numerous cases are collected in McCormick &sect;200, p. 412, n. 1.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Committee approved Rule 1004(1) in the form submitted to Congress. However, the Committee intends that loss or destruction of an original by another person at the instigation of the proponent should be considered as tantamount to loss or destruction in bad faith by the proponent himself.</p>

<p class="note-body">Public records call for somewhat different treatment. Removing them from their usual place of keeping would be attended by serious inconvenience to the public and to the custodian. As a consequence judicial decisions and statutes commonly hold that no explanation need be given for failure to produce the original of a public record. McCormick &sect;204; 4 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1215&ndash;1228. This blanket dispensation from producing or accounting for the original would open the door to the introduction of every kind of secondary evidence of contents of public records were it not for the preference given certified or compared copies. Recognition of degrees of secondary evidence in this situation is an appropriate <em>quid pro quo</em> for not applying the requirement of producing the original.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1733(b) apply only to departments or agencies of the United States. The rule, however, applies to public records generally and is comparable in scope in this respect to Rule 44(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p class="note-body">While the parent case, <em>Slatterie v. Pooley</em>, 6 M. & W. 664, 151 Eng. Rep. 579 (Exch. 1840), allows proof of contents by evidence of an oral admission by the party against whom offered, without accounting for nonproduction of the original, the risk of inaccuracy is substantial and the decision is at odds with the purpose of the rule giving preference to the original. See 4 Wigmore &sect;1255. The instant rule follows Professor McCormick's suggestion of limiting this use of admissions to those made in the course of giving testimony or in writing. McCormick &sect;208, p. 424. The limitation, of course, does not call for excluding evidence of an oral admission when nonproduction of the original has been accounted for and secondary evidence generally has become admissible. Rule 1004, <em>supra.</em></p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 1008. Functions of the Court and Jury</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Ordinarily, the court determines whether the proponent has fulfilled the factual conditions for admitting other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or photograph under Rule 1004 or 1005. But in a jury trial, the jury determines&mdash;in accordance with Rule 104(b)&mdash;any issue about whether:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) an asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) another one produced at the trial or hearing is the original; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) other evidence of content accurately reflects the content.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">Most preliminary questions of fact in connection with applying the rule preferring the original as evidence of contents are for the judge, under the general principles announced in Rule 104, <em>supra</em>. Thus, the question whether the loss of the originals has been established, or of the fulfillment of other conditions specified in Rule 1004, <em>supra</em>, is for the judge. However, questions may arise which go beyond the mere administration of the rule preferring the original and into the merits of the controversy. For example, plaintiff offers secondary evidence of the contents of an alleged contract, after first introducing evidence of loss of the original, and defendant counters with evidence that no such contract was ever executed. If the judge decides that the contract was never executed and excludes the secondary evidence, the case is at an end without ever going to the jury on a central issue. Levin, Authentication and Content of Writings, 10 Rutgers L.Rev. 632, 644 (1956). The latter portion of the instant rule is designed to insure treatment of these situations as raising jury questions. The decision is not one for uncontrolled discretion of the jury but is subject to the control exercised generally by the judge over jury determinations. See Rule 104(b), <em>supra.</em></p>
