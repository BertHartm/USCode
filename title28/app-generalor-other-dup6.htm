<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Definition; Form.</strong> &ldquo;Judgment&rdquo; as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties.</strong> When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Demand for Judgment.</strong> A judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment. Except as to a party against whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party's pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Costs; Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Costs Other than Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</strong> Costs other than attorneys&rsquo; fees may be awarded to the prevailing party to the extent permitted by law. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A) Filing Bill of Costs.</strong> A prevailing party may request the clerk to tax allowable costs by filing a Bill of Costs as set forth in the Appendix of Forms (Form 4) within 30 days <!-- PDFPage:442 -->after the date of final judgment, as defined in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(d)(2)(G). In any case where any costs other than the fee for filing the action are being requested, the bill of costs shall be supported by affidavit and accompanied by a memorandum setting forth the grounds and authorities supporting the request. Any vouchers, receipts or invoices supporting the cost being requested shall be attached as exhibits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B) Objections to Bill of Costs.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(i)</strong> An adverse party may object to the Bill of Costs or to any item claimed therein by filing objections within 28 days after the service of the Bill of Costs. Within 7 days after service of the objections, the prevailing party may file a reply. Unless a conference is scheduled by the clerk, the taxation of costs or any disallowance will be made by the clerk on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ii)</strong> A party may request the court to review the clerk's action by filing a motion within 14 days after action by the clerk. The court's review of the clerk's action will be made on the existing record unless otherwise ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C) Costs in Settlements.</strong> The clerk will not tax costs on any action terminated by settlement wherein the judgment is entered pursuant to RCFC 68 or is dismissed pursuant to RCFC 41(a). Settlement agreements must resolve any issue relating to costs. In the absence of special agreement, parties will bear their own costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D) No Extensions.</strong> No extensions of time under this rule will be permitted and the failure of a prevailing party to timely file a Bill of Costs shall constitute a waiver of any claim for costs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> Claims for attorneys&rsquo; fees and related nontaxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the substantive law governing the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be proved at trial. See Appendix of Forms, Form 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court, the motion must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of final judgment, as defined in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412(d)(2)(G); must specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the moving party to the award; and must state the amount sought. If directed by the court, the motion shall also disclose the terms of any agreement with respect to fees to be paid for the services for which claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> The court may determine issues of liability for fees before receiving submissions bearing on issues of evaluation of services for which liability is imposed by the court. The court shall find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in RCFC 52(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> The responding party shall have 28 days after service of the motion pursuant to subdivision (d)(2)(A) to file a response, to which plaintiff may reply within 14 days after service of the response. After the filing of a motion, and response and reply, if any, the judge will enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed, either specially or pursuant to the rules of the court, or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> The provisions of subdivisions (d)(2)(A)&ndash;(D) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violations of these rules or under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1927.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 54(d) was revised in several respects. The subdivision was modified to conform its structure to FRCP 54(d). In addition, the subdivision, as rewritten departs from its FRCP counterpart in several respects:</p>
<p class="note-body">First, because the allowance of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in this court is almost always determined under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412 (a), (d) (the Equal Access to Justice Act), it was deemed advisable to reflect this fact in subdivision (d)(2) rather than to retain the broader, but potentially misleading, language that appears in FRCP 54(d)(1). <em>See Neal & Co. v. United States</em>, 121 F.3d 683 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, subdivision (d)(1) was enlarged beyond the scope of its FRCP counterpart by the incorporation of RCFC 77.4 (&ldquo;Taxation of Costs&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, subdivision (d)(2) brings together relevant sections of its FRCP counterpart and former RCFC 81(e) (&ldquo;Application for Attorneys&rsquo; Fees&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the time periods for objecting to a Bill of Costs and for requesting review of the clerk's action were enlarged.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 55. Default</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Entry.</strong> When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party's default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Judgment.</strong> No judgment by default shall be entered unless the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court. The party entitled to a judgment by default shall apply to the court therefor; but no judgment by default shall be entered against an infant or incompetent person unless represented in the action by a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other such representative who has appeared therein. If the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action, the party (or, if appearing by representative, the party's representative) shall be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior to the hearing on such application. If, in order to enable the court to enter judgment or to carry it into effect, it is necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of damages or to establish the truth of any averment by evidence or to make an investigation of any other matter, the court may conduct such hearings or order such references as it deems necessary and proper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Setting Aside Default.</strong> For good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in accordance with RCFC 60(b).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:443 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Plaintiffs; Counterclaimants.</strong> The provisions of this rule apply whether the party entitled to the judgment by default is a plaintiff, a third-party plaintiff, or a party who has pleaded a counterclaim. In all cases a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of RCFC 54(c).</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 55 recognizes the distinction between entry of default and entry of judgment for default. Substantial changes were made. The language in former subdivision (b)(1), permitting entry of default judgment by the clerk, is omitted. Additionally, the protection previously afforded only to the United States&mdash;prohibiting entry of default judgments absent a showing by the claimant of a right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court&mdash;is expanded to include all parties. Judgment requires proof and involvement of the court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 56. Summary Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) For Claimant.</strong> A party seeking to recover upon a claim or counterclaim or to obtain a declaratory judgment may, at any time after the expiration of 60 days from the commencement of the action in this court or after service of a motion for summary judgment by the adverse party, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in such party's favor upon all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) For Defending Party.</strong> A party against whom a claim or counterclaim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in the party's favor as to all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motion and Proceedings Thereon.</strong> The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on Motion.</strong> If on motion under this rule judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel, shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony; Defense Required.</strong> Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith. The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) When Affidavits Are Unavailable.</strong> Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Affidavits Made in Bad Faith.</strong> Should it appear to the satisfaction of the court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this rule are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order the party employing them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any offending party or attorney may be adjudged guilty of contempt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Procedures.</strong> The following procedures shall be followed with respect to motions for summary judgment other than in actions seeking review of a decision on the basis of an administrative record:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The moving or cross-moving party shall file, together with its motion, a separate document titled Proposed Findings of Uncontroverted Fact. This document shall contain concise, separately numbered paragraphs setting forth all of the material facts upon which the party bases its motion and as to which the party believes there is no genuine dispute. Each paragraph shall contain citations to the opposing party's pleadings or to documentary evidence, such as affidavits or exhibits, filed with the motion or otherwise part of the record in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The opposing party shall file, together with its opposition, a response to the requested findings by indicating, immediately below each finding, whether it agrees or disagrees with the finding as stated. If the opposing party does not agree with the proposed finding, it shall note the basis for its objection and may draft a proposed revision of the finding directly below the challenged finding. The opposing party may also file proposed findings of uncontroverted fact as to any relevant matters not covered by the moving party's statement. Such additional statements of proposed findings shall be set forth with the proposed findings applicable to any cross-motion, but in the absence of a cross-motion shall be set forth in a separate document. Responses to such additional proposed findings shall be filed in a format which conforms to the instructions noted above.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:444 --><p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The parties may dispense with the documents called for in subdivision (h)(1) and (2) if they file, no later than the time of the initial motion, a comprehensive stipulation of all of the material facts upon which they intend to rely. In determining any motion for summary judgment, the court will, absent persuasive reason to the contrary, deem the material facts claimed and adequately supported by the moving party to be established, except to the extent that such material facts are controverted by affidavit or other written or oral evidence.</p>

<p class="note-body">The subdivision structure of RCFC 56 was reordered to more closely conform to FRCP 56.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedures.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The moving or cross-moving party shall file, together with its motion, a separate document titled Statement of Facts setting forth the facts necessary to resolve the issues presented on review. This document shall contain concise, separately numbered paragraphs setting forth all of the facts upon which the party bases its motion and which are supported by the record. Each paragraph shall contain citations to the opposing party's pleadings or to documentary evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The opposing party shall file, together with its opposition or cross-motion, a separate document titled Counter-Statement of Facts. This document shall indicate immediately below each statement of fact whether it agrees or disagrees with the fact as stated. The party shall state the precise nature of its disagreement and give its version of the events supported by record citations. The opposing party may also file Proposed Additional Facts as to any relevant matters not covered by the moving party's statement to which the movant shall respond in like format.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 56.1 has no FRCP counterpart. In the interests of procedural clarity, the text of subdivision (a) was modified to reflect current practice with respect to supplementation of the administrative record, and subdivision (b)(2) was modified to make explicit an opposing party's right to file an opposition as well as a cross-motion. In addition, the rule was conformed to RCFC 56 practice, in that the statement of facts and counter-statement of facts are incorporated into a single document. In all other respects, RCFC 56.1 remains unchanged.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Remand.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Issuance of Remand Order.</strong> At the request of a party or on its own motion, the court may in any case within its jurisdiction by order remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as may be deemed proper and just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Content of Remand Order.</strong> An order of remand shall (A) delineate the area of further consideration or action deemed warranted on the remand, (B) fix the duration of the remand period, not to exceed 6 months, and (C) specify the extent to which court proceedings shall be stayed during the remand period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Service of Order.</strong> A certified copy of any order issued pursuant to this rule shall be served by the clerk on the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order is directed. A copy of the order shall be served on each party in conformity with RCFC 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Transmittal of Administrative Record.</strong> Following service of the order as provided for in this rule, the clerk shall transmit the administrative record, if any, to the Department of Justice for return to the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order of remand is directed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Advice of Administrative Action.</strong> In every case in which an order of remand is entered pursuant to this rule, the attorney of record for the party so designated in the order of remand shall report to the court the status of proceedings on remand at intervals of 90 days or less, beginning with the date of the order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Extension or Termination of Stay of Proceedings on Remand; Disposition of Case.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Extension.</strong> If the administrative or executive body or official has not, during the period of stay provided for in an order of remand pursuant to subdivision (a), rendered a decision on the matter remanded, the party to whom opportunity was afforded to obtain further administrative consideration shall, by motion pursuant to RCFC 6, request an extension of the stay of proceedings, or, by motion pursuant to RCFC 7, request the initiation of proceedings toward otherwise disposing of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Disposition at Administrative Level.</strong> If, during the period of the stay of proceedings as provided for in a remand order, the parties dispose of the case at the administrative level, the plaintiff shall file a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.</p>

A copy of such decision or action shall be served on each party by the clerk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Action by the Parties.</strong> Within 30 days after the filing of a decision or final action pursuant to subdivision (3), each party shall file with the clerk a notice indicating whether <!-- PDFPage:445 -->or not the decision or final action on remand affords a satisfactory basis for disposition of the claim at the administrative level, or whether further proceedings before the court are deemed required, and, if such proceedings are desired, what those proceedings should be. A copy of such notice shall be served on each adverse party in conformity with RCFC 5. Thereafter, the court will enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed, either specially or pursuant to the rules of the court, or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Grounds.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A new trial or rehearing or reconsideration may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues, for any of the reasons established by the rules of com<!-- PDFPage:446 -->mon law or equity applicable as between private parties in the courts of the United States. On a motion under this rule, the court may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The court, at any time while a suit is pending before it, or after proceedings for review have been instituted, or within 2 years after the final disposition of the suit, may grant the United States a new trial and stay the payment of any judgment upon satisfactory evidence, cumulative or otherwise, that any fraud, wrong, or injustice has been done to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Time for Motion and Response.</strong> Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2), a motion for a new trial, or for amendment or reconsideration of a judgment, shall be filed no later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment. When such a motion is based on affidavits, they shall be filed with the motion. No response to any motion under this rule may be filed, unless requested by the court. The court will not rule in favor of any motion under this rule without first requesting by order a response to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Time for Serving Affidavits.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) On Court's Initiative; Notice; Specifying Grounds.</strong> No later than 10 days after entry of judgment the court, on its own, may order a new trial for any reason that would justify granting one on a party's motion. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion. When granting a new trial on its own initiative or for a reason not stated in a motion, the court shall specify the grounds in its order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment.</strong> Any motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 60. Relief from Judgment or Order</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Clerical Mistakes.</strong> Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with leave of the appellate court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, Etc.</strong> On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under RCFC 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court. Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill of review, are abolished, and the procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Automatic Stay; Exceptions&mdash;Injunctions and Patent Accountings.</strong> Except as stated herein, no execution shall issue upon a judgment nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of 10 days after its entry. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction, or a judgment or order directing an accounting in an action for infringement of letters patent, shall not be stayed during the pe<!-- PDFPage:447 -->riod after its entry and until an appeal is taken or during the pendency of an appeal. The provisions of subdivision (c) of this rule govern the suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting of an injunction during the pendency of an appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Stay on Motion for New Trial or for Judgment.</strong> In its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, the court may stay the execution of or any proceedings to enforce a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment made pursuant to RCFC 59, or of a motion for relief from a judgment or order made pursuant to RCFC 60, or of a motion for amendment to the findings or for additional findings made pursuant to RCFC 52(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Injunction Pending Appeal.</strong> When an appeal is taken from an interlocutory or final judgment granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction, the court in its discretion may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Stay Upon Appeal.</strong> When an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay subject to the exceptions contained in subdivision (a) of this rule. The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the appeal, as the case may be. The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Stay in Favor of the United States or Agency Thereof.</strong> When an appeal is taken by the United States or an officer or agency thereof or by direction of any department of the Government of the United States and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall be required from the appellant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Stay According to State Law.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Power of Appellate Court Not Limited.</strong> The provisions in this rule do not limit any power of an appellate court or of a judge or justice thereof to stay proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of an appeal or to make any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Stay of Judgment as to Multiple Claims or Multiple Parties.</strong> When a court has ordered a final judgment under the conditions stated in RCFC 54(b), the court may stay enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.</p>
