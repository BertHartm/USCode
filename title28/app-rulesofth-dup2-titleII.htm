<h3 class="section-head">Rule 3. Commencement of Action</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Commencement. A civil action is commenced by filing with the clerk of the court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A summons in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(a) or (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A summons, and within 30 days thereafter a complaint, in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c) to contest a determination listed in section 516A(a)(2) or (3) of the Tariff Act of 1930; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A summons and complaint concurrently in all other actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Filing Fee. When an action is commenced, a $150 filing fee shall be paid to the clerk of the court, except that</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a $120 filing fee shall be paid when the action is one described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a $25 filing fee shall be paid when the action is one described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(d)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Complaint Fee. When a complaint is filed in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(a), a $30 fee shall be paid to the clerk of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Information Statement. When an action is commenced, the party commencing the action shall file the original and one copy of a completed Information Statement on the form shown in Form 5 in the Appendix of Forms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Amendment of Summons. The court may allow a summons to be amended at any time, in its discretion and upon such terms as it deems just, unless it clearly appears that material prejudice would result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the amendment is allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notice to Interested Parties. In an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c), the plaintiff, as provided in section 516A(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, shall notify every interested party who was a party to the administrative proceeding of the commencement of the action, by mailing a copy of the summons at the time the action is commenced, or promptly thereafter, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to each such party at the address last known in the administrative proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon filing of a complaint in an action described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c), the plaintiff shall promptly serve a copy of the complaint, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, on every interested party who was a party to the administrative proceeding at the address last known in that proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Precedence of Action. Unless the court, upon motion for good cause or upon its own initiative, determines otherwise in a particular action, the following actions shall be given precedence, in the following order, over other actions pending before the court, and expedited in every way:</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Practice Comment</h4>
<p class="note-body">For the appropriate summons form and number of copies to be filed, refer to Forms 1 to 4 of the Appendix of Forms. Information Statement forms, as shown in Form 5, are available upon request from the office of the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">As prescribed by Rule 5(e), a summons or a summons and complaint may be filed by delivery or by mailing. The filing is completed when received, except that when the method of mailing prescribed by Rule 5(g) is used, the summons or summons and complaint are deemed filed as of the date of mailing.</p>
<p class="note-body">To provide information to assist a judge in determining whether there is reason for disqualification upon <!-- PDFPage:428 -->the grounds of a financial interest, under 28 U.S.C. &sect;455, a completed &ldquo;Disclosure Statement&rdquo; form, available upon request from the office of the clerk, must be filed by certain corporations, trade associations, and others appearing as parties, intervenors, or <em>amicus curiae</em>. A copy of the &ldquo;Disclosure Statement&rdquo; form is shown in Form 13 of the Appendix of Forms.</p>
<p class="note-body">Internal inconsistencies exist within the provisions of the Customs Courts Act of 1980 with respect to the method of commencing two kinds of actions. The two kinds are described in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(d), adjustment assistance actions, and 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(g), customhouse broker license actions. Both of these are included among those actions which are, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2632(a), to be commenced by filing concurrently a summons and complaint with the clerk of the court as prescribed by the rules of the court. The rules of the court require the plaintiff to cause concurrent service of the summons and complaint to be made. (See Rules 3(a) and 4(b)).</p>
<p class="note-body">The inconsistency pertaining to adjustment assistance actions appears in 19 U.S.C. &sect;2395, which requires the clerk of the court, instead of the plaintiff, to serve a copy of the summons and complaint upon the Secretary of Labor or Secretary of Commerce as the case may be. The inconsistency pertaining to customhouse broker license actions appears in 19 U.S.C. &sect;1641(b), which provides that an action is commenced by filing &ldquo;a written petition&rdquo; in the court and further provides that a copy of the petition is to be &ldquo;transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of the Treasury.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Until such time as the matter is resolved, the preferred procedure to achieve uniformity and consistency and to minimize the ambiguity created by these inconsistent statutory provisions is to follow the provisions in Title 28. (In one unreported case, <em>James A. Barnhart v. United States</em>, Court No. 81&ndash;3&ndash;00328, the court directed plaintiff to comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. &sect;2632(a) by filing a summons and complaint notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff had complied with the requirements of 19 U.S.C. &sect;1641(b) by filing a petition.)</p>
<p class="note-body">As provided in Section 516A(a)(2) and (3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, a complaint shall be filed within 30 days after the filing of the summons. <em>See Georgetown Steel v. United States</em>, 801 F.2d 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">Nevertheless, counsel are encouraged to commence any action described in Section 516A(a)(2) or (3) of the Tariff Act of 1930 and 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(c) by the concurrent filing of a summons and complaint. This will serve to expedite the prosecution of the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">When an action is commenced, counsel should contact the Clerk's Office not more than 24 hours prior to filing to obtain a court number and shall endorse that court number on the summons and complaint. Counsel for plaintiff shall be responsible for service of the summons and complaint as prescribed in Rules 4(b), (c), (d) and (e). Under these circumstances, the clerk of the court will not make service of the summons as prescribed in Rule 4(a)(4).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Summons and Complaint&mdash;Service by Plaintiff. In any action required to be commenced by the concurrent filing of a summons and complaint, the plaintiff shall cause service of the summons and complaint to be made in accordance with this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Service of a summons and complaint may be effected by any person who is not a party and who is at least 18 years of age. At the request of the plaintiff, however, the court may direct that service be effected by a United States marshal, deputy United States marshal, or other person or officer specially appointed by the court for that purpose. Such an appointment must be made when the plaintiff is authorized to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1915.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:430 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) In an action commenced under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(d), the court is authorized to serve the summons and complaint where the action was commenced <em>pro se</em> and the plaintiff has failed to make service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Waiver of Service; Duty to Save Costs of Service; Request to Waive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) When the plaintiff files a waiver of service with the court, the action shall proceed, except as provided in paragraph (3), as if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing the waiver, and no proof of service shall be required.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k) Territorial Limits of Effective Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service is effective to establish jurisdiction over the person of a defendant</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) who is a party joined under USCIT R. 14 or 19 and is served at a place within a judicial district of the United States, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) when authorized by a statute of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service is also effective, with respect to claims arising under federal law, to establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Proof of Service. If service is not waived, the person effecting service shall make proof thereof to the court.

Proof of service in a place not within any judicial district of the United States shall, if effected under paragraph (1) of subdivision (f), be made pursuant to the applicable treaty or convention, and shall, if effected under paragraph (2) or (3) thereof, include a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence of delivery to the addressee satisfactory to the court. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service. The court may allow proof of service to be amended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) Time Limit For Service. If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision does not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (f) or (j)(1).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5. Service and Filing of Pleadings and Other Papers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Service&mdash;When Required. Unless otherwise prescribed by these rules, or by order of the court, every pleading and other paper shall be served upon each of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Service&mdash;How Made. Whenever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party represented by an attorney, the service shall be made upon the attorney unless service upon the party is ordered by the court. Service upon the attorney or upon the party shall be made by delivering a copy to the attorney or party or by mailing it to the attorney or party at the attorney's or party's last known address or, if no address is known, by leaving it with the clerk of the court. Delivery is made by: handing a copy to the attorney or to the party; or leaving it at the attorney's or party's office with a clerk or other person in charge thereof; or, if there is no one in charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or, if the office is closed or the person to be served has no office, leaving it at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Service&mdash;Numerous Defendants. In any action in which there are unusually large numbers of defendants, the court, upon motion or its own initiative, may order that service of the pleadings of the defendants and replies thereto need not be made between the defendants and that any cross-claim, counterclaim, or matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense contained therein shall be deemed to be denied or avoided by all other parties, and that the filing of any such pleadings and service thereof upon the plaintiff constitute due notice of it to the parties. A copy of every order shall be served upon the parties in such manner and form as the court directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Filing&mdash;When Required. All pleadings and other papers required to be served upon a party shall be filed with the court immediately after service, unless otherwise prescribed by these rules, or by order of the court. Depositions upon oral examinations and interrogatories, requests for documents, requests for admission, other discovery documents, and answers and responses thereto shall not be filed unless by order of the court on motion or on its own initiative, or for use in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Filing&mdash;How Made. The filing of pleadings and other papers with the court shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court, except that the judge to whom an action is assigned, or a matter is referred, may permit pleadings and other papers pertaining thereto to be filed with the judge, in which event the judge shall note thereon the filing date and forthwith transmit them to the office of the clerk. Filing with the clerk of the court shall be made by delivery or by mailing to: The Clerk of the Court, United States Court of International Trade, One Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278&ndash;0001; or by delivery to the clerk at places other than New York City when the papers pertain to an action being tried or heard at that place. Filing is completed when received, except that a pleading or other paper mailed by certified or registered mail properly addressed to the clerk of the court, with the proper postage affixed and return receipt requested, shall be deemed filed as of the date of mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Filing of Summons and Complaint by Mail. When an action is commenced by the filing of a summons only, or the concurrent filing of a summons and complaint, and the filing is made by mail as prescribed by these rules, the mailing shall be by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, properly addressed to the clerk of the court, with the proper postage affixed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Proof of Service. Unless otherwise prescribed by these rules, or by order of the court, papers presented for filing shall contain an acknowledgment of service by the person served, or proof of service in the form of a statement of the date and manner of service and of the name of the person served, certified by the person who made service. Proof of service may appear on or be affixed to the paper filed. The clerk may, for good cause shown, permit papers to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service but shall require proof to be filed promptly thereafter.</p>

<p class="note-body">When the clerk concludes that exigencies so require, the clerk may permit a pleading or paper to be filed by facsimile transmission or similar process. Service by such process may be made with the consent of the party to be served. Certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, must be used, as prescribed in Rule 5(f), when an action is commenced by the filing of a summons only, or the concurrent filing of a summons and complaint, and the filing is made by mail.</p>
<p class="note-body">When a party is represented in an action by more than one attorney of record, the party shall designate only one attorney of record to serve, file and receive service of pleadings and other papers on behalf of the party.</p>
<p class="note-body">When service is to be made upon a party represented by an attorney, service shall be made upon the attorney of record, unless otherwise ordered by the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">When proof of service is made in the form of a statement, as prescribed in Rule 5(h), and the person served is an attorney, the statement shall identify the name of the party represented by the attorney served.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that &ldquo;the clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or any local rules or practices.&rdquo; By contrast USCIT Rule 5 contains no such limitation. Instead, the responsibilities and limitations of the Clerk of the United States Court of International Trade with respect to the acceptance or rejection of a paper submitted for filing are contained in USCIT Rule 82(d), which has no counterpart within the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it</p>
<p class="statutory-body-block">is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday,<sup><a href="#Rule_6_1_target" name="Rule_6_1">1</a></sup> or when the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court, a day on which weather or other conditions have made the office of the clerk inaccessible, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Extension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of the court, an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court may upon motion, for good cause shown, order the period extended; but it may not extend the time for taking any action under Rules 50(b) and (c)(2), 52(b), 59(b), (d) and (e), and 60(b), except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The motion for extension of time must set forth the specific number of additional days requested, the date to which the extension is to run, the extent to which the time for the performance of the particular act has been previously extended, and the reason or reasons upon which the motion is based. The motion shall be filed prior to the expiration of the period allowed for the performance of the act to which the motion relates (including any previous extension of time); except, when for good cause shown, the delay in filing was the result of excusable neglect or circumstances beyond the control of the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No disposition shall be made until the court acts upon the motion for extension of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Additional Time After Service by Mail. Whenever a party has the right or obligation to do some act or take some proceeding within a prescribed or allowed period after the service of a pleading, motion, or other paper upon the party, and the service is made by mail, 5 days shall be added to the prescribed or allowed period.</p>
