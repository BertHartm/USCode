<p class="note-body">The title of the position was changed to &ldquo;Assistant Attorney General for Administration&rdquo; by &sect;307 of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88&ndash;426, 78 Stat. 432.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;competitive service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;classified civil service&rdquo; because the term &ldquo;classified civil service&rdquo; formerly used to designate the merit system established by the Civil Service Act of 1883 has become ambiguous due to the creation of the &ldquo;classified&rdquo; pay system. The term &ldquo;competitive service&rdquo; is now customarily used, and appears throughout title 5, United States Code, in place of &ldquo;classified civil service&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;There shall be in the Department of Justice&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary as the title of the position and the fact of appointment by the Attorney General establish the location of the position in the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last 12 words of section 5 of the Reorganization Plan are omitted on authority of the Act of June 5, 1952, ch. 369, &sect;1101 (3d proviso), 66 Stat. 121. The salary of the position is now fixed by &sect;303(e) of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88&ndash;426, 78 Stat. 420, which is codified in section 5316 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
