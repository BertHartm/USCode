<p class="statutory-body">Upon the entry of judgment for the claimant in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property seized under any Act of Congress, such property shall be returned forthwith to the claimant or his agent; but if it appears that there was reasonable cause for the seizure, the court shall cause a proper certificate thereof to be entered and the claimant shall not, in such case, be entitled to costs, nor shall the person who made the seizure, nor the prosecutor, be liable to suit or judgment on account of such suit or prosecution.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;818, 827 (R.S. &sect;&sect;970, 979).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 818 and 827 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes of phraseology necessary to effect the consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property&rdquo; were inserted in conformity with the uniform course of judicial decisions. See <em>Hammel v. Little</em>, App.D.C. 1936, 87 F.2d 907, and cases there cited.</p>
<p class="note-body">The qualifying language of section 827 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring the claimant to pay his own costs before the return of his property was omitted as unnecessary and involving a matter more properly for regulation by rule of court. (See sections 1913, 1914, and 1925 of this title.)</p>
