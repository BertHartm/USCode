<p class="statutory-body">(C) If there are multiple claims to the same property, the United States shall not be liable for costs and attorneys fees associated with any such claim if the United States&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;818, 827 (R.S. &sect;&sect;970, 979).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 818 and 827 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes of phraseology necessary to effect the consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property&rdquo; were inserted in conformity with the uniform course of judicial decisions. See <em>Hammel v. Little</em>, App.D.C. 1936, 87 F.2d 907, and cases there cited.</p>
<p class="note-body">The qualifying language of section 827 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring the claimant to pay his own costs before the return of his property was omitted as unnecessary and involving a matter more properly for regulation by rule of court. (See sections 1913, 1914, and 1925 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">(See also section 2006 of this title with respect to actions against internal revenue officers and their liability for acts in the performance of official duties.)</p>
