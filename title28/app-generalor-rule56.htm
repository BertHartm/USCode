<h3 class="section-head">Rule 56. Summary Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) For Claimant.</strong> A party seeking to recover upon a claim or counterclaim or to obtain a declaratory judgment may, at any time after the expiration of 60 days from the commencement of the action in this court or after service of a motion for summary judgment by the adverse party, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in such party's favor upon all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) For Defending Party.</strong> A party against whom a claim or counterclaim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in the party's favor as to all or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motion and Proceedings Thereon.</strong> The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on Motion.</strong> If on motion under this rule judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel, shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony; Defense Required.</strong> Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith. The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) When Affidavits are Unavailable.</strong> Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Affidavits Made in Bad Faith.</strong> Should it appear to the satisfaction of the court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this rule are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order the party employing them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any offending party or attorney may be adjudged guilty of contempt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Procedures.</strong> The following procedures shall be followed with respect to motions for summary judgment other than in actions seeking review of a decision on the basis of an administrative record:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The moving or cross-moving party shall file, together with its motion, a separate document titled Proposed Findings of Uncontroverted Fact. This document shall contain concise, separately numbered paragraphs setting forth all of the material facts upon which the party bases its motion and as to which the party believes there is no genuine dispute. Each paragraph shall contain citations to the opposing party's pleadings or to documentary evidence, such as affidavits or exhibits, filed with the motion or otherwise part of the record in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The opposing party shall file, together with its opposition, a response to the requested findings by indicating, immediately below each finding, whether it agrees or disagrees with the finding as stated. If the opposing party does not agree with the proposed finding, it shall note the basis for its objection and may draft a proposed revision of the finding directly below the challenged finding. The opposing party may also file proposed findings of uncontroverted fact as to any relevant mat<!-- PDFPage:427 -->ters not covered by the moving party's statement. Such additional statements of proposed findings shall be set forth with the proposed findings applicable to any cross-motion, but in the absence of a cross-motion shall be set forth in a separate document. Responses to such additional proposed findings shall be filed in a format which conforms to the instructions noted above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The parties may dispense with the documents called for in subdivision (h)(1)&ndash;(2) if they file, no later than the time of the initial motion, a comprehensive stipulation of all of the material facts upon which they intend to rely. In determining any motion for summary judgment, the court will, absent persuasive reason to the contrary, deem the material facts claimed and adequately supported by the moving party to be established, except to the extent that such material facts are controverted by affidavit or other written or oral evidence.</p>

<p class="note-body">The subdivision structure of RCFC 56 was reordered to more closely conform to FRCP 56. In addition, the subdivision outlining the procedures for filing a RCFC 56 motion was changed to eliminate the Statement of Genuine Issues and to require parties to express their views on any particular fact by noting them on a single page, which may include a redraft of the challenged finding.</p>
