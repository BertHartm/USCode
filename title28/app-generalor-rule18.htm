<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Joinder of Claims.</strong> A party asserting a claim to relief as an original claim or counterclaim, may join, either as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims as the party has against an opposing party. A third party may join, to the extent permitted by law, as many claims as the party has against the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Joinder of Remedies.</strong> Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties.</p>
