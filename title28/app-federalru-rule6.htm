<h3 class="section-head">Rule 6. Appeal in a Bankruptcy Case from a Final Judgment, Order, or Decree of a District Court or of a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>Appeal from a judgment, order or decree of a district court exercising original jurisdiction in a bankruptcy case</em>.&mdash;An appeal to a court of appeals from a final judgment, order or decree of a district court exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1334 shall be taken in identical fashion as appeals from other judgments, orders or decrees of district courts in civil actions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Appeal from a judgment, order or decree of a district court or bankruptcy appellate panel exercising appellate jurisdiction in a bankruptcy case</em>.&mdash;(1) Applicability of other rules. All provisions of these rules are applicable to an appeal to a court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(d) from a final judgment, order or decree of a district court or bankruptcy appellate panel exercising appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(a) or (b), except that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Rules 3.1, 4(a)(4), 4(b), 5.1, 9, 10, 11, 12(b), 13&ndash;20, 22&ndash;23, and 24(b) are not applicable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the reference in Rule 3(c) to &ldquo;Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms&rdquo; shall be read as a reference to Form 5; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) when the appeal is from a bankruptcy appellate panel, the term &ldquo;district court&rdquo; as used in any applicable rule, means &ldquo;appellate panel&rdquo;.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Additional rules. In addition to the rules made applicable by subsection (b)(1) of this rule, the following rules shall apply to an appeal to a court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(d) from a final judgment, order or decree of a district court or of a bankruptcy appellate panel exercising appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(a) or (b):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Effect of a Motion for Rehearing on the Time for Appeal. If any party files a timely motion for rehearing under Bankruptcy Rule 8015 in the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel, the time for appeal to the court of appeals for all parties runs from the entry of the order disposing of the motion. A notice of appeal filed after announcement or entry of the district court's or bankruptcy appellate panel's judgment, order, or decree, but before disposition of the motion for rehearing, is ineffective until the date of the entry of the order disposing of the motion for rehearing. Appellate review of the order disposing of the motion requires the party, in compliance with Appellate Rules 3(c) and 6(b)(1)(ii), to amend a previously filed notice of appeal. A party intending to challenge an alteration or amendment of the judgment, order, or decree shall file an amended notice of appeal within the time prescribed by Rule 4, excluding 4(a)(4) and 4(b), measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion. No additional fees will be required for filing the amended notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The record on appeal. Within 10 days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant shall file with the clerk possessed of the record assembled pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 8006, and serve on the appellee, a statement of the issues to be presented on appeal and a designation of the record to be certified and transmitted to the clerk of the court of appeals. If the appellee deems other parts of the record necessary, the appellee shall, within 10 days after service of the appellant's designation, file with the clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of additional parts to be included. The record, redesignated as provided above, plus the proceedings in the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk pursuant to Rule 3(d) shall constitute the record on appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Transmission of the record. When the record is complete for purpose of the appeal, the clerk of the district court or the appellate panel, shall transmit it forthwith to the clerk of the court of appeals. The clerk of the district court or of the appellate panel shall number the documents comprising the record and shall transmit with the record a list of documents correspondingly numbered and identified with reasonable definiteness. Documents of unusual bulk or weight, physical exhibits other than documents, and such other parts of the record as the court of appeals may designate by local rule, shall not be transmitted by the clerk unless the clerk is directed to do so by a party or by the clerk of the court of appeals. A party must make advance arrangements with the clerk for the transportation and receipt of exhibits of unusual bulk or weight. All parties shall take any other action necessary to enable the clerk to assemble and transmit the record. The court of appeals may provide by rule or order that a certified copy of the docket entries shall be transmitted in lieu of the redesignated record, subject to the right of any party to request at any time during the pendency of the appeal that the redesignated record be transmitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Filing of the record. Upon receipt of the record, the clerk of the court of appeals shall file it and shall immediately give notice to all parties of the date on which it was filed. Upon receipt of a certified copy of the docket entries transmitted in lieu of the redesignated record pursuant to rule or order, the clerk of the court of appeals shall file it and shall immediately give notice to all parties of the date on which it was filed.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is substantially a restatement of present procedure. See D.C. Cir. Rule 34; 6th Cir. Rule 11; 7th Cir. Rule 10(d); 10th Cir. Rule 13.</p>
<p class="note-body">Present circuit rules commonly provide that the petition for allowance of an appeal shall be filed within the time allowed by Section 25 of the Bankruptcy Act for taking appeals of right. For the reasons explained in the Note accompanying Rule 4, that rule makes the time for appeal in bankruptcy cases the same as that which obtains in other civil cases and thus supersedes Section 25. Thus the present rule simply continues the former practice of making the time for filing the petition in appeals by allowance the same as that provided for filing the notice of appeal in appeals of right.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment adapts to the practice in appeals by allowance in bankruptcy proceedings the <!-- PDFPage:14 -->provisions of proposed Rule 3(e) above, requiring payment of all fees in the district court at the time of the filing of the notice of appeal. See Note to Rule 3(e), supra.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A new Rule 6 is proposed. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95&ndash;598, 92 Stat. 2549, the Supreme Court decision in <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co</em>., 458 U.S. 50 (1982), and the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98&ndash;353, 98 Stat. 333, have made the existing Rule 6 obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Subdivision (a) provides that when a district court exercises original jurisdiction in a bankruptcy matter, rather than referring it to a bankruptcy judge for a final determination, the appeal should be taken in identical fashion as appeals from district court decisions in other civil actions. A district court exercises original jurisdiction and this subdivision applies when the district court enters a final order or judgment upon consideration of a bankruptcy judge's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a non-core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;157(c)(1) or when a district court withdraws a proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;157(d). This subdivision is included to avoid uncertainty arising from the question of whether a bankruptcy case is a civil case. The rules refer at various points to the procedure &ldquo;in a civil case&rdquo;, <em>see</em>, e.g. Rule 4(a)(1). Subdivision (a) makes it clear that such rules apply to an appeal from a district court bankruptcy decision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Subdivision (b) governs appeals that follow intermediate review of a bankruptcy judge's decision by a district court or a bankruptcy appellate panel.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)</em>. Subdivision (b)(1) provides for the general applicability of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, with specified exceptions, to appeals covered by subdivision (b) and makes necessary word adjustments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)</em>. Paragraph (i) provides that the time for filing a notice of appeal shall begin to run anew from the entry of an order denying a rehearing or from the entry of a subsequent judgment. The Committee deliberately omitted from the rule any provision governing the validity of a notice of appeal filed prior to the entry of an order denying a rehearing; the Committee intended to leave undisturbed the current state of the law on that issue. Paragraph (ii) calls for a redesignation of the appellate record assembled in the bankruptcy court pursuant to Rule 8006 of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. After an intermediate appeal, a party may well narrow the focus of its efforts on the second appeal and a redesignation of the record may eliminate unnecessary material. The proceedings during the first appeal are included to cover the possibility that independent error in the intermediate appeal, for example failure to follow appropriate procedures, may be assigned in the court of appeals. Paragraph (iii) provides for the transmission of the record and tracks the appropriate subsections of Rule 11. Paragraph (iv) provides for the filing of the record and notices to the parties. Paragraph (ii) and Paragraph (iv) both refer to &ldquo;a certified copy of the docket entries&rdquo;. The &ldquo;docket entries&rdquo; referred to are the docket entries in the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel, not the entire docket in the bankruptcy court.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Note to Subparagraph (b)(2)(i). The amendment accompanies concurrent changes to Rule 4(a)(4). Although Rule 6 never included language such as that being changed in Rule 4(a)(4), language that made a notice of appeal void if it was filed before, or during the pendency of, certain posttrial motions, courts have found that a notice of appeal is premature if it is filed before the court disposes of a motion for rehearing. <em>See, e.g., In re X-Cel, Inc</em>., 823 F.2d 192 (7th Cir. 1987); <em>In re Shah</em>, 859 F.2d 1463 (10th Cir. 1988). The Committee wants to achieve the same result here as in Rule 4, the elimination of a procedural trap.</p>
