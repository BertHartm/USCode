<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Expeditious Review; Limited Inquiry</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The chief judge shall expeditiously review any complaint received under section 351(a) or identified under section 351(b). In determining what action to take, the chief judge may conduct a limited inquiry for the purpose of determining&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For this purpose, the chief judge may request the judge whose conduct is complained of to file a written response to the complaint. Such response shall not be made available to the complainant unless authorized by the judge filing the response. The chief judge or his or her designee may also communicate orally or in writing with the complainant, the judge whose conduct is complained of, and any other person who may have knowledge of the matter, and may review any transcripts or other relevant documents.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) frivolous, lacking sufficient evidence to raise an inference that misconduct has occurred, or containing allegations which are incapable of being established through investigation; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when a limited inquiry conducted under subsection (a) demonstrates that the allegations in the complaint lack any factual foundation or are conclusively refuted by objective evidence; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:109 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conclude the proceeding if the chief judge finds that appropriate corrective action has been taken or that action on the complaint is no longer necessary because of intervening events.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The chief judge shall transmit copies of the written order to the complainant and to the judge whose conduct is the subject of the complaint.</p>
