<p class="note-body">Section consolidates and simplifies sections 484 and 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. For provisions with respect to classified civil service, see sections 631&ndash;684 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerks and messengers in the office of United States at<!-- PDFPage:220 -->torney, southern district of New York. Section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerical assistants for all United States attorneys. It was not affected by section 678 of title 5 U.S.C. 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, according to a Department of Justice interpretation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision of said section 593 for office expenses of United States attorneys is covered by section 509 [now 549] of this title.</p>

Under section 550 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title the marshals will make such payments including the office expenses of United States attorneys.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision in such section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the need for clerical assistants be certified by the district judge, was omitted as unnecessary. The need may be determined by the Attorney General.</p>
