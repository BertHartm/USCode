<p class="statutory-body">1. The following forms are intended for illustration only. They are limited in number. No attempt is made to furnish a manual of forms. Each form assumes the action to be brought in the Southern District of New York. If the district in which an action is brought has divisions, the division should be indicated in the caption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. Except where otherwise indicated each pleading, motion, and other paper should have a caption similar to that of the summons, with the designation of the particular paper substituted for the word &ldquo;Summons&rdquo;. In the caption of the summons and in the caption of the complaint all parties must be named but in other pleadings and papers, it is sufficient to state the name of the first party on either side, with an appropriate indication of other parties. See Rules 4(b), 7(b)(2), and 10(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. In Form 3 and the forms following, the words, &ldquo;Allegation of jurisdiction,&rdquo; are used to indicate the appropriate allegation in Form 2.</p>
