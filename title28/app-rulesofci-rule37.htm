<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Motion for an Order Compelling Disclosure or Discovery.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> On notice to other parties and all affected persons, a party may move for an order compelling disclosure or discovery. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an effort to obtain it without court action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Appropriate Court.</em> A motion for an order to a party must be made in the court where the action is pending. A motion for an order to a nonparty must be made in the court where the discovery is or will be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Specific Motions.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>To Compel Disclosure.</em> If a party fails to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a), any other party may move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>To Compel a Discovery Response.</em> A party seeking discovery may move for an order compelling an answer, designation, production, or inspection. This motion may be made if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a deponent fails to answer a question asked under Rule 30 or 31;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a corporation or other entity fails to make a designation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 33; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) a party fails to respond that inspection will be permitted&mdash;or fails to permit inspection&mdash;as requested under Rule 34.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Related to a Deposition.</em> When taking an oral deposition, the party asking a question may complete or adjourn the examination before moving for an order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response.</em> For purposes of this subdivision (a), an evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response must be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Payment of Expenses; Protective Orders.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>If the Motion Is Granted (or Disclosure or Discovery Is Provided After Filing).</em> If the motion is granted&mdash;or if the disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the motion was filed&mdash;the court must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant's reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney's fees. But the court must not order this payment if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the movant filed the motion before attempting in good faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the opposing party's nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>If the Motion Is Denied.</em> If the motion is denied, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the movant, the attorney filing the motion, or both to pay the party or deponent who opposed the motion its reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney's fees. But the court must not order this payment if the motion was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>If the Motion Is Granted in Part and Denied in Part.</em> If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, apportion the reasonable expenses for the motion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Failure to Comply with a Court Order.</cap-smallcap></p>
<!-- PDFPage:210 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Sanctions in the District Where the Deposition Is Taken.</em> If the court where the discovery is taken orders a deponent to be sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the failure may be treated as contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Sanctions in the District Where the Action Is Pending.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>For Not Obeying a Discovery Order.</em> If a party or a party's officer, director, or managing agent&mdash;or a witness designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)&mdash;fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order under Rule 26(f), 35, or 37(a), the court where the action is pending may issue further just orders. They may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any order except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>For Not Producing a Person for Examination.</em> If a party fails to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring it to produce another person for examination, the court may issue any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)&ndash;(vi), unless the disobedient party shows that it cannot produce the other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Payment of Expenses.</em> Instead of or in addition to the orders above, the court must order the disobedient party, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Failure to Disclose, to Supplement an Earlier Response, or to Admit.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Failure to Disclose or Supplement.</em> If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may inform the jury of the party's failure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may impose other appropriate sanctions, including any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)&ndash;(vi).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Failure to Admit.</em> If a party fails to admit what is requested under Rule 36 and if the requesting party later proves a document to be genuine or the matter true, the requesting party may move that the party who failed to admit pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in making that proof. The court must so order unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the request was held objectionable under Rule 36(a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the admission sought was of no substantial importance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the party failing to admit had a reasonable ground to believe that it might prevail on the matter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Party's Failure to Attend Its Own Deposition, Serve Answers to Interrogatories, or Respond to a Request for Inspection.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Motion; Grounds for Sanctions.</em> The court where the action is pending may, on motion, order sanctions if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a party or a party's officer, director, or managing agent&mdash;or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)&mdash;fails, after being served with proper notice, to appear for that person's deposition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a party, after being properly served with interrogatories under Rule 33 or a request for inspection under Rule 34, fails to serve its answers, objections, or written response.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Certification.</em> A motion for sanctions for failing to answer or respond must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party failing to act in an effort to obtain the answer or response without court action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Unacceptable Excuse for Failing to Act.</em> A failure described in Rule 37(d)(1)(A) is not excused on the ground that the discovery sought was objectionable, unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a protective order under Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Types of Sanctions.</em> Sanctions may include any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)&ndash;(vi). Instead of or in addition to these sanctions, the court must require the party failing to act, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Failure to Provide Electronically Stored Information.</cap-smallcap> Absent exceptional circumstances, a court may not impose sanctions under these rules on a party for failing to provide electronically stored information lost as a result of the routine, good-faith operation of an electronic information system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Failure to Participate in Framing a Discovery Plan.</cap-smallcap> If a party or its attorney fails to participate in good faith in developing and sub<!-- PDFPage:211 -->mitting a proposed discovery plan as required by Rule 26(f), the court may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require that party or attorney to pay to any other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of this rule authorizing orders establishing facts or excluding evidence or striking pleadings, or authorizing judgments of dismissal or default, for refusal to answer questions or permit inspection or otherwise make discovery, are in accord with <em>Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas</em>, 212 U.S. 322 (1909), which distinguishes between the justifiable use of such measures as a means of compelling the production of evidence, and their unjustifiable use, as in <em>Hovey v. Elliott</em>, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), for the mere purpose of punishing for contempt.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37 provides generally for sanctions against parties or persons unjustifiably resisting discovery. Experience has brought to light a number of defects in the language of the rule as well as instances in which it is not serving the purposes for which it was designed. See Rosenberg, <em>Sanctions to Effectuate Pretrial Discovery</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480 (1958). In addition, changes being made in other discovery rules requiring conforming amendments to Rule 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37 sometimes refers to a &ldquo;failure&rdquo; to afford discovery and at other times to a &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; to do so. Taking note of this dual terminology, courts have imported into &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; a requirement of &ldquo;wilfullness.&rdquo; See <em>Roth v. Paramount Pictures Corp</em>., 8 F.R.D. 31 (W.D.Pa. 1948); <em>Campbell v. Johnson</em>, 101 F.Supp. 705, 707 (S.D.N.Y. 1951). In <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197 (1958), the Supreme Court concluded that the rather random use of these two terms in Rule 37 showed no design to use them with consistently distinctive meanings, that &ldquo;refused&rdquo; in Rule 37(b)(2) meant simply a failure to comply, and that wilfullness was relevant only to the selection of sanctions, if any, to be imposed. Nevertheless, after the decision in <em>Societe</em>, the court in <em>Hinson v. Michigan Mutual Liability Co</em>., 275 F.2d 537 (5th Cir. 1960) once again ruled that &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; required wilfullness. Substitution of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; for &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; throughout Rule 37 should eliminate this confusion and bring the rule into harmony with the <em>Societe Internationale</em> decision. See Rosenberg, <em>supra</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 489&ndash;490 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Rule 37(a) provides relief to a party seeking discovery against one who, with or without stated objections, fails to afford the discovery sought. It has always fully served this function in relation to depositions, but the amendments being made to Rules 33 and 34 give Rule 37(a) added scope and importance. Under existing Rule 33, a party objecting to interrogatories must make a motion for court hearing on his objections. The changes now made in Rules 33 and 37(a) make it clear that the interrogating party must move to compel answers, and the motion is provided for in Rule 37(a). Existing Rule 34, since it requires a court order prior to production of documents or things or permission to enter on land, has no relation to Rule 37(a). Amendments of Rules 34 and 37(a) create a procedure similar to that provided for Rule 33.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)</em>. This is a new provision making clear to which court a party may apply for an order compelling discovery. Existing Rule 37(a) refers only to the court in which the deposition is being taken; nevertheless, it has been held that the court where the action is pending has &ldquo;inherent power&rdquo; to compel a party deponent to answer. <em>Lincoln Laboratories, Inc. v. Savage Laboratories, Inc</em>., 27 F.R.D. 476 (D.Del. 1961). In relation to Rule 33 interrogatories and Rule 34 requests for inspection, the court where the action is pending is the appropriate enforcing tribunal. The new provision eliminates the need to resort to inherent power by spelling out the respective roles of the court where the action is pending and the court where the deposition is taken. In some instances, two courts are available to a party seeking to compel answers from a party deponent. The party seeking discovery may choose the court to which he will apply, but the court has power to remit the party to the other court as a more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2)</em>. This subdivision contains the substance of existing provisions of Rule 37(a) authorizing motions to compel answers to questions put at depositions and to interrogatories. New provisions authorize motions for orders compelling designation under Rules 30(b)(6) and 31(a) and compelling inspection in accordance with a request made under Rule 34. If the court denies a motion, in whole or part, it may accompany the denial with issuance of a protective order. Compare the converse provision in Rule 26(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(3)</em>. This new provision makes clear that an evasive or incomplete answer is to be considered, for purposes of subdivision (a), a failure to answer. The courts have consistently held that they have the power to compel adequate answers. <em>E.g., Cone Mills Corp. v. Joseph Bancroft & Sons Co</em>., 33 F.R.D. 318 (D.Del. 1963). This power is recognized and incorporated into the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(4)</em>. This subdivision amends the provisions for award of expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, to the prevailing party or person when a motion is made for an order compelling discovery. At present, an award of expenses is made only if the losing party or person is found to have acted without substantial justification. The change requires that expenses be awarded unless the conduct of the losing party or person is found to have been substantially justified. The test of &ldquo;substantial justification&rdquo; remains, but the change in language is intended to encourage judges to be more alert to abuses occurring in the discovery process.</p>
<p class="note-body">On many occasions, to be sure, the dispute over discovery between the parties is genuine, though ultimately resolved one way or the other by the court. In such cases, the losing party is substantially justified in carrying the matter to court. But the rules should deter the abuse implicit in carrying or forcing a discovery dispute to court when no genuine dispute exists. And the potential or actual imposition of expenses is virtually the sole formal sanction in the rules to deter a party from pressing to a court hearing frivolous requests for or objections to discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">The present provision of Rule 37(a) that the court shall require payment if it finds that the defeated party acted without &ldquo;substantial justification&rdquo; may appear adequate, but in fact it has been little used. Only a handful of reported cases include an award of expenses, and the Columbia Survey found that in only one instance out of about 50 motions decided under Rule 37(a) did the court award expenses. It appears that the courts do not utilize the most important available sanction to deter abusive resort to the judiciary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed change provides in effect that expenses should ordinarily be awarded unless a court finds that the losing party acted justifiably in carrying his point to court. At the same time, a necessary flexibility is maintained, since the court retains the power to find that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust&mdash;as where the prevailing party also acted unjustifiably. The amendment does not significantly nar<!-- PDFPage:212 -->row the discretion of the court, but rather presses the court to address itself to abusive practices. The present provision that expenses may be imposed upon either the party or his attorney or both is unchanged. But it is not contemplated that expenses will be imposed upon the attorney merely because the party is indigent.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This subdivision deals with sanctions for failure to comply with a court order. The present captions for subsections (1) and (2) entitled, &ldquo;Contempt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Consequences,&rdquo; respectively, are confusing. One of the consequences listed in (2) is the arrest of the party, representing the exercise of the contempt power. The contents of the subsections show that the first authorizes the sanction of contempt (and no other) by the court in which the deposition is taken, whereas the second subsection authorizes a variety of sanctions, including contempt, which may be imposed by the court in which the action is pending. The captions of the subsections are changed to deflect their contents.</p>
<p class="note-body">The scope of Rule 37(b)(2) is broadened by extending it to include any order &ldquo;to provide or permit discovery,&rdquo; including orders issued under Rules 37(a) and 35. Various rules authorize orders for discovery&mdash;<em>e.g</em>., Rule 35 (b)(1), Rule 26(c) as revised. Rule 37(d). See Rosenberg, <em>supra</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 484&ndash;486. Rule 37(b)(2) should provide comprehensively for enforcement of all these orders. <em>Cf. Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197, 207 (1958). On the other hand, the reference to Rule 34 is deleted to conform to the changed procedure in that rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">A new subsection (E) provides that sanctions which have been available against a party for failure to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) to submit to examination will now be available against him for his failure to comply with a Rule 35(a) order to produce a third person for examination, unless he shows that he is unable to produce the person. In this context, &ldquo;unable&rdquo; means in effect &ldquo;unable in good faith.&rdquo; See <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is amplified to provide for payment of reasonable expenses caused by the failure to obey the order. Although Rules 37(b)(2) and 37(d) have been silent as to award of expenses, courts have nevertheless ordered them on occasion. <em>E.g., United Sheeplined Clothing Co. v. Arctic Fur Cap Corp</em>., 165 F.Supp. 193 (S.D.N.Y.1958); <em>Austin Theatre, Inc. v. Warner Bros. Picture, Inc</em>., 22 F.R.D. 302 (S.D.N.Y. 1958). The provision places the burden on the disobedient party to avoid expenses by showing that his failure is justified or that special circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Allocating the burden in this way conforms to the changed provisions as to expenses in Rule 37(a), and is particularly appropriate when a court order is disobeyed.</p>
<p class="note-body">An added reference to directors of a party is similar to a change made in subdivision (d) and is explained in the note to that subdivision. The added reference to persons designated by a party under Rules 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of the party carries out the new procedure in those rules for taking a deposition of a corporation or other organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Rule 37(c) provides a sanction for the enforcement of Rule 36 dealing with requests for admission. Rule 36 provides the mechanism whereby a party may obtain from another party in appropriate instances either (1) and admission, or (2) a sworn and specific denial, or (3) a sworn statement &ldquo;setting forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny.&rdquo; If the party obtains the second or third of these responses, in proper form, Rule 36 does not provide for a pretrial hearing on whether the response is warranted by the evidence thus far accumulated. Instead, Rule 37(c) is intended to provide posttrial relief in the form of a requirement that the party improperly refusing the admission pay the expenses of the other side in making the necessary proof at trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37(c), as now written, addresses itself in terms only to the sworn denial and is silent with respect to the statement of reasons for an inability to admit or deny. There is no apparent basis for this distinction, since the sanction provided in Rule 37(c) should deter all unjustified failures to admit. This omission in the rule has caused confused and diverse treatment in the courts. One court has held that if a party gives inadequate reasons, he should be treated before trial as having denied the request, so that Rule 37(c) may apply. <em>Bertha Bldg. Corp. v. National Theatres Corp</em>., 15 F.R.D. 339 (E.D.N.Y. 1954). Another has held that the party should be treated as having admitted the request. <em>Heng Hsin Co. v. Stern, Morgenthau & Co</em>., 20 Fed.Rules Serv. 36a.52, Case 1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 10, 1954). Still another has ordered a new response, without indicating what the outcome should be if the new response were inadequate. <em>United States Plywood Corp. v. Hudson Lumber Co</em>., 127 F.Supp. 489, 497&ndash;498 (S.D.N.Y. 1954). See generally Finman, <em>The Request for Admissions in Federal Civil Procedure</em>, 71 Yale L.J. 371, 426&ndash;430 (1962). The amendment eliminates this defect in Rule 37(c) by bringing within its scope all failures to admit.</p>
<p class="note-body">Additional provisions in Rule 37(c) protect a party from having to pay expenses if the request for admission was held objectionable under Rule 36(a) or if the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that he might prevail on the matter. The latter provision emphasizes that the true test under Rule 37(c) is not whether a party prevailed at trial but whether he acted reasonably in believing that he might prevail.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The scope of subdivision (d) is broadened to include responses to requests for inspection under Rule 34, thereby conforming to the new procedures of Rule 34.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two related changes are made in subdivision (d): the permissible sanctions are broadened to include such orders &ldquo;as are just&rdquo;; and the requirement that the failure to appear or respond be &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is eliminated. Although Rule 37(d) in terms provides for only three sanctions, all rather severe, the courts have interpreted it as permitting softer sanctions than those which it sets forth. <em>E.g., Gill v. Stolow</em>, 240 F.2d 669 (2d Cir. 1957); <em>Saltzman v. Birrell</em>, 156 F.Supp. 538 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 554&ndash;557 (Wright ed. 1961). The rule is changed to provide the greater flexibility as to sanctions which the cases show is needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The resulting flexibility as to sanctions eliminates any need to retain the requirement that the failure to appear or respond be &ldquo;wilful.&rdquo; The concept of &ldquo;wilful failure&rdquo; is at best subtle and difficult, and the cases do not supply a bright line. Many courts have imposed sanctions without referring to wilfullness. <em>E.g., Milewski v. Schneider Transportation Co</em>., 238 F.2d 397 (6th Cir. 1956); <em>Dictograph Products, Inc. v. Kentworth Corp</em>., 7 F.R.D. 543 (W.D.Ky. 1947). In addition, in view of the possibility of light sanctions, even a negligent failure should come within Rule 37(d). If default is caused by counsel's ignorance of Federal practice, cf. <em>Dunn. v. Pa. R.R</em>., 96 F. Supp. 597 (N.D.Ohio 1951), or by his preoccupation with another aspect of the case, <em>cf. Maurer-Neuer, Inc. v. United Packinghouse Workers</em>, 26 F.R.D. 139 (D.Kans. 1960), dismissal of the action and default judgment are not justified, but the imposition of expenses and fees may well be. &ldquo;Wilfullness&rdquo; continues to play a role, along with various other factors, in the choice of sanctions. Thus, the scheme conforms to Rule 37(b) as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197, 208 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision is added to make clear that a party may not properly remain completely silent even when he regards a notice to take his deposition or a set of interrogatories or requests to inspect as improper and objectionable. If he desires not to appear or not to respond, he must apply for a protective order. The cases are divided on whether a protective order must be sought. Compare <em>Collins v. Wayland</em>, 139 F.2d 677 (9th Cir. 1944), <em>cert. den</em>. 322 U.S. 744; <em>Bourgeois v. El Paso Natural Gas Co</em>., 20 F.R.D. 358 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); <em>Loosley v. Stone</em>, 15 F.R.D. 373 (S.D.Ill. 1954), with <em>Scarlatos v. Kulukundis</em>, 21 F.R.D. 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1957); <em>Ross v. True Temper Corp</em>., 11 F.R.D 307 (N.D.Ohio 1951). Compare also Rosenberg, <!-- PDFPage:213 --><em>supra</em>, 58 Col.L.Rev. 480, 496 (1958) with 2A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 530&ndash;531 (Wright ed. 1961). The party from whom discovery is sought is afforded, through Rule 26(c), a fair and effective procedure whereby he can challenge the request made. At the same time, the total non-compliance with which Rule 37(d) is concerned may impose severe inconvenience or hardship on the discovering party and substantially delay the discovery process. <em>Cf</em>. 2B Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 306&ndash;307 (Wright ed. 1961) (response to a subpoena).</p>
<p class="note-body">The failure of an officer or managing agent of a party to make discovery as required by present Rule 37(d) is treated as the failure of the party. The rule as revised provides similar treatment for a director of a party. There is slight warrant for the present distinction between officers and managing agents on the one hand and directors on the other. Although the legal power over a director to compel his making discovery may not be as great as over officers or managing agents, <em>Campbell v. General Motors Corp</em>., 13 F.R.D. 331 (S.D.N.Y. 1952), the practical differences are negligible. That a director's interests are normally aligned with those of his corporation is shown by the provisions of old Rule 26(d)(2), transferred to 32(a)(2) (deposition of director of party may be used at trial by an adverse party for any purpose) and of Rule 43(b) (director of party may be treated at trial as a hostile witness on direct examination by any adverse party). Moreover, in those rare instances when a corporation is unable through good faith efforts to compel a director to make discovery, it is unlikely that the court will impose sanctions. <em>Cf. Societe Internationale v. Rogers</em>, 357 U.S. 197 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The change in the caption conforms to the language of 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783, as amended in 1964.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. Until recently, costs of a civil action could be awarded against the United States only when expressly provided by Act of Congress, and such provision was rarely made. See H.R.Rept.No. 1535, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2&ndash;3 (1966). To avoid any conflict with this doctrine, Rule 37(f) has provided that expenses and attorney's fees may not be imposed upon the United States under Rule 37. See 2A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 857 (Wright ed. 1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">A major change in the law was made in 1966, 80 Stat. 308, 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412 (1966), whereby a judgment for costs may ordinarily be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States. Costs are not to include the fees and expenses of attorneys. In light of this legislative development, Rule 37(f) is amended to permit the award of expenses and fees against the United States under Rule 37, but only to the extent permitted by statute. The amendment brings Rule 37(f) into line with present and future statutory provisions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1980 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)</em>. New Rule 26(f) provides that if a discovery conference is held, at its close the court shall enter an order respecting the subsequent conduct of discovery. The amendment provides that the sanctions available for violation of other court orders respecting discovery are available for violation of the discovery conference order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Subdivision (e) is stricken. Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;1783 no longer refers to sanctions. The subdivision otherwise duplicates Rule 45(e)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. New Rule 26(f) imposes a duty on parties to participate in good faith in the framing of a discovery plan by agreement upon the request of any party. This subdivision authorizes the court to award to parties who participate in good faith in an attempt to frame a discovery plan the expenses incurred in the attempt if any party or his attorney fails to participate in good faith and thereby causes additional expense.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Failure of United States to Participate in Good Faith in Discovery</em>. Rule 37 authorizes the court to direct that parties or attorneys who fail to participate in good faith in the discovery process pay the expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by other parties as a result of that failure. Since attorneys&rsquo; fees cannot ordinarily be awarded against the United States (28 U.S.C. &sect;2412), there is often no practical remedy for the misconduct of its officers and attorneys. However, in the case of a government attorney who fails to participate in good faith in discovery, nothing prevents a court in an appropriate case from giving written notification of that fact to the Attorney General of the United States and other appropriate heads of offices or agencies thereof.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This subdivision is revised to reflect the revision of Rule 26(a), requiring disclosure of matters without a discovery request.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to new subdivision (a)(2)(A), a party dissatisfied with the disclosure made by an opposing party may under this rule move for an order to compel disclosure. In providing for such a motion, the revised rule parallels the provisions of the former rule dealing with failures to answer particular interrogatories. Such a motion may be needed when the information to be disclosed might be helpful to the party seeking the disclosure but not to the party required to make the disclosure. If the party required to make the disclosure would need the material to support its own contentions, the more effective enforcement of the disclosure requirement will be to exclude the evidence not disclosed, as provided in subdivision (c)(1) of this revised rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Language is included in the new paragraph and added to the subparagraph (B) that requires litigants to seek to resolve discovery disputes by informal means before filing a motion with the court. This requirement is based on successful experience with similar local rules of court promulgated pursuant to Rule 83.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of paragraph (2) is moved into paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under revised paragraph (3), evasive or incomplete disclosures and responses to interrogatories and production requests are treated as failures to disclose or respond. Interrogatories and requests for production should not be read or interpreted in an artificially restrictive or hypertechnical manner to avoid disclosure of information fairly covered by the discovery request, and to do so is subject to appropriate sanctions under subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised paragraph (4) is divided into three subparagraphs for ease of reference, and in each the phrase &ldquo;after opportunity for hearing&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;after affording an opportunity to be heard&rdquo; to make clear that the court can consider such questions on written submissions as well as on oral hearings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (A) is revised to cover the situation where information that should have been produced without a motion to compel is produced after the motion is filed but before it is brought on for hearing. The rule also is revised to provide that a party should not be awarded its expenses for filing a motion that could have been avoided by conferring with opposing counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (C) is revised to include the provision that formerly was contained in subdivision (a)(2) and to include the same requirement of an opportunity to be heard that is specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The revision provides a self-executing sanction for failure to make a disclosure required by Rule 26(a), without need for a motion under subdivision (a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) prevents a party from using as evidence any witnesses or information that, without substantial justification, has not been disclosed as required by Rules 26(a) and 26(e)(1). This automatic sanction pro<!-- PDFPage:214 -->vides a strong inducement for disclosure of material that the disclosing party would expect to use as evidence, whether at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion, such as one under Rule 56. As disclosure of evidence offered solely for impeachment purposes is not required under those rules, this preclusion sanction likewise does not apply to that evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Limiting the automatic sanction to violations &ldquo;without substantial justification,&rdquo; coupled with the exception for violations that are &ldquo;harmless,&rdquo; is needed to avoid unduly harsh penalties in a variety of situations: <em>e.g</em>., the inadvertent omission from a Rule 26(a)(1)(A) disclosure of the name of a potential witness known to all parties; the failure to list as a trial witness a person so listed by another party; or the lack of knowledge of a pro se litigant of the requirement to make disclosures. In the latter situation, however, exclusion would be proper if the requirement for disclosure had been called to the litigant's attention by either the court or another party.</p>
<p class="note-body">Preclusion of evidence is not an effective incentive to compel disclosure of information that, being supportive of the position of the opposing party, might advantageously be concealed by the disclosing party. However, the rule provides the court with a wide range of other sanctions&mdash;such as declaring specified facts to be established, preventing contradictory evidence, or, like spoliation of evidence, allowing the jury to be informed of the fact of nondisclosure&mdash;that, though not self-executing, can be imposed when found to be warranted after a hearing. The failure to identify a witness or document in a disclosure statement would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence under the same principles that allow a party's interrogatory answers to be offered against it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This subdivision is revised to require that, where a party fails to file any response to interrogatories or a Rule 34 request, the discovering party should informally seek to obtain such responses before filing a motion for sanctions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of this subdivision is revised to clarify that it is the pendency of a motion for protective order that may be urged as an excuse for a violation of subdivision (d). If a party's motion has been denied, the party cannot argue that its subsequent failure to comply would be justified. In this connection, it should be noted that the filing of a motion under Rule 26(c) is not self-executing&mdash;the relief authorized under that rule depends on obtaining the court's order to that effect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. This subdivision is modified to conform to the revision of Rule 26(f).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(1)</em>. When this subdivision was added in 1993 to direct exclusion of materials not disclosed as required, the duty to supplement discovery responses pursuant to Rule 26(e)(2) was omitted. In the face of this omission, courts may rely on inherent power to sanction for failure to supplement as required by Rule 26(e)(2), <em>see</em> 8 <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;2050 at 607&ndash;09, but that is an uncertain and unregulated ground for imposing sanctions. There is no obvious occasion for a Rule 37(a) motion in connection with failure to supplement, and ordinarily only Rule 37(c)(1) exists as rule-based authority for sanctions if this supplementation obligation is violated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment explicitly adds failure to comply with Rule 26(e)(2) as a ground for sanctions under Rule 37(c)(1), including exclusion of withheld materials. The rule provides that this sanction power only applies when the failure to supplement was &ldquo;without substantial justification.&rdquo; Even if the failure was not substantially justified, a party should be allowed to use the material that was not disclosed if the lack of earlier notice was harmless.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Shall&rdquo; is replaced by &ldquo;is&rdquo; under the program to conform amended rules to current style conventions when there is no ambiguity.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report</em>. The Advisory Committee recommends that the published amendment proposal be modified to state that the exclusion sanction can apply to failure &ldquo;to amend a prior response to discovery as required by Rule 26(e)(2).&rdquo; In addition, one minor phrasing change is recommended for the Committee Note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2006 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. Subdivision (f) is new. It focuses on a distinctive feature of computer operations, the routine alteration and deletion of information that attends ordinary use. Many steps essential to computer operation may alter or destroy information, for reasons that have nothing to do with how that information might relate to litigation. As a result, the ordinary operation of computer systems creates a risk that a party may lose potentially discoverable information without culpable conduct on its part. Under Rule 37(f), absent exceptional circumstances, sanctions cannot be imposed for loss of electronically stored information resulting from the routine, good-faith operation of an electronic information system.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37(f) applies only to information lost due to the &ldquo;routine operation of an electronic information system&rdquo;&mdash;the ways in which such systems are generally designed, programmed, and implemented to meet the party's technical and business needs. The &ldquo;routine operation&rdquo; of computer systems includes the alteration and overwriting of information, often without the operator's specific direction or awareness, a feature with no direct counterpart in hard-copy documents. Such features are essential to the operation of electronic information systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 37(f) applies to information lost due to the routine operation of an information system only if the operation was in good faith. Good faith in the routine operation of an information system may involve a party's intervention to modify or suspend certain features of that routine operation to prevent the loss of information, if that information is subject to a preservation obligation. A preservation obligation may arise from many sources, including common law, statutes, regulations, or a court order in the case. The good faith requirement of Rule 37(f) means that a party is not permitted to exploit the routine operation of an information system to thwart discovery obligations by allowing that operation to continue in order to destroy specific stored information that it is required to preserve. When a party is under a duty to preserve information because of pending or reasonably anticipated litigation, intervention in the routine operation of an information system is one aspect of what is often called a &ldquo;litigation hold.&rdquo; Among the factors that bear on a party's good faith in the routine operation of an information system are the steps the party took to comply with a court order in the case or party agreement requiring preservation of specific electronically stored information.</p>
<p class="note-body">Whether good faith would call for steps to prevent the loss of information on sources that the party believes are not reasonably accessible under Rule 26(b)(2) depends on the circumstances of each case. One factor is whether the party reasonably believes that the information on such sources is likely to be discoverable and not available from reasonably accessible sources.</p>
<p class="note-body">The protection provided by Rule 37(f) applies only to sanctions &ldquo;under these rules.&rdquo; It does not affect other sources of authority to impose sanctions or rules of professional responsibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule restricts the imposition of &ldquo;sanctions.&rdquo; It does not prevent a court from making the kinds of adjustments frequently used in managing discovery if a party is unable to provide relevant responsive information. For example, a court could order the responding party to produce an additional witness for deposition, respond to additional interrogatories, or make similar attempts to provide substitutes or alternatives for some or all of the lost information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made after Publication and Comment</em>. The published rule barred sanctions only if the party who lost electronically stored information took reasonable steps to preserve the information after it knew or should <!-- PDFPage:215 -->have known the information was discoverable in the action. A footnote invited comment on an alternative standard that barred sanctions unless the party recklessly or intentionally failed to preserve the information. The present proposal establishes an intermediate standard, protecting against sanctions if the information was lost in the &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; operation of an electronic information system. The present proposal carries forward a related element that was a central part of the published proposal&mdash;the information must have been lost in the system's &ldquo;routine operation.&rdquo; The change to a good-faith test made it possible to eliminate the reference to information &ldquo;discoverable in the action,&rdquo; removing a potential source of confusion as to the duty to preserve information on sources that are identified as not reasonably accessible under Rule 26(b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">The change to a good-faith standard is accompanied by addition of a provision that permits sanctions for loss of information in good- faith routine operation in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances.&rdquo; This provision recognizes that in some circumstances a court should provide remedies to protect an entirely innocent party requesting discovery against serious prejudice arising from the loss of potentially important information.</p>
<p class="note-body">As published, the rule included an express exception that denied protection if a party &ldquo;violated an order in the action requiring it to preserve electronically stored information.&rdquo; This exception was deleted for fear that it would invite routine applications for preservation orders, and often for overbroad orders. The revised Committee Note observes that violation of an order is an element in determining whether a party acted in good faith.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised proposal broadens the rule's protection by applying to operation of &ldquo;an&rdquo; electronic information system, rather than &ldquo;the party's&rdquo; system. The change protects a party who has contracted with an outside firm to provide electronic information storage, avoiding potential arguments whether the system can be characterized as &ldquo;the party's.&rdquo; The party remains obliged to act in good faith to avoid loss of information in routine operations conducted by the outside firm.</p>
