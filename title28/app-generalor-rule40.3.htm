<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> The Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980, 28 U.S.C. &sect;372(c)(18), directs the United States Court of Federal Claims to prescribe rules for the filing of complaints against judges of the court who have engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the court or who are unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> A copy of these rules, titled &ldquo;Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims Governing Complaints of Judicial Misconduct and Disability,&rdquo; is available upon request from the Office of the Clerk of the United States Court of Federal Claims, 717 Madison Place, NW, Washington, DC 20005. Pursuant to these rules, written complaints may be filed with the clerk.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 40.3 has no FRCP counterpart. However, the notice provided by the rule is in accordance with the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States, urging that such notice be made part of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule replaces former Appendix B (&ldquo;Procedures for Processing Complaints of Judicial Misconduct&rdquo;) and its supplementing order, General Order No. 34 dated June 3, 1993. Inclusion of the rule as a subpart of RCFC 40 is intended to further a more coherent organizational structure for the court's rules.</p>
