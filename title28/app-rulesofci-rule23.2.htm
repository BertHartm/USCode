<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">An action brought by or against the members of an unincorporated association as a class by naming certain members as representative parties may be maintained only if it appears that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the association and its members. In the conduct of the action the court may make appropriate orders corresponding with those described in Rule 23(d), and the procedure for dismissal or compromise of the action shall correspond with that provided in Rule 23(e).</p>

<p class="note-body">Although an action by or against representatives of the membership of an unincorporated association has often been viewed as a class action, the real or main purpose of this characterization has been to give &ldquo;entity treatment&rdquo; to the association when for formal reasons it cannot sue or be sued as a jural person under Rule 17(b). See Louisell & Hazard, <em>Pleading and Procedure: State and Federal</em> 718 (1962); 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, par. 23.08 (2d ed. 1963); Story, J. in <em>West v. Randall</em>, 29 Fed.Cas. 718, 722&ndash;23, No. 17,424 (C.C.D.R.I. 1820); and, for examples, <em>Gibbs v. Buck</em>, 307 U.S. 66 (1939); <em>Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive F. & E</em>., 148 F.2d 403 (4th Cir. 1945); <em>Oskoian v. Canuel</em>, 269 F.2d 311 (1st Cir. 1959). Rule 23.2 deals separately with these actions, referring where appropriate to Rule 23.</p>
