<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Responses and Objections.</strong> Unless otherwise provided in these rules or by order of the court, responses or objections to written motions shall be filed within 14 days after service of the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Replies.</strong> Replies to responses or objections shall be filed within 7 days after service of the response or objection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Motions Under RCFC 12(b), 12(c), 56 and 56.1.</strong> Responses to these motions shall be filed within 28 days after service of the motion and replies thereto within 14 days of the service of the response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Leave of Court.</strong> If the subject filing is pursuant to leave of court on motion by a party, time for any response runs from the date of filing and not the date of service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Cross-motions.</strong> Where the responding party files a cross-motion, it shall be contained in the same document as the response to the original motion; the response to the cross-motion shall be contained in the same document as the reply subject to page limitations in RCFC 5.2(b)(2). Where a cross-motion is filed, the parties shall have the same times to respond and to reply to the cross-motion as to an original motion.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 7.1 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 83.2. The renumbering of RCFC 83.2 is intended to reflect its more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules.</p>
