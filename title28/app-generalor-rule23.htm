<h3 class="section-head">Rule 23. Class Actions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action.</strong> One or more members of a class may sue as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Class Actions Maintainable.</strong> An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> the United States has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. Matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by members of the class; and (C) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Determination by Order Whether Class Action to be Maintained; Notice; Judgment; Actions Conducted Partially as Class Actions.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained. An order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> In any class action maintained, the court shall direct to the potential members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including notice to all individuals who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice shall advise that (A) the court will include the individual in the class action if the individual so requests by a specified date; and (B) the judgment(s), whether favorable or not, will bind the member(s) of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under subdivisions (b)(1) or (b)(2), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and specify or describe those to whom the notice provided in subdivision (c)(2) was directed, and who have requested inclusion, and whom the court finds to be members of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> When appropriate, (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Orders in Conduct of Actions.</strong> In the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders: (1) determining the course of proceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument; (2) requiring, for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct to some or all of the members of any step in the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come into the action; (3) imposing conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors; (4) requiring that the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent persons, and that the action proceed accordingly; (5) dealing with similar procedural matters. The orders may be combined with an order under RCFC 16, and may be altered or amended as may be desirable from time to time.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:406 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Dismissal or Compromise.</strong> A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Appeals.</strong> [Not used.]</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 23 was completely rewritten. Although the court's rule is modeled largely on the comparable federal rule, there are significant differences between the two rules. In the main, the court's rule adopts the criteria for certifying and maintaining a class action as set forth in <em>Quinault Allottee Ass'n v. United States</em>, 197 Ct. Cl. 134, 453 F.2d 1272 (1972).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the relief available in this court is generally confined to individual money claims against the United States, the situations justifying the use of a class action are correspondingly narrower than those addressed in FRCP 23. Thus, the court's rule does not accommodate, <em>inter alia</em>, the factual situations redressable through declaratory and injunctive relief contemplated under FRCP (b)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Additionally, unlike the federal rule, the court's rule contemplates only opt-in class certifications, not opt-out classes. The latter were viewed as inappropriate here because of the need for specificity in money judgments against the United States, and the fact that the court's injunctive powers&mdash;the typical focus of an opt-out class&mdash;are more limited than those of a district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the court's rule does not contain a provision comparable to FRCP 23(f). That subdivision, which provides that a &ldquo;court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. granting or denying class certification&rdquo; has its origin in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(e), which authorizes the Supreme Court to promulgate rules that provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision other than those set out in Section 1292. Because no comparable statutory authority exists for this court's promulgation of a similar rule, subdivision (f) was omitted. It should be noted, however, that the Court of Federal Claims may certify questions to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1292(b) and 1295.</p>
