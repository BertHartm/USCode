<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">In this 2002 revision, the court has endeavored to create a set of rules that conforms to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as amended through November 30, 2001, to the extent practicable given differences in jurisdiction between the United States district courts and the United States Court of Federal Claims. Consistent with this objective, interpretation of the court's rules will be guided by case law and the Advisory Committee Notes that accompany the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court's own Rules Committee Notes are intended primarily to state the source of a given rule but in some instances also provide interpretive guidance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Future revisions to these rules will be posted on the court's website at www.uscfc.uscourts.gov.</p>
