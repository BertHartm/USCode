<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;dismissed for want of jurisdiction&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said district court&rdquo;. The substituted language is sufficient. (See reviser's note under section 1359 of this title.)
