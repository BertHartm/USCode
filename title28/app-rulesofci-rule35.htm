<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Order for Examination</cap-smallcap>. When the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party's custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Report of Examiner.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If requested by the party against whom an order is made under Rule 35(a) or the person examined, the party causing the examination to be made shall deliver to the requesting party a copy of the detailed written report of the examiner setting out the examiner's findings, including results of all tests made, diagnoses and conclusions, together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. After delivery the party causing the examination shall be entitled upon request to receive from the party against whom the order is made a like report of any examination, previously or thereafter made, of the same condition, unless, in the case of a report of examination of a person not a party, the party shows that the party is unable to obtain it. The court on motion may make an order against a party requiring delivery of a report on such terms as are just, and if an examiner fails or refuses to make a report the court may exclude the examiner's testimony if offered at trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) By requesting and obtaining a report of the examination so ordered or by taking the deposition of the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege the party may have in that action or any other involving the same controversy, regarding the testimony of every other person who has examined or may thereafter examine the party in respect of the same mental or physical condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) This subdivision applies to examinations made by agreement of the parties, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. This subdivision does not preclude discovery of a report of an examiner or the taking of a deposition of the examiner in accordance with the provisions of any other rule.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">Physical examination of parties before trial is authorized by statute or rule in a number of states. See <!-- PDFPage:185 -->Ariz.Rev.Code Ann. (Struckmeyer, 1928) &sect;4468; Mich.Court Rules Ann. (Searl, 1933) Rule 41, &sect;2; 2 N.J.Comp.Stat. (1910), N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;306; 1 S.D.Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;2716A; 3 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;1230&ndash;1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Mental examination of parties is authorized in Iowa. Iowa Code (1935) ch. 491&ndash;F1. See McCash, <em>The Evolution of the Doctrine of Discovery and Its Present Status in Iowa</em>, 20 Ia.L.Rev. 68 (1934).</p>
<p class="note-body">The constitutionality of legislation providing for physical examination of parties was sustained in <em>Lyon v. Manhattan Railway Co</em>., 142 N.Y. 298, 37 N.E. 113 (1894), and <em>McGovern v. Hope</em>, 63 N.J.L. 76, 42 Atl. 830 (1899). In <em>Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Botsford</em>, 141 U.S. 250 (1891), it was held that the court could not order the physical examination of a party in the absence of statutory authority. But in <em>Camden and Suburban Ry. Co. v. Stetson</em>, 177 U.S. 172 (1900) where there was statutory authority for such examination, derived from a state statute made operative by the conformity act, the practice was sustained. Such authority is now found in the present rule made operative by the Act of June 19, 1934, ch. 651, U.S.C., Title 28, &sect;&sect;723b [see 2072] (Rules in actions at law; Supreme Court authorized to make) and 723c [see 2072] (Union of equity and action at law rules; power of Supreme Court).</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Rule 35(a) has hitherto provided only for an order requiring a party to submit to an examination. It is desirable to extend the rule to provide for an order against the party for examination of a person in his custody or under his legal control. As appears from the provisions of amended Rule 37(b)(2) and the comment under that rule, an order to &ldquo;produce&rdquo; the third person imposes only an obligation to use good faith efforts to produce the person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment will settle beyond doubt that a parent or guardian suing to recover for injuries to a minor may be ordered to produce the minor for examination. Further, the amendment expressly includes blood examination within the kinds of examinations that can be ordered under the rule. See <em>Beach v. Beach</em>, 114 F.2d 479 (D.C. Cir. 1940). Provisions similar to the amendment have been adopted in at least 10 States: Calif.Code Civ.Proc. &sect;2032; Ida.R.Civ.P. 35; Ill.S-H Ann. c. 110A, &sect;215; Md.R.P. 420; Mich.Gen. Ct.R. 311; Minn.R.Civ.P. 35; Mo.Vern.Ann.R.Civ.P. 60.01; N.Dak.R.Civ.P. 35; N.Y.C.P.L. &sect;3121; Wyo.R.Civ.P. 35.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment makes no change in the requirements of Rule 35 that, before a court order may issue, the relevant physical or mental condition must be shown to be &ldquo;in controversy&rdquo; and &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; must be shown for the examination. Thus, the amendment has no effect on the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Schlagenhauf v. Holder</em>, 379 U.S. 104 (1964), stressing the importance of these requirements and applying them to the facts of the case. The amendment makes no reference to employees of a party. Provisions relating to employees in the State statutes and rules cited above appear to have been virtually unused.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)</em>. This subdivision is amended to correct an imbalance in Rule 35(b)(1) as heretofore written. Under that text, a party causing a Rule 35(a) examination to be made is required to furnish to the party examined, on request, a copy of the examining physician's report. If he delivers this copy, he is in turn entitled to receive from the party examined reports of all examinations of the same condition previously or later made. But the rule has not in terms entitled the examined party to receive from the party causing the Rule 35(a) examination any reports of earlier examinations of the same condition to which the latter may have access. The amendment cures this defect. See La.Stat.Ann., Civ.Proc. art. 1495 (1960); Utah R.Civ.P.35(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment specifies that the written report of the examining physician includes results of all tests made, such as results of X-rays and cardiograms. It also embodies changes required by the broadening of Rule 35(a) to take in persons who are not parties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3)</em>. This new subdivision removes any possible doubt that reports of examination may be obtained although no order for examination has been made under Rule 35(a). Examinations are very frequently made by agreement, and sometimes before the party examined has an attorney. The courts have uniformly ordered that reports be supplied, see 4 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;35.06, n.1 (2d ed. 1966); 2A Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> &sect;823, n. 22 (Wright ed. 1961), and it appears best to fill the technical gap in the present rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision also makes clear that reports of examining physicians are discoverable not only under Rule 35(b) but under other rules as well. To be sure, if the report is privileged, then discovery is not permissible under any rule other than Rule 35(b) and it is permissible under Rule 35(b) only if the party requests a copy of the report of examination made by the other party's doctor. <em>Sher v. De Haven</em>, 199 F.2d 777 (D.C. Cir. 1952), <em>cert. denied</em> 345 U.S. 936 (1953). But if the report is unprivileged and is subject to discovery under the provisions of rules other than Rule 35(b)&mdash;such as Rules 34 or 26(b)(3) or (4)&mdash;discovery should not depend upon whether the person examined demands a copy of the report. Although a few cases have suggested the contrary, <em>e.g., Galloway v. National Dairy Products Corp</em>., 24 F.R.D. 362 (E.D.Pa. 1959), the better considered district court decisions hold that Rule 35(b) is not preemptive. <em>E.g., Leszynski v. Russ</em>, 29 F.R.D. 10, 12 (D.Md. 1961) and cases cited. The question was recently given full consideration in <em>Buffington v. Wood</em>, 351 F.2d 292 (3d Cir. 1965), holding that Rule 35(b) is not preemptive.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The revision authorizes the court to require physical or mental examinations conducted by any person who is suitably licensed or certified.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule was revised in 1988 by Congressional enactment to authorize mental examinations by licensed clinical psychologists. This revision extends that amendment to include other certified or licensed professionals, such as dentists or occupational therapists, who are not physicians or clinical psychologists, but who may be well-qualified to give valuable testimony about the physical or mental condition that is the subject of dispute.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the examiner be <em>suitably</em> licensed or certified is a new requirement. The court is thus expressly authorized to assess the credentials of the examiner to assure that no person is subjected to a court-ordered examination by an examiner whose testimony would be of such limited value that it would be unjust to require the person to undergo the invasion of privacy associated with the examination. This authority is not wholly new, for under the former rule, the court retained discretion to refuse to order an examination, or to restrict an examination. 8 WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE &sect;2234 (1986 Supp.). The revision is intended to encourage the exercise of this discretion, especially with respect to examinations by persons having narrow qualifications.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court's responsibility to determine the suitability of the examiner's qualifications applies even to a proposed examination by a physician. If the proposed examination and testimony calls for an expertise that the proposed examiner does not have, it should not be ordered, even if the proposed examiner is a physician. The rule does not, however, require that the license or certificate be conferred by the jurisdiction in which the examination is conducted.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:186 --><h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body">1988&mdash;Subd. (a). Pub. L. 100&ndash;690, &sect;7047(b)(1), substituted &ldquo;physical examination by a physician, or mental examination by a physician or psychologist&rdquo; for &ldquo;physical or mental examination by a physician&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subd. (b). Pub. L. 100&ndash;690, &sect;7047(b)(2), inserted &ldquo;or psychologist&rdquo; in heading, in two places in par. (1), and in two places in par. (3).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subd. (c). Pub. L. 100&ndash;690, &sect;7047(b)(3), added subd. (c).</p>
