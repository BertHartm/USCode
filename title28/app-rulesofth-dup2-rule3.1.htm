<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notice to Interested Parties. On the same day as the filing of a request for transfer, the party requesting transfer shall serve a copy of the request, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon every interested party who was a party to the panel or committee review, except if the time period for filing the Notice of Appearance under NAFTA Article 1904 Panel Rule 40 or NAFTA Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rule 40 has not expired, then service shall be upon every interested party who was a party to the administrative proceeding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Pleadings. Notwithstanding Rule 7(a) of these rules, in an action transferred to the court under 19 U.S.C. &sect;1516a(g)(12) in which the plaintiff has filed a complaint under NAFTA Article 1904 Panel Rule 39, the plaintiff shall not file a new complaint in the action before the court, except that</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) if the time for amending a complaint in the panel proceedings had not expired or was stayed prior to the filing of the request for transfer, the plaintiff may file an amended complaint within the additional time that remained for filing an amended complaint in the panel proceedings, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) in all actions, the plaintiff may amend the complaint within 10 days of the date of filing of the request for transfer to allege counts or requests for relief that could not have been alleged before the panel.</p>
