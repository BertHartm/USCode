<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Dismissal in the Court of Appeals.</cap-smallcap> The circuit clerk may dismiss a docketed appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees that are due. But no mandate or other process may issue without a court order. An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant's motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the court.</p>
