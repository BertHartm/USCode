<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;341, 371(7), (8) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;233, 256, 36 Stat. 1156, 1160; Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 97, &sect;2, 40 Stat. 395; June 10, 1922, ch. 216, &sect;2, 42 Stat. 635).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section reconciles provisions of sections 341 and 371(7), (8) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with Article 3, section 2 and Amendment 11 of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 341 and 371 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were not wholly consistent with such constitutional provisions. Said section 341 provided that the Supreme Court should have original jurisdiction of controversies between a State and citizens of other States or aliens, whereas the 11th Amendment prohibits an action in any Federal Court against a State by citizens of another State or aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">The original jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 3, section 2, of the Constitution is not exclusive by virtue of that provision alone. Congress may provide for or deny exclusiveness. <em>Ames v. Kansas</em>, 1884, 4 S.Ct. 437, 111 U.S. 449, 28 L.Ed. 442; <em>U.S. v. 4,450.72 Acres of Land, Clearwater County, State of Minnesota</em>, D.C. Minn., 1939, 27 F.Supp. 167, affirmed 125 F.2d 636.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 341 and 371 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not confer expressly exclusive jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in civil cases between States, <em>Louisiana v. Texas</em>, 1899, 20 S.Ct. 251, 176 U.S. 1, 44 L.Ed. 347, as has been provided in subsection (a)(1) of the revised section. The language at the beginning of said section 341, for which said subsection has been substituted, was ambiguous and made it appear that an action by a State against the United States would be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, in <em>U.S. v. Louisiana</em>, 1887, 8 S.Ct. 17, 123 U.S. 32, 31 L.Ed. 69, the Supreme Court, in a case appealed from the Court of Claims, held to the contrary.</p>
<p class="note-body">So, also, in actions by the United States to condemn lands of a State or to enforce penalties for violation of a Federal statute against a State-owned utility, the United States district courts have jurisdiction. See <em>United States v. State of Utah</em>, 1931, 51 S.Ct. 438, 283 U.S. 64, 75 L.Ed. 844; <em>United States v. 4,450.72 Acres of Land, Clearwater County, State of Minnesota</em>, D.C.Minn. 1939, 27 F.Supp. 167, affirmed 125 F.2d 636; <em>United States v. State of California</em>, 1936, 56 S.Ct. 421, 297 U.S. 175, 80 L.Ed. 567.</p>
<p class="note-body">The intent of section 371(7), (8) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States should be exclusive of the courts of the States in controversies to which a State is a party, and suits against ambassadors, public ministers, consuls and vice consuls, is preserved and clarified by this section and section 1351 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section preserves existing law with reference to foreign ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls. Under subsection (a)(2) the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction of actions or proceedings against the ambassadors or public ministers of other nations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (b)(1) the Supreme Court has original but not exclusive jurisdiction of actions or proceedings brought by such ambassadors or other public ministers or to which consuls or vice consuls of other nations are parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1351 of this title gives to United States district courts, exclusive of the courts of the States, jurisdiction of civil actions against such consuls and vice consuls.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section and said section 1351 of this title have no application to ambassadors, public ministers, consuls or vice consuls representing the United States. See <em>Mil<!-- PDFPage:311 -->ward v. McSaul</em>, D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1846, 17 Fed.Cas.No. 9,623 and <em>State of Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Alger</em>, 1930, 50 S.Ct. 154, 280 U.S. 379, 74 L.Ed. 489.</p>

<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 344 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to procedure for review of decisions of State courts are incorporated in section 2103 of this title. Other provisions of such section 344 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 2106 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section applies in both civil and criminal cases. In <em>Twitchell v. Philadelphia</em>, 1868, 7 Wall. 321, 19 L.Ed. 223, it was expressly held that the provisions of section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 85, on which title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;344, is based, applied to criminal cases, and many other Supreme Court decisions impliedly involve the same holding inasmuch as the Court has taken jurisdiction of criminal cases on appeal from State courts. See, for example, <em>Herndon v. Georgia</em>, 1935, 55 S.Ct. 794, 295 U.S. 441, 79 L.Ed. 1530 and <em>Ashcraft v. Tennessee</em>, 1944, 64 S.Ct. 921, 322 U.S. 143, 88 L.Ed. 1192.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision, in section 344(b) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for review and determination on certiorari &ldquo;with the same power and authority and with like effect as if brought up by appeal&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary. The scope of review under this section is unrestricted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and the power to review under this paragraph may be exercised as well where the Federal claim is sustained as where it is denied,&rdquo; in said section 344(b), were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence in said section 344(b) relating to the right to relief under both subsections of said section 344, was omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
