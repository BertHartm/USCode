<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">Introductory Note: The Hearsay Problem</h4>
<p class="note-body">The factors to be considered in evaluating the testimony of a witness are perception, memory, and narration. Morgan, Hearsay Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay Concept, 62 Harv.L.Rev. 177 (1948), Selected Writings on Evidence and Trial 764, 765 (Fryer ed. 1957); Shientag, Cross-Examination&mdash;A Judge's Viewpoint, 3 Record 12 (1948); Strahorn, A Reconsideration of the Hearsay Rule and Admissions, 85 U.Pa.L.Rev. 484, 485 (1937), Selected Writings, <em>supra</em>, 756, 757: Weinstein, Probative Force of Hearsay, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 331 (1961). Sometimes a fourth is added, sincerity, but in fact it seems merely to be an aspect of the three already mentioned.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to encourage the witness to do his best with respect to each of these factors, and to expose any inaccuracies which may enter in, the Anglo-American tradition has evolved three conditions under which witnesses will ideally be required to testify: (1) under oath, (2) in the personal presence of the trier of fact, (3) subject to cross-examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Standard procedure calls for the swearing of witnesses. While the practice is perhaps less effective than in an earlier time, no disposition to relax the requirement is apparent, other than to allow affirmation by persons with scruples against taking oaths.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The demeanor of the witness traditionally has been believed to furnish trier and opponent with valuable clues. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B</em>., 340 U.S. 474, 495&ndash;496, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); Sahm, Demeanor Evidence: Elusive and Intangible Imponderables, 47 A.B.A.J. 580 (1961), quoting numerous authorities. The witness himself will probably be impressed with the solemnity of the occasion and the possibility of public disgrace. Willingness to falsify may reasonably become more difficult in the presence of the person against whom directed. Rules 26 and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal and Civil Procedure, respectively, include the general requirement that testimony be taken orally in open court. The Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is a manifestation of these beliefs and attitudes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Emphasis on the basis of the hearsay rule today tends to center upon the condition of cross-examination. All may not agree with Wigmore that cross-examination is &ldquo;beyond doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth,&rdquo; but all will agree with his statement that it has become a &ldquo;vital feature&rdquo; of the Anglo-American system. 5 Wigmore &sect;1367, p. 29. The belief, or perhaps hope, that cross-examination is effective in exposing imperfections of perception, memory, and narration is fundamental. Morgan, Foreword to Model Code of Evidence 37 (1942).</p>
<p class="note-body">The logic of the preceding discussion might suggest that no testimony be received unless in full compliance with the three ideal conditions. No one advocates this position. Common sense tells that much evidence which is not given under the three conditions may be inherently superior to much that is. Moreover, when the choice is between evidence which is less than best and no evidence at all, only clear folly would dictate an across-the-board policy of doing without. The problem thus resolves itself into effecting a sensible accommodation between these considerations and the desirability of giving testimony under the ideal conditions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The solution evolved by the common law has been a general rule excluding hearsay but subject to numerous exceptions under circumstances supposed to furnish guarantees of trustworthiness. Criticisms of this scheme are that it is bulky and complex, fails to screen good from bad hearsay realistically, and inhibits the growth of the law of evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since no one advocates excluding all hearsay, three possible solutions may be considered: (1) abolish the rule against hearsay and admit all hearsay; (2) admit hearsay possessing sufficient probative force, but with procedural safeguards; (3) revise the present system of class exceptions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Abolition of the hearsay rule would be the simplest solution. The effect would not be automatically to abolish the giving of testimony under ideal conditions. If the declarant were available, compliance with the ideal conditions would be optional with either party. Thus the proponent could call the declarant as a witness as a form of presentation more impressive than his hearsay statement. Or the opponent could call the declarant to be cross-examined upon his statement. This is the tenor of Uniform Rule 63(1), admitting the hearsay declaration of a person &ldquo;who is present at the hearing and available for cross-examination.&rdquo; Compare the treatment of declarations of available declarants in Rule 801(d)(1) of the instant rules. If the declarant were unavailable, a rule of free admissibility would make no distinctions in terms of degrees of noncompliance with the ideal conditions and would exact no liquid pro quo in the form of assurances of trustworthiness. Rule 503 of the Model Code did exactly that, providing for the admissibility of any hearsay declaration by an unavailable declarant, finding support in the Massachusetts act of 1898, enacted at the instance of Thayer, Mass.Gen.L.1932, c. 233 &sect;65, and in the English act of 1938, St.1938, c. 28, Evidence. Both are limited to civil cases. The draftsmen of the Uniform Rules chose a less advanced and more conventional position. Comment, Uniform Rule 63. The present Advisory Committee has been unconvinced of the wisdom of abandoning the traditional requirement of some particular assurance of credibility as a condition precedent to admitting the hearsay declaration of an unavailable declarant.</p>
<p class="note-body">In criminal cases, the Sixth Amendment requirement of confrontation would no doubt move into a large part of the area presently occupied by the hearsay rule in the event of the abolition of the latter. The resultant split between civil and criminal evidence is regarded as an undesirable development.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Abandonment of the system of class exceptions in favor of individual treatment in the setting of the particular case, accompanied by procedural safeguards, has been impressively advocated. Weinstein, The Probative Force of Hearsay, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 331 (1961). Admissibility would be determined by weighing the probative force of the evidence against the possibility of prejudice, waste of time, and the availability of more satisfactory evidence. The bases of the traditional hearsay exceptions would be helpful in assessing probative force. Ladd, The Relationship of the Principles of Exclusionary Rules of Evidence to the Problem of Proof, 18 Minn.L.Rev. 506 (1934). Procedural safeguards would consist of notice of intention to use hearsay, free comment by the judge on the weight of the evidence, and a greater measure of authority in both trial and appellate judges to deal with evidence on the basis of weight. The Advisory Committee has rejected this approach to hearsay as involving too great a measure of judicial discretion, minimizing the predictability of rulings, enhancing the difficulties of preparation for trial, adding a further element to the already over-complicated congeries of pre-trial procedures, and requiring substantially different rules for civil and criminal cases. The only way in which the probative force of hearsay differs from the probative force of other testimony is in the absence of oath, demeanor, and cross-examination as aids in determining credibility. For a judge to exclude evidence because he does not believe it has been described as &ldquo;altogether atypical, extraordinary. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; Chadbourn, Bentham and the Hearsay Rule&mdash;A Benthamic View of Rule 63(4)(c) of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 932, 947 (1962).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:406 --><p class="note-body">(3) The approach to hearsay in these rules is that of the common law, i.e., a general rule excluding hearsay, with exceptions under which evidence is not required to be excluded even though hearsay. The traditional hearsay exceptions are drawn upon for the exceptions, collected under two rules, one dealing with situations where availability of the declarant is regarded as immaterial and the other with those where unavailability is made a condition to the admission of the hearsay statement. Each of the two rules concludes with a provision for hearsay statements not within one of the specified exceptions &ldquo;but having comparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.&rdquo; Rules 803(24) and 804(b)(6). This plan is submitted as calculated to encourage growth and development in this area of the law, while conserving the values and experience of the past as a guide to the future.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Confrontation and Due Process</h4>
<p class="note-body">Until very recently, decisions invoking the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment were surprisingly few, a fact probably explainable by the former inapplicability of the clause to the states and by the hearsay rule's occupancy of much the same ground. The pattern which emerges from the earlier cases invoking the clause is substantially that of the hearsay rule, applied to criminal cases: an accused is entitled to have the witnesses against him testify under oath, in the presence of himself and trier, subject to cross-examination; yet considerations of public policy and necessity require the recognition of such exceptions as dying declarations and former testimony of unavailable witnesses. <em>Mattox v. United States</em>, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895); <em>Motes v. United States</em>, 178 U.S. 458, 20 S.Ct. 993, 44 L.Ed. 1150 (1900); <em>Delaney v. United States</em>, 263 U.S. 586, 44 S.Ct. 206, 68 L.Ed. 462 (1924). Beginning with <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts</em>, 291 U.S. 97, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934), the Court began to speak of confrontation as an aspect of procedural due process, thus extending its applicability to state cases and to federal cases other than criminal. The language of <em>Snyder</em> was that of an elastic concept of hearsay. The deportation case of <em>Bridges v. Wixon</em>, 326 U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945), may be read broadly as imposing a strictly construed right of confrontation in all kinds of cases or narrowly as the product of a failure of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to follow its own rules. <em>In re Oliver</em>, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948), ruled that cross-examination was essential to due process in a state contempt proceeding, but in <em>United States v. Nugent</em>, 346 U.S. 1, 73 S.Ct. 991, 97 L.Ed. 1417 (1953), the court held that it was not an essential aspect of a &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; for a conscientious objector under the Selective Service Act. <em>Stein v. New York</em>, 346 U.S. 156, 196, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 97 L.Ed. 1522 (1953), disclaimed any purpose to read the hearsay rule into the Fourteenth Amendment, but in <em>Greene v. McElroy</em>, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959), revocation of security clearance without confrontation and cross-examination was held unauthorized, and a similar result was reached in <em>Willner v. Committee on Character</em>, 373 U.S. 96, 83 S.Ct. 1175, 10 L.Ed.2d 224 (1963). Ascertaining the constitutional dimensions of the confrontation-hearsay aggregate against the background of these cases is a matter of some difficulty, yet the general pattern is at least not inconsistent with that of the hearsay rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">In 1965 the confrontation clause was held applicable to the states. <em>Pointer v. Texas</em>, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). Prosecution use of former testimony given at a preliminary hearing where petitioner was not represented by counsel was a violation of the clause. The same result would have followed under conventional hearsay doctrine read in the light of a constitutional right to counsel, and nothing in the opinion suggests any difference in essential outline between the hearsay rule and the right of confrontation. In the companion case of <em>Douglas v. Alabama</em>, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), however, the result reached by applying the confrontation clause is one reached less readily via the hearsay rule. A confession implicating petitioner was put before the jury by reading it to the witness in portions and asking if he made that statement. The witness refused to answer on grounds of self-incrimination. The result, said the Court, was to deny cross-examination, and hence confrontation. True, it could broadly be said that the confession was a hearsay statement which for all practical purposes was put in evidence. Yet a more easily accepted explanation of the opinion is that its real thrust was in the direction of curbing undesirable prosecutorial behavior, rather than merely applying rules of exclusion, and that the confrontation clause was the means selected to achieve this end. Comparable facts and a like result appeared in <em>Brookhart v. Janis</em>, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body">The pattern suggested in <em>Douglas</em> was developed further and more distinctly in a pair of cases at the end of the 1966 term. <em>United States v. Wade</em>, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and <em>Gilbert v. California</em>, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), hinged upon practices followed in identifying accused persons before trial. This pretrial identification was said to be so decisive an aspect of the case that accused was entitled to have counsel present; a pretrial identification made in the absence of counsel was not itself receivable in evidence and, in addition, might fatally infect a courtroom identification. The presence of counsel at the earlier identification was described as a necessary prerequisite for &ldquo;a meaningful confrontation at trial.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Wade, supra</em>, 388 U.S. at p. 236, 87 S.Ct. at p. 1937. <em>Wade</em> involved no evidence of the fact of a prior identification and hence was not susceptible of being decided on hearsay grounds. In <em>Gilbert</em>, witnesses did testify to an earlier identification, readily classifiable as hearsay under a fairly strict view of what constitutes hearsay. The Court, however, carefully avoided basing the decision on the hearsay ground, choosing confrontation instead. 388 U.S. 263, 272, n. 3, 87 S.Ct. 1951. See also <em>Parker v. Gladden</em>, 385 U.S. 363 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420 (1966), holding that the right of confrontation was violated when the bailiff made prejudicial statements to jurors, and Note, 75, Yale L.J. 1434 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the earlier cases, the confrontation clause may have been little more than a constitutional embodiment of the hearsay rule, even including traditional exceptions but with some room for expanding them along similar lines. But under the recent cases the impact of the clause clearly extends beyond the confines of the hearsay rule. These considerations have led the Advisory Committee to conclude that a hearsay rule can function usefully as an adjunct to the confrontation right in constitutional areas and independently in nonconstitutional areas. In recognition of the separateness of the confrontation clause and the hearsay rule, and to avoid inviting collisions between them or between the hearsay rule and other exclusionary principles, the exceptions set forth in Rules 803 and 804 are stated in terms of exemption from the general exclusionary mandate of the hearsay rule, rather than in positive terms of admissibility. See Uniform Rule 63(1) to (31) and California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1200&ndash;1340.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo; assumes importance because the term is used in the definition of hearsay in subdivision (c). The effect of the definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo; is to exclude from the operation of the hearsay rule all evidence of conduct, verbal or nonverbal, not intended as an assertion. The key to the definition is that nothing is an assertion unless intended to be one.</p>
<p class="note-body">It can scarcely be doubted that an assertion made in words is intended by the declarant to be an assertion. Hence verbal assertions readily fall into the category of &ldquo;statement.&rdquo; Whether nonverbal conduct should be regarded as a statement for purposes of defining hearsay requires further consideration. Some nonverbal conduct, such as the act of pointing to identify a suspect in a lineup, is clearly the equivalent of words, assertive in nature, and to be regarded as a statement. Other nonverbal conduct, however, may be offered as evidence that the person acted as he did because of his belief in the existence of the condition sought to be proved, from which belief the existence of the condition may be inferred. This sequence is, arguably, in effect an assertion of the existence of the condition and hence properly includable within the hearsay concept. See Morgan, Hearsay Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay Concept, 62 Harv.L. Rev. 177, 214, 217 (1948), and the elaboration in Finman, Implied Assertions as Hearsay: Some Criticisms of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, 14 Stan.L.Rev. 682 (1962). Admittedly evidence of this character is untested with respect to the perception, memory, and narration (or their equivalents) of the actor, but the Advisory Committee is of the view that these dangers are minimal in the absence of an intent to assert and do not justify the loss of the evidence on hearsay grounds. No class of evidence is free of the possibility of fabrication, but the likelihood is less with nonverbal than with assertive verbal conduct. The situations giving rise to the nonverbal conduct are such as virtually to eliminate questions of sincerity. Motivation, the nature of the conduct, and the presence or absence of reliance will bear heavily upon the weight to be given the evidence. Falknor, The &ldquo;Hear-Say&rdquo; Rule as a &ldquo;See-Do&rdquo; Rule: Evidence of Conduct, 33 Rocky Mt.L.Rev. 133 (1961). Similar considerations govern nonassertive verbal conduct and verbal conduct which is assertive but offered as a basis for inferring something other than the matter asserted, also excluded from the definition of hearsay by the language of subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">When evidence of conduct is offered on the theory that it is not a statement, and hence not hearsay, a preliminary determination will be required to determine whether an assertion is intended. The rule is so worded as to place the burden upon the party claiming that the intention existed; ambiguous and doubtful cases will be resolved against him and in favor of admissibility. The determination involves no greater difficulty than many other preliminary questions of fact. Maguire, The Hearsay System: Around and Through the Thicket, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 741, 765&ndash;767 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">For similar approaches, see Uniform Rule 62(1); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;225, 1200; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(a); New Jersey Evidence Rule 62(1)</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The definition follows along familiar lines in including only statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. McCormick &sect;225; 5 Wigmore &sect;1361, 6 <em>id</em>. &sect;1766. If the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay. <em>Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp</em>., 181 F.2d 70 (7th Cir. 1950), rev'd on other grounds 340 U.S. 558, 71 S.Ct. 408, 95 L.Ed 534, letters of complaint from customers offered as a reason for cancellation of dealer's franchise, to rebut contention that franchise was revoked for refusal to finance sales through affiliated finance company. The effect is to exclude from hearsay the entire category of &ldquo;verbal acts&rdquo; and &ldquo;verbal parts of an act,&rdquo; in which the statement itself affects the legal rights of the parties or is a circumstance bearing on conduct affecting their rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of hearsay must, of course, be read with reference to the definition of statement set forth in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Testimony given by a witness in the course of court proceedings is excluded since there is compliance with all the ideal conditions for testifying.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Several types of statements which would otherwise literally fall within the definition are expressly excluded from it:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) <em>Prior statement by witness</em>. Considerable controversy has attended the question whether a prior out-of-court statement by a person now available for cross-examination concerning it, under oath and in the presence of the trier of fact, should be classed as hearsay. If the witness admits on the stand that he made the statement and that it was true, he adopts the statement and there is no hearsay problem. The hearsay problem arises when the witness on the stand denies having made the statement or admits having made it but denies its truth. The argument in favor of treating these latter statements as hearsay is based upon the ground that the conditions of oath, cross-examination, and demeanor observation did not prevail at the time the statement was made and cannot adequately be supplied by the later examination. The logic of the situation is troublesome. So far as concerns the oath, its mere presence has never been regarded as sufficient to remove a statement from the hearsay category, and it receives much less emphasis than cross-examination as a truth-compelling device. While strong expressions are <!-- PDFPage:408 -->found to the effect that no conviction can be had or important right taken away on the basis of statements not made under fear of prosecution for perjury, <em>Bridges v. Wixon</em>, 326 U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945), the fact is that, of the many common law exceptions to the hearsay rule, only that for reported testimony has required the statement to have been made under oath. Nor is it satisfactorily explained why cross-examination cannot be conducted subsequently with success. The decisions contending most vigorously for its inadequacy in fact demonstrate quite thorough exploration of the weaknesses and doubts attending the earlier statement. <em>State v. Saporen</em>, 205 Minn. 358, 285 N.W. 898 (1939); <em>Ruhala v. Roby</em>, 379 Mich. 102, 150 N.W.2d 146 (1967); <em>People v. Johnson</em>, 68 Cal.2d 646, 68 Cal.Rptr. 599, 441 P.2d 111 (1968). In respect to demeanor, as Judge Learned Hand observed in <em>Di Carlo v. United States</em>, 6 F.2d 364 (2d Cir. 1925), when the jury decides that the truth is not what the witness says now, but what he said before, they are still deciding from what they see and hear in court. The bulk of the case law nevertheless has been against allowing prior statements of witnesses to be used generally as substantive evidence. Most of the writers and Uniform Rule 63(1) have taken the opposite position.</p>
<p class="note-body">The position taken by the Advisory Committee in formulating this part of the rule is founded upon an unwillingness to countenance the general use of prior prepared statements as substantive evidence, but with a recognition that particular circumstances call for a contrary result. The judgment is one more of experience than of logic. The rule requires in each instance, as a general safeguard, that the declarant actually testify as a witness, and it then enumerates three situations in which the statement is excepted from the category of hearsay. Compare Uniform Rule 63(1) which allows any out-of-court statement of a declarant who is present at the trial and available for cross-examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) Prior inconsistent statements traditionally have been admissible to impeach but not as substantive evidence. Under the rule they are substantive evidence. As has been said by the California Law Revision Commission with respect to a similar provision:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Section 1235 admits inconsistent statements of witnesses because the dangers against which the hearsay rule is designed to protect are largely nonexistent. The declarant is in court and may be examined and cross-examined in regard to his statements and their subject matter. In many cases, the inconsistent statement is more likely to be true than the testimony of the witness at the trial because it was made nearer in time to the matter to which it relates and is less likely to be influenced by the controversy that gave rise to the litigation. The trier of fact has the declarant before it and can observe his demeanor and the nature of his testimony as he denies or tries to explain away the inconsistency. Hence, it is in as good a position to determine the truth or falsity of the prior statement as it is to determine the truth or falsity of the inconsistent testimony given in court. Moreover, Section 1235 will provide a party with desirable protection against the &lsquo;turncoat&rsquo; witness who changes his story on the stand and deprives the party calling him of evidence essential to his case.&rdquo; Comment, California Evidence Code &sect;1235. See also McCormick &sect;39. The Advisory Committee finds these views more convincing than those expressed in <em>People v. Johnson</em>, 68 Cal.2d 646, 68 Cal.Rptr. 599, 441 P.2d 111 (1968). The constitutionality of the Advisory Committee's view was upheld in <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). Moreover, the requirement that the statement be inconsistent with the testimony given assures a thorough exploration of both versions while the witness is on the stand and bars any general and indiscriminate use of previously prepared statements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) Prior consistent statements traditionally have been admissible to rebut charges of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive but not as substantive evidence. Under the rule they are substantive evidence. The prior statement is consistent with the testimony given on the stand, and, if the opposite party wishes to open the door for its admission in evidence, no sound reason is apparent why it should not be received generally.</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) The admission of evidence of identification finds substantial support, although it falls beyond a doubt in the category of prior out-of-court statements. Illustrative are <em>People v. Gould</em>, 54 Cal.2d 621, 7 Cal.Rptr. 273, 354 P.2d 865 (1960); <em>Judy v. State</em>, 218 Md. 168, 146 A.2d 29 (1958); <em>State v. Simmons</em>, 63 Wash.2d 17, 385 P.2d 389 (1963); California Evidence Code &sect;1238; New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(1)(c); N.Y. Code of Criminal Procedure &sect;393&ndash;b. Further cases are found in 4 Wigmore &sect;1130. The basis is the generally unsatisfactory and inconclusive nature of courtroom identifications as compared with those made at an earlier time under less suggestive conditions. The Supreme Court considered the admissibility of evidence of prior identification in <em>Gilbert v. California</em>, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967). Exclusion of lineup identification was held to be required because the accused did not then have the assistance of counsel. Significantly, the Court carefully refrained from placing its decision on the ground that testimony as to the making of a prior out-of-court identification (&ldquo;That's the man&rdquo;) violated either the hearsay rule or the right of confrontation because not made under oath, subject to immediate cross-examination, in the presence of the trier. Instead the Court observed:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;There is a split among the States concerning the admissibility of prior extra-judicial identifications, as independent evidence of identity, both by the witness and third parties present at the prior identification. See 71 ALR2d 449. It has been held that the prior identification is hearsay, and, when admitted through the testimony of the identifier, is merely a prior consistent statement. The recent trend, however, is to admit the prior identification under the exception that admits as substantive evidence a prior communication by a witness who is available for cross-examination at the trial. See 5 ALR2d Later Case Service 1225&ndash;1228. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; 388 U.S. at 272, n. 3, 87 S.Ct. at 1956.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) <em>Admissions</em>. Admissions by a party-opponent are excluded from the category of hearsay on the theory that their admissibility in evidence is the result of the adversary system rather than satisfaction of the conditions of the hearsay rule. Strahorn, A Reconsideration of the Hearsay Rule and Admissions, 85 U.Pa.L.Rev. 484, 564 (1937); Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 265 (1962); 4 Wigmore &sect;1048. No guarantee of trustworthiness is required in the case of an admission. The freedom which admissions have enjoyed from technical demands of searching for an assurance of trustworthiness in some against-interest circumstance, and from the restrictive influences of the opinion rule and the rule requiring firsthand knowledge, when taken with the apparently prevalent satisfaction with the results, calls for generous treatment of this avenue to admissibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule specifies five categories of statements for which the responsibility of a party is considered sufficient to justify reception in evidence against him:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) A party's own statement is the classic example of an admission. If he has a representative capacity and the statement is offered against him in that capacity, no inquiry whether he was acting in the representative capacity in making the statement is required; the statement need only be relevant to represent affairs. To the same effect in California Evidence Code &sect;1220. Compare Uniform Rule 63(7), requiring a statement to be made in a representative capacity to be admissible against a party in a representative capacity.</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) Under established principles an admission may be made by adopting or acquiescing in the statement of another. While knowledge of contents would ordinarily be essential, this is not inevitably so: &ldquo;X is a reliable person and knows what he is talking about.&rdquo; See McCormick &sect;246, p. 527, n. 15. Adoption or acquiescence may be manifested in any appropriate manner. When silence is relied upon, the theory is that the person <!-- PDFPage:409 -->would, under the circumstances, protest the statement made in his presence, if untrue. The decision in each case calls for an evaluation in terms of probable human behavior. In civil cases, the results have generally been satisfactory. In criminal cases, however, troublesome questions have been raised by decisions holding that failure to deny is an admission: the inference is a fairly weak one, to begin with; silence may be motivated by advice of counsel or realization that &ldquo;anything you say may be used against you&rdquo;; unusual opportunity is afforded to manufacture evidence; and encroachment upon the privilege against self-incrimination seems inescapably to be involved. However, recent decisions of the Supreme Court relating to custodial interrogation and the right to counsel appear to resolve these difficulties. Hence the rule contains no special provisions concerning failure to deny in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) No authority is required for the general proposition that a statement authorized by a party to be made should have the status of an admission by the party. However, the question arises whether only statements to third persons should be so regarded, to the exclusion of statements by the agent to the principal. The rule is phrased broadly so as to encompass both. While it may be argued that the agent authorized to make statements to his principal does not speak for him, Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 273 (1962), communication to an outsider has not generally been thought to be an essential characteristic of an admission. Thus a party's books or records are usable against him, without regard to any intent to disclose to third persons. 5 Wigmore &sect;1557. See also McCormick &sect;78, pp. 159&ndash;161. In accord is New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(8)(a). Cf. Uniform Rule 63(8)(a) and California Evidence Code &sect;1222 which limit status as an admission in this regard to statements authorized by the party to be made &ldquo;for&rdquo; him, which is perhaps an ambiguous limitation to statements to third persons. Falknor, Vicarious Admissions and the Uniform Rules, 14 Vand.L. Rev. 855, 860&ndash;861 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">(D) The tradition has been to test the admissibility of statements by agents, as admissions, by applying the usual test of agency. Was the admission made by the agent acting in the scope of his employment? Since few principals employ agents for the purpose of making damaging statements, the usual result was exclusion of the statement. Dissatisfaction with this loss of valuable and helpful evidence has been increasing. A substantial trend favors admitting statements related to a matter within the scope of the agency or employment. <em>Grayson v. Williams</em>, 256 F.2d 61 (10th Cir. 1958); <em>Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines v. Tuller</em>, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 292 F.2d 775, 784 (1961); <em>Martin v. Savage Truck Lines, Inc</em>., 121 F.Supp. 417 (D.D.C. 1054), and numerous state court decisions collected in 4 Wigmore, 1964 Supp., pp. 66&ndash;73, with comments by the editor that the statements should have been excluded as not within scope of agency. For the traditional view see <em>Northern Oil Co. v. Socony Mobile Oil Co</em>., 347 F.2d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 1965) and cases cited therein. Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63(9)(a), Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(i)(1), and New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(9)(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">(E) The limitation upon the admissibility of statements of co-conspirators to those made &ldquo;during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy&rdquo; is in the accepted pattern. While the broadened view of agency taken in item (iv) might suggest wider admissibility of statements of co-conspirators, the agency theory of conspiracy is at best a fiction and ought not to serve as a basis for admissibility beyond that already established. See Levie, Hearsay and Conspiracy, 52 Mich.L.Rev. 1159 (1954); Comment, 25 U.Chi.L.Rev. 530 (1958). The rule is consistent with the position of the Supreme Court in denying admissibility to statements made after the objectives of the conspiracy have either failed or been achieved. <em>Krulewitch v. United States</em>, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949); <em>Wong Sun v. United States</em>, 371 U.S. 471, 490, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). For similarly limited provisions see California Evidence Code &sect;1223 and New Jersey Rule 63(9)(b). Cf. Uniform Rule 63(9)(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Present federal law, except in the Second Circuit, permits the use of prior inconsistent statements of a witness for impeachment only. Rule 801(d)(1) as proposed by the Court would have permitted all such statements to be admissible as substantive evidence, an approach followed by a small but growing number of State jurisdictions and recently held constitutional in <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149 (1970). Although there was some support expressed for the Court Rule, based largely on the need to counteract the effect of witness intimidation in criminal cases, the Committee decided to adopt a compromise version of the Rule similar to the position of the Second Circuit. The Rule as amended draws a distinction between types of prior inconsistent statements (other than statements of identification of a person made after perceiving him which are currently admissible, see <em>United States v. Anderson</em>, 406 F.2d 719, 720 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 967 (1969)) and allows only those made while the declarant was subject to cross-examination at a trial or hearing or in a deposition, to be admissible for their truth. Compare <em>United States v. DeSisto</em>, 329 F.2d 929 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 979 (1964); <em>United States v. Cunningham</em>, 446 F.2d 194 (2nd Cir. 1971) (restricting the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence to those made under oath in a formal proceeding, but not requiring that there have been an opportunity for cross-examination). The rationale for the Committee's decision is that (1) unlike in most other situations involving unsworn or oral statements, there can be no dispute as to whether the prior statement was made; and (2) the context of a formal proceeding, an oath, and the opportunity for cross-examination provide firm additional assurances of the reliability of the prior statement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 801 defines what is and what is not hearsay for the purpose of admitting a prior statement as substantive evidence. A prior statement of a witness at a trial or hearing which is inconsistent with his testimony is, of course, always admissible for the purpose of impeaching the witness&rsquo; credibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">As submitted by the Supreme Court, subdivision (d)(1)(A) made admissible as substantive evidence the prior statement of a witness inconsistent with his present testimony.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House severely limited the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements by adding a requirement that the prior statement must have been subject to cross-examination, thus precluding even the use of grand jury statements. The requirement that the prior statement must have been subject to cross-examination appears unnecessary since this rule comes into play only when the witness testifies in the present trial. At that time, he is on the stand and can explain an earlier position and be cross-examined as to both.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the statement be under oath also appears unnecessary. Notwithstanding the absence of an oath contemporaneous with the statement, the witness, when on the stand, qualifying or denying the prior statement, is under oath. In any event, of all the many recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, only one (former testimony) requires that the out-of-court statement have been made under oath. With respect to the lack of evidence of the demeanor of the witness at the time of the prior statement, it would be difficult to improve upon Judge Learned Hand's observation that when the jury decides that the truth is not what the witness says now but what he said before, they are still deciding from what they see and hear in court [<em>Di Carlo v. U.S</em>., 6 F.2d 364 (2d Cir. 1925)].</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule as submitted by the Court has positive advantages. The prior statement was made nearer in time <!-- PDFPage:410 -->to the events, when memory was fresher and intervening influences had not been brought into play. A realistic method is provided for dealing with the turncoat witness who changes his story on the stand [see Comment, California Evidence Code &sect;1235; McCormick, Evidence, &sect;38 (2nd ed. 1972)].</p>
<p class="note-body">New Jersey, California, and Utah have adopted a rule similar to this one; and Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin have adopted the identical Federal rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">For all of these reasons, we think the House amendment should be rejected and the rule as submitted by the Supreme Court reinstated. [It would appear that some of the opposition to this Rule is based on a concern that a person could be convicted solely upon evidence admissible under this Rule. The Rule, however, is not addressed to the question of the sufficiency of evidence to send a case to the jury, but merely as to its admissibility. Factual circumstances could well arise where, if this were the sole evidence, dismissal would be appropriate].</p>
<p class="note-body">As submitted by the Supreme Court and as passed by the House, subdivision (d)(1)(c) of rule 801 made admissible the prior statement identifying a person made after perceiving him. The committee decided to delete this provision because of the concern that a person could be convicted solely upon evidence admissible under this subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House approved the long-accepted rule that &ldquo;a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy&rdquo; is not hearsay as it was submitted by the Supreme Court. While the rule refers to a coconspirator, it is this committee's understanding that the rule is meant to carry forward the universally accepted doctrine that a joint venturer is considered as a coconspirator for the purposes of this rule even though no conspiracy has been charged. <em>United States v. Rinaldi</em>, 393 F.2d 97, 99 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 393 U.S. 913 (1968); <em>United States v. Spencer</em>, 415 F.2d 1301, 1304 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 801 supplies some basic definitions for the rules of evidence that deal with hearsay. Rule 801(d)(1) defines certain statements as not hearsay. The Senate amendments make two changes in it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill provides that a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement and if the statement is inconsistent with his testimony and was given under oath subject to cross-examination and subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or hearing or in a deposition. The Senate amendment drops the requirement that the prior statement be given under oath subject to cross-examination and subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or hearing or in a deposition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment, so that the rule now requires that the prior inconsistent statement be given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition. The rule as adopted covers statements before a grand jury. Prior inconsistent statements may, of course, be used for impeaching the credibility of a witness. When the prior inconsistent statement is one made by a defendant in a criminal case, it is covered by Rule 801(d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill provides that a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement and the statement is one of identification of a person made after perceiving him. The Senate amendment eliminated this provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 801(d)(2) has been amended in order to respond to three issues raised by <em>Bourjaily v. United States</em>, 483 U.S. 171 (1987). First, the amendment codifies the holding in <em>Bourjaily</em> by stating expressly that a court shall consider the contents of a coconspirator's statement in determining &ldquo;the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered.&rdquo; According to <em>Bourjaily</em>, Rule 104(a) requires these preliminary questions to be established by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, the amendment resolves an issue on which the Court had reserved decision. It provides that the contents of the declarant's statement do not alone suffice to establish a conspiracy in which the declarant and the defendant participated. The court must consider in addition the circumstances surrounding the statement, such as the identity of the speaker, the context in which the statement was made, or evidence corroborating the contents of the statement in making its determination as to each preliminary question. This amendment is in accordance with existing practice. Every court of appeals that has resolved this issue requires some evidence in addition to the contents of the statement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Beckham</em>, 968 F.2d 47, 51 (D.C.Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Sepulveda</em>, 15 F.3d 1161, 1181&ndash;82 (1st Cir. 1993), <em>cert. denied</em>, 114 S.Ct. 2714 (1994); <em>United States v. Daly</em>, 842 F.2d 1380, 1386 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 488 U.S. 821 (1988); <em>United States v. Clark</em>, 18 F.3d 1337, 1341&ndash;42 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 115 S.Ct. 152 (1994); <em>United States v. Zambrana</em>, 841 F.2d 1320, 1344&ndash;45 (7th Cir. 1988); <em>United States v. Silverman</em>, 861 F.2d 571, 577 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>United States v. Gordon</em>, 844 F.2d 1397, 1402 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>United States v. Hernandez</em>, 829 F.2d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied</em>, 485 U.S. 1013 (1988); <em>United States v. Byrom</em>, 910 F.2d 725, 736 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, the amendment extends the reasoning of <em>Bourjaily</em> to statements offered under subdivisions (C) and (D) of Rule 801(d)(2). In <em>Bourjaily</em>, the Court rejected treating foundational facts pursuant to the law of agency in favor of an evidentiary approach governed by Rule 104(a). The Advisory Committee believes it appropriate to treat analogously preliminary questions relating to the declarant's authority under subdivision (C), and the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision (D).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 801</em>. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was substituted for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 19. The second sentence of the committee note was changed accordingly.</p>

These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">Statements falling under the hearsay exclusion provided by Rule 801(d)(2) are no longer referred to as &ldquo;admissions&rdquo; in the title to the subdivision. The term &ldquo;admissions&rdquo; is confusing because not all statements covered by the exclusion are admissions in the colloquial sense&mdash;a statement can be within the exclusion even if it &ldquo;admitted&rdquo; nothing and was not against the party's interest when made. The term &ldquo;admissions&rdquo; also raises confusion in comparison with the Rule 804(b)(3) exception for declarations against interest. No change in application of the exclusion is intended.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Present Sense Impression.</em> A statement describing or explaining an event or condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Excited Utterance.</em> A statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition.</em> A statement of the declarant's then-existing state of mind (such as motive, intent, or plan) or emotional, sensory, or physical condition (such as mental feeling, pain, or bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the validity or terms of the declarant's will.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Statement Made for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment.</em> A statement that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is made for&mdash;and is reasonably pertinent to&mdash;medical diagnosis or treatment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) describes medical history; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Recorded Recollection.</em> A record that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is on a matter the witness once knew about but now cannot recall well enough to testify fully and accurately;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness's memory; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">The exceptions are phrased in terms of nonapplication of the hearsay rule, rather than in positive terms of admissibility, in order to repel any implication that other possible grounds for exclusion are eliminated from consideration.</p>
<p class="note-body">The present rule proceeds upon the theory that under appropriate circumstances a hearsay statement may possess circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to justify nonproduction of the declarant in person at the trial even though he may be available. The theory finds vast support in the many exceptions <!-- PDFPage:413 -->to the hearsay rule developed by the common law in which unavailability of the declarant is not a relevant factor. The present rule is a synthesis of them, with revision where modern developments and conditions are believed to make that course appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">In a hearsay situation, the declarant is, of course, a witness, and neither this rule nor Rule 804 dispenses with the requirement of firsthand knowledge. It may appear from his statement or be inferable from circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 602.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exceptions (1) and (2). In considerable measure these two examples overlap, though based on somewhat different theories. The most significant practical difference will lie in the time lapse allowable between event and statement.</p>
<p class="note-body">The underlying theory of Exception [paragraph] (1) is that substantial contemporaneity of event and statement negative the likelihood of deliberate of conscious misrepresentation. Moreover, if the witness is the declarant, he may be examined on the statement. If the witness is not the declarant, he may be examined as to the circumstances as an aid in evaluating the statement. Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 340&ndash;341 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">The theory of Exception [paragraph] (2) is simply that circumstances may produce a condition of excitement which temporarily stills the capacity of reflection and produces utterances free of conscious fabrication. 6 Wigmore &sect;1747, p. 135. Spontaneity is the key factor in each instance, though arrived at by somewhat different routes. Both are needed in order to avoid needless niggling.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the theory of Exception [paragraph] (2) has been criticized on the ground that excitement impairs accuracy of observation as well as eliminating conscious fabrication, Hutchins and Slesinger, Some Observations on the Law of Evidence: Spontaneous Exclamations, 28 Colum.L.Rev. 432 (1928), it finds support in cases without number. See cases in 6 Wigmore &sect;1750; Annot., 53 A.L.R.2d 1245 (statements as to cause of or responsibility for motor vehicle accident); Annot., 4 A.L.R.3d 149 (accusatory statements by homicide victims). Since unexciting events are less likely to evoke comment, decisions involving Exception [paragraph] (1) are far less numerous. Illustrative are <em>Tampa Elec. Co. v. Getrost</em>, 151 Fla. 558, 10 So.2d 83 (1942); <em>Houston Oxygen Co. v. Davis</em>, 139 Tex. 1, 161 S.W.2d 474 (1942); and cases cited in McCormick &sect;273, p. 585, n. 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">With respect to the <em>time element</em>, Exception [paragraph] (1) recognizes that in many, if not most, instances precise contemporaneity is not possible, and hence a slight lapse is allowable. Under Exception [paragraph] (2) the standard of measurement is the duration of the state of excitement. &ldquo;How long can excitement prevail? Obviously there are no pat answers and the character of the transaction or event will largely determine the significance of the time factor.&rdquo; Slough, Spontaneous Statements and State of Mind, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 224, 243 (1961); McCormick &sect;272, p. 580.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Participation</em> by the declarant is not required: a nonparticipant may be moved to describe what he perceives, and one may be startled by an event in which he is not an actor. Slough, <em>supra</em>; McCormick, <em>supra</em>; 6 Wigmore &sect;1755; Annot., 78 A.L.R.2d 300.</p>
<p class="note-body">Whether <em>proof of the startling event</em> may be made by the statement itself is largely an academic question, since in most cases there is present at least circumstantial evidence that something of a startling nature must have occurred. For cases in which the evidence consists of the condition of the declarant (injuries, state of shock), see <em>Insurance Co. v. Mosely</em>, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.), 397, 19 L.Ed. 437 (1869); <em>Wheeler v. United States</em>, 93 U.S.A.App. D.C. 159, 211 F.2d 19 (1953); cert. denied 347 U.S. 1019, 74 S.Ct. 876, 98 L.Ed. 1140; <em>Wetherbee v. Safety Casualty Co</em>., 219 F.2d 274 (5th Cir. 1955); <em>Lampe v. United States</em>, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 229 F.2d 43 (1956). Nevertheless, on occasion the only evidence may be the content of the statement itself, and rulings that it may be sufficient are described as &ldquo;increasing,&rdquo; Slough, <em>supra</em> at 246, and as the &ldquo;prevailing practice,&rdquo; McCormick &sect;272, p. 579. Illustrative are <em>Armour & Co. v. Industrial Commission</em>, 78 Colo. 569, 243 P. 546 (1926); <em>Young v. Stewart</em>, 191 N.C. 297, 131 S.E. 735 (1926). Moreover, under Rule 104(a) the judge is not limited by the hearsay rule in passing upon preliminary questions of fact.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proof of declarant's perception by his statement presents similar considerations when declarant is identified. <em>People v. Poland</em>, 22 Ill.2d 175, 174 N.E.2d 804 (1961). However, when declarant is an unidentified bystander, the cases indicate hesitancy in upholding the statement alone as sufficient, <em>Garrett v. Howden</em>, 73 N.M. 307, 387 P.2d 874 (1963); <em>Beck v. Dye</em>, 200 Wash. 1, 92 P.2d 1113 (1939), a result which would under appropriate circumstances be consistent with the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Permissible <em>subject matter</em> of the statement is limited under Exception [paragraph] (1) to description or explanation of the event or condition, the assumption being that spontaneity, in the absence of a startling event, may extend no farther. In Exception [paragraph] (2), however, the statement need only &ldquo;relate&rdquo; to the startling event or condition, thus affording a broader scope of subject matter coverage. 6 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1750, 1754. See <em>Sanitary Grocery Co. v. Snead</em>, 67 App.D.C. 129, 90 F.2d 374 (1937), slip-and-fall case sustaining admissibility of clerk's statement, &ldquo;That has been on the floor for a couple of hours,&rdquo; and <em>Murphy Auto Parts Co., Inc. v. Ball</em>, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 416, 249 F.2d 508 (1957), upholding admission, on issue of driver's agency, of his statement that he had to call on a customer and was in a hurry to get home. Quick, Hearsay, Excitement, Necessity and the Uniform Rules: A Reappraisal of Rule 63(4), 6 Wayne L.Rev. 204, 206&ndash;209 (1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63(4)(a) and (b); California Evidence Code &sect;1240 (as to Exception (2) only); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(d)(1) and (2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (3) is essentially a specialized application of Exception [paragraph] (1), presented separately to enhance its usefulness and accessibility. See McCormick &sect;&sect;265, 268.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exclusion of &ldquo;statements of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed&rdquo; is necessary to avoid the virtual destruction of the hearsay rule which would otherwise result from allowing state of mind, provable by a hearsay statement, to serve as the basis for an inference of the happening of the event which produced the state of mind). <em>Shepard v. United States</em>, 290 U.S. 96, 54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196 (1933); Maguire, The Hillmon Case&mdash;Thirty-three Years After, 38 Harv.L.Rev. 709, 719&ndash;731 (1925); Hinton, States of Mind and the Hearsay Rule, 1 U.Chi.L.Rev. 394, 421&ndash;423 (1934). The rule of <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillman</em>, 145 U.S. 285, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706 (1892), allowing evidence of intention as tending to prove the doing of the act intended, is of course, left undisturbed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The carving out, from the exclusion mentioned in the preceding paragraph, of declarations relating to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant's will represents an <em>ad hoc</em> judgment which finds ample reinforcement in the decisions, resting on practical grounds of necessity and expediency rather than logic. McCormick &sect;271, pp. 577&ndash;578; Annot., 34 A.L.R.2d 588, 62 A.L.R.2d 855. A similar recognition of the need for and practical value of this kind of evidence is found in California Evidence Code &sect;1260.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (4). Even those few jurisdictions which have shied away from generally admitting statements of present condition have allowed them if made to a physician for purposes of diagnosis and treatment in view of the patient's strong motivation to be truthful. McCormick &sect;266, p. 563. The same guarantee of trustworthiness extends to statements of past conditions and medical history, made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment. It also extends to statements as to causation, reasonably pertinent to the same purposes, in accord with the current trend, <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Industrial Commission</em>, 2 Ill.2d 590, 119 N.E.2d 224 (1954); McCormick &sect;266, p. 564; New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(12)(c). Statements as to fault would not ordinarily qualify under <!-- PDFPage:414 -->this latter language. Thus a patient's statement that he was struck by an automobile would qualify but not his statement that the car was driven through a red light. Under the exception the statement need not have been made to a physician. Statements to hospital attendants, ambulance drivers, or even members of the family might be included.</p>
<p class="note-body">Conventional doctrine has excluded from the hearsay exception, as not within its guarantee of truthfulness, statements to a physician consulted only for the purpose of enabling him to testify. While these statements were not admissible as substantive evidence, the expert was allowed to state the basis of his opinion, including statements of this kind. The distinction thus called for was one most unlikely to be made by juries. The rule accordingly rejects the limitation. This position is consistent with the provision of Rule 703 that the facts on which expert testimony is based need not be admissible in evidence if of a kind ordinarily relied upon by experts in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (5). A hearsay exception for recorded recollection is generally recognized and has been described as having &ldquo;long been favored by the federal and practically all the state courts that have had occasion to decide the question.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Kelly</em>, 349 F.2d 720, 770 (2d Cir. 1965), citing numerous cases and sustaining the exception against a claimed denial of the right of confrontation. Many additional cases are cited in Annot., 82 A.L.R.2d 473, 520. The guarantee of trustworthiness is found in the reliability inherent in a record made while events were still fresh in mind and accurately reflecting them. <em>Owens v. State</em>, 67 Md. 307, 316, 10 A. 210, 212 (1887).</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal controversy attending the exception has centered, not upon the propriety of the exception itself, but upon the question whether a preliminary requirement of impaired memory on the part of the witness should be imposed. The authorities are divided. If regard be had only to the accuracy of the evidence, admittedly impairment of the memory of the witness adds nothing to it and should not be required. McCormick &sect;277, p. 593; 3 Wigmore &sect;738, p. 76; <em>Jordan v. People</em>, 151 Colo. 133, 376 P.2d 699 (1962), cert. denied 373 U.S. 944, 83 S.Ct. 1553, 10 L.Ed.2d 699; <em>Hall v. State</em>, 223 Md. 158, 162 A.2d 751 (1960); <em>State v. Bindhammer</em>, 44 N.J. 372, 209 A.2d 124 (1965). Nevertheless, the absence of the requirement, it is believed, would encourage the use of statements carefully prepared for purposes of litigation under the supervision of attorneys, investigators, or claim adjusters. Hence the example includes a requirement that the witness not have &ldquo;sufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately.&rdquo; To the same effect are California Evidence Code &sect;1237 and New Jersey Rule 63(1)(b), and this has been the position of the federal courts. <em>Vicksburg & Meridian R.R. v. O'Brien</em>, 119 U.S. 99, 7 S.Ct. 118, 30 L.Ed. 299 (1886); <em>Ahern v. Webb</em>, 268 F.2d 45 (10th Cir. 1959); and see <em>N.L.R.B. v. Hudson Pulp and Paper Corp</em>., 273 F.2d 660, 665 (5th Cir. 1960); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Federal Dairy Co</em>., 297 F.2d 487 (1st Cir. 1962). But cf. <em>United States v. Adams</em>, 385 F.2d 548 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">No attempt is made in the exception to spell out the method of establishing the initial knowledge or the contemporaneity and accuracy of the record, leaving them to be dealt with as the circumstances of the particular case might indicate. Multiple person involvement in the process of observing and recording, as in <em>Rathbun v. Brancatella</em>, 93 N.J.L. 222, 107 A. 279 (1919), is entirely consistent with the exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">Locating the exception at this place in the scheme of the rules is a matter of choice. There were two other possibilities. The first was to regard the statement as one of the group of prior statements of a testifying witness which are excluded entirely from the category of hearsay by Rule 801(d)(1). That category, however, requires that declarant be &ldquo;subject to cross-examination,&rdquo; as to which the impaired memory aspect of the exception raises doubts. The other possibility was to include the exception among those covered by Rule 804. Since unavailability is required by that rule and lack of memory is listed as a species of unavailability by the definition of the term in Rule 804(a)(3), that treatment at first impression would seem appropriate. The fact is, however, that the unavailability requirement of the exception is of a limited and peculiar nature. Accordingly, the exception is located at this point rather than in the context of a rule where unavailability is conceived of more broadly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (6) represents an area which has received much attention from those seeking to improve the law of evidence. The Commonwealth Fund Act was the result of a study completed in 1927 by a distinguished committee under the chairmanship of Professor Morgan. Morgan et al., The Law of Evidence: Some Proposals for its Reform 63 (1927). With changes too minor to mention, it was adopted by Congress in 1936 as the rule for federal courts. 28 U.S.C. &sect;1732. A number of states took similar action. The Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1936 promulgated the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, 9A U.L.A. 506, which has acquired a substantial following in the states. Model Code Rule 514 and Uniform Rule 63(13) also deal with the subject. Difference of varying degrees of importance exist among these various treatments.</p>
<p class="note-body">These reform efforts were largely within the context of business and commercial records, as the kind usually encountered, and concentrated considerable attention upon relaxing the requirement of producing as witnesses, or accounting for the nonproduction of, all participants in the process of gathering, transmitting, and recording information which the common law had evolved as a burdensome and crippling aspect of using records of this type. In their areas of primary emphasis on witnesses to be called and the general admissibility of ordinary business and commercial records, the Commonwealth Fund Act and the Uniform Act appear to have worked well. The exception seeks to preserve their advantages.</p>
<p class="note-body">On the subject of what witnesses must be called, the Commonwealth Fund Act eliminated the common law requirement of calling or accounting for all participants by failing to mention it. <em>United States v. Mortimer</em>, 118 F.2d 266 (2d Cir. 1941); <em>La Porte v. United States</em>, 300 F.2d 878 (9th Cir. 1962); McCormick &sect;290, p. 608. Model Code Rule 514 and Uniform Rule 63(13) did likewise. The Uniform Act, however, abolished the common law requirement in express terms, providing that the requisite foundation testimony might be furnished by &ldquo;the custodian or other qualified witness.&rdquo; Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, &sect;2; 9A U.L.A. 506. The exception follows the Uniform Act in this respect.</p>
<p class="note-body">The element of unusual reliability of business records is said variously to be supplied by systematic checking, by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation. McCormick &sect;&sect;281, 286, 287; Laughlin, Business Entries and the Like, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 276 (1961). The model statutes and rules have sought to capture these factors and to extend their impact by employing the phrase &ldquo;regular course of business,&rdquo; in conjunction with a definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; far broader than its ordinarily accepted meaning. The result is a tendency unduly to emphasize a requirement of routineness and repetitiveness and an insistence that other types of records be squeezed into the fact patterns which give rise to traditional business records. The rule therefore adopts the phrase &ldquo;the course of a regularly conducted activity&rdquo; as capturing the essential basis of the hearsay exception as it has evolved and the essential element which can be abstracted from the various specifications of what is a &ldquo;business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Amplification of the kinds of activities producing admissible records has given rise to problems which conventional business records by their nature avoid. They are problems of the source of the recorded information, of entries in opinion form, of motivation, and of involvement as participant in the matters recorded.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sources of information presented no substantial problem with ordinary business records. All participants, <!-- PDFPage:415 -->including the observer or participant furnishing the information to be recorded, were acting routinely, under a duty of accuracy, with employer reliance on the result, or in short &ldquo;in the regular course of business.&rdquo; If, however, the supplier of the information does not act in the regular course, an essential link is broken; the assurance of accuracy does not extend to the information itself, and the fact that it may be recorded with scrupulous accuracy is of no avail. An illustration is the police report incorporating information obtained from a bystander: the officer qualifies as acting in the regular course but the informant does not. The leading case, <em>Johnson v. Lutz</em>, 253 N.Y. 124, 170 N.E. 517 (1930), held that a report thus prepared was inadmissible. Most of the authorities have agreed with the decision. <em>Gencarella v. Fyfe</em>, 171 F.2d 419 (1st Cir. 1948); <em>Gordon v. Robinson</em>, 210 F.2d 192 (3d Cir. 1954); <em>Standard Oil Co. of California v. Moore</em>, 251 F.2d 188, 214 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 975, 78 S.Ct. 1139, 2 L.Ed.2d 1148; <em>Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc</em>., 249 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.N.Y. 1965); Annot., 69 A.L.R.2d 1148. Cf. <em>Hawkins v. Gorea Motor Express, Inc</em>., 360 F.2d 933 (2d Cir 1966). <em>Contra</em>, 5 Wigmore &sect;1530a, n. 1, pp. 391&ndash;392. The point is not dealt with specifically in the Commonwealth Fund Act, the Uniform Act, or Uniform Rule 63(13). However, Model Code Rule 514 contains the requirement &ldquo;that it was the regular course of that business for one with personal knowledge *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to make such a memorandum or record or to transmit information thereof to be included in such a memorandum or record *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; The rule follows this lead in requiring an informant with knowledge acting in the course of the regularly conducted activity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Entries in the form of opinions were not encountered in traditional business records in view of the purely factual nature of the items recorded, but they are now commonly encountered with respect to medical diagnoses, prognoses, and test results, as well as occasionally in other areas. The Commonwealth Fund Act provided only for records of an &ldquo;act, transaction, occurrence, or event,&rdquo; while the Uniform Act, Model Code Rule 514, and Uniform Rule 63(13) merely added the ambiguous term &ldquo;condition.&rdquo; The limited phrasing of the Commonwealth Fund Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1732, may account for the reluctance of some federal decisions to admit diagnostic entries. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor</em>, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 147 F.2d 297 (1945); <em>Lyles v. United States</em>, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 254 F.2d 725 (1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 961, 78 S.Ct. 997, 2 L.Ed.2d 1067; <em>England v. United States</em>, 174 F.2d 466 (5th Cir. 1949); <em>Skogen v. Dow Chemical Co</em>., 375 F.2d 692 (8th Cir. 1967). Other federal decisions, however, experienced no difficulty in freely admitting diagnostic entries. <em>Reed v. Order of United Commercial Travelers</em>, 123 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1941); <em>Buckminster's Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</em>, 147 F.2d 331 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>Medina v. Erickson</em>, 226 F.2d 475 (9th Cir. 1955); <em>Thomas v. Hogan</em>, 308 F.2d 355 (4th Cir. 1962); <em>Glawe v. Rulon</em>, 284 F.2d 495 (8th Cir. 1960). In the state courts, the trend favors admissibility. <em>Borucki v. MacKenzie Bros. Co</em>., 125 Conn. 92, 3 A.2d 224 (1938); <em>Allen v. St. Louis Public Service Co</em>., 365 Mo. 677, 285 S.W.2d 663, 55 A.L.R.2d 1022 (1956); <em>People v. Kohlmeyer</em>, 284 N.Y. 366, 31 N.E.2d 490 (1940); <em>Weis v. Weis</em>, 147 Ohio St. 416, 72 N.E.2d 245 (1947). In order to make clear its adherence to the latter position, the rule specifically includes both diagnoses and opinions, in addition to acts, events, and conditions, as proper subjects of admissible entries.</p>
<p class="note-body">Problems of the motivation of the informant have been a source of difficulty and disagreement. In <em>Palmer v. Hoffman</em>, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), exclusion of an accident report made by the since deceased engineer, offered by defendant railroad trustees in a grade crossing collision case, was upheld. The report was not &ldquo;in the regular course of business,&rdquo; not a record of the systematic conduct of the business as a business, said the Court. The report was prepared for use in litigating, not railroading. While the opinion mentions the motivation of the engineer only obliquely, the emphasis on records of routine operations is significant only by virtue of impact on motivation to be accurate. Absence of routineness raises lack of motivation to be accurate. The opinion of the Court of Appeals had gone beyond mere lack of motive to be accurate: the engineer's statement was &ldquo;dripping with motivations to misrepresent.&rdquo; <em>Hoffman v. Palmer</em>, 129 F.2d 976, 991 (2d Cir. 1942). The direct introduction of motivation is a disturbing factor, since absence of motivation to misrepresent has not traditionally been a requirement of the rule; that records might be self-serving has not been a ground for exclusion. Laughlin, Business Records and the Like, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 276, 285 (1961). As Judge Clark said in his dissent, &ldquo;I submit that there is hardly a grocer's account book which could not be excluded on that basis.&rdquo; 129 F.2d at 1002. A physician's evaluation report of a personal injury litigant would appear to be in the routine of his business. If the report is offered by the party at whose instance it was made, however, it has been held inadmissible, <em>Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc</em>., 249 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.N.Y. 1965), otherwise if offered by the opposite party, <em>Korte v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co</em>., 191 F.2d 86 (2d Cir. 1951), cert. denied 342 U.S. 868, 72 S.Ct. 108, 96 L.Ed. 652.</p>
<p class="note-body">The decisions hinge on motivation and which party is entitled to be concerned about it. Professor McCormick believed that the doctor's report or the accident report were sufficiently routine to justify admissibility. McCormick &sect;287, p. 604. Yet hesitation must be experienced in admitting everything which is observed and recorded in the course of a regularly conducted activity. Efforts to set a limit are illustrated by <em>Hartzog v. United States</em>, 217 F.2d 706 (4th Cir. 1954), error to admit worksheets made by since deceased deputy collector in preparation for the instant income tax evasion prosecution, and <em>United States v. Ware</em>, 247 F.2d 698 (7th Cir. 1957), error to admit narcotics agents&rsquo; records of purchases. See also Exception [paragraph] (8), <em>infra</em>, as to the public record aspects of records of this nature. Some decisions have been satisfied as to motivation of an accident report if made pursuant to statutory duty, <em>United States v. New York Foreign Trade Zone Operators</em>, 304 F.2d 792 (2d Cir. 1962); <em>Taylor v. Baltimore & O. R. Co</em>., 344 F.2d 281 (2d Cir. 1965), since the report was oriented in a direction other than the litigation which ensued. Cf. <em>Matthews v. United States</em>, 217 F.2d 409 (5th Cir. 1954). The formulation of specific terms which would assure satisfactory results in all cases is not possible. Consequently the rule proceeds from the base that records made in the course of a regularly conducted activity will be taken as admissible but subject to authority to exclude if &ldquo;the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Occasional decisions have reached for enhanced accuracy by requiring involvement as a participant in matters reported. <em>Clainos v. United States</em>, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 163 F.2d 593 (1947), error to admit police records of convictions; <em>Standard Oil Co. of California v. Moore</em>, 251 F.2d 188 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 975, 78 S.Ct. 1139, 2 L.Ed.2d 1148, error to admit employees&rsquo; records of observed business practices of others. The rule includes no requirement of this nature. Wholly acceptable records may involve matters merely observed, e.g. the weather.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form which the &ldquo;record&rdquo; may assume under the rule is described broadly as a &ldquo;memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;data compilation&rdquo; is used as broadly descriptive of any means of storing information other than the conventional words and figures in written or documentary form. It includes, but is by no means limited to, electronic computer storage. The term is borrowed from revised Rule 34(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (7). Failure of a record to mention a matter which would ordinarily be mentioned is satisfactory evidence of its nonexistence. Uniform Rule 63(14), Comment. While probably not hearsay as defined in Rule 801, <em>supra</em>, decisions may be found which class the evidence not only as hearsay but also as not within any exception. In order to set the question at rest in favor of admissibility, it is specifically treated here. McCormick &sect;289, p. 609; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence <!-- PDFPage:416 -->314 (1962); 5 Wigmore &sect;1531; Uniform Rule 63(14); California Evidence Code &sect;1272; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(n); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(14).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (8). Public records are a recognized hearsay exception at common law and have been the subject of statutes without number. McCormick &sect;291. See, for example, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1733, the relative narrowness of which is illustrated by its nonapplicability to nonfederal public agencies, thus necessitating report to the less appropriate business record exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Kay v. United States</em>, 255 F.2d 476 (4th Cir. 1958). The rule makes no distinction between federal and nonfederal offices and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Justification for the exception is the assumption that a public official will perform his duty properly and the unlikelihood that he will remember details independently of the record. <em>Wong Wing Foo v. McGrath</em>, 196 F.2d 120 (9th Cir. 1952), and see <em>Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States</em>, 250 U.S. 123, 39 S.Ct. 407, 63 L.Ed. 889 (1919). As to items (a) and (b), further support is found in the reliability factors underlying records of regularly conducted activities generally. See Exception [paragraph] (6), supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Cases illustrating the admissibility of records of the office's or agency's own activities are numerous. <em>Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States</em>, 250 U.S. 123, 39 S.Ct. 407, 63 L.Ed. 889 (1919), Treasury records of miscellaneous receipts and disbursements; <em>Howard v. Perrin</em>, 200 U.S. 71, 26 S.Ct. 195, 50 I.Ed. 374 (1906), General Land Office records; <em>Ballew v. United States</em>, 160 U.S. 187, 16 S.Ct. 263, 40 L.Ed. 388 (1895), Pension Office records.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Cases sustaining admissibility of records of matters observed are also numerous. <em>United States v. Van Hook</em>, 284 F.2d 489 (7th Cir. 1960), remanded for resentencing 365 U.S. 609, 81 S.Ct. 823, 5 L.Ed.2d 821, letter from induction officer to District Attorney, pursuant to army regulations, stating fact and circumstances of refusal to be inducted; <em>T'Kach v. United States</em>, 242 F.2d 937 (5th Cir. 1957), affidavit of White House personnel officer that search of records showed no employment of accused, charged with fraudulently representing himself as an envoy of the President; <em>Minnehaha County v. Kelley</em>, 150 F.2d 356 (8th Cir. 1945); Weather Bureau records of rainfall; <em>United States v. Meyer</em>, 113 F.2d 387 (7th Cir. 1940), cert. denied 311 U.S. 706, 61 S.Ct. 174, 85 L.Ed. 459, map prepared by government engineer from information furnished by men working under his supervision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The more controversial area of public records is that of the so-called &ldquo;evaluative&rdquo; report. The disagreement among the decisions has been due in part, no doubt, to the variety of situations encountered, as well as to differences in principle. Sustaining admissibility are such cases as <em>United States v. Dumas</em>, 149 U.S. 278, 13 S.Ct. 872, 37 L.Ed. 734 (1893), statement of account certified by Postmaster General in action against postmaster; <em>McCarty v. United States</em>, 185 F.2d 520 (5th Cir. 1950), reh. denied 187 F.2d 234, Certificate of Settlement of General Accounting Office showing indebtedness and letter from Army official stating Government had performed, in action on contract to purchase and remove waste food from Army camp; <em>Moran v. Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co</em>., 183 F.2d 467 (3d Cir. 1950), report of Bureau of Mines as to cause of gas tank explosion; Petition of W&mdash;, 164 F.Supp. 659 (E.D.Pa.1958), report by Immigration and Naturalization Service investigator that petitioner was known in community as wife of man to whom she was not married. To the opposite effect and denying admissibility are <em>Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co</em>., 141 F.2d 568 (10th Cir. 1944), State Fire Marshal's report of cause of gas explosion; <em>Lomax Transp. Co. v. United States</em>, 183 F.2d 331 (9th Cir. 1950), Certificate of Settlement from General Accounting Office in action for naval supplies lost in warehouse fire; <em>Yung Jin Teung v. Dulles</em>, 229 F.2d 244 (2d Cir. 1956), &ldquo;Status Reports&rdquo; offered to justify delay in processing passport applications. Police reports have generally been excluded except to the extent to which they incorporate firsthand observations of the officer. Annot., 69 A.L.R.2d 1148. Various kinds of evaluative reports are admissible under federal statutes: 7 U.S.C. &sect;78, findings of Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence of true grade of grain; 7 U.S.C. &sect;210(f), findings of Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence in action for damages against stockyard owner; 7 U.S.C. &sect;292, order by Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence in judicial enforcement proceedings against producers association monopoly; 7 U.S.C. &sect;1622(h), Department of Agriculture inspection certificates of products shipped in interstate commerce prima facie evidence; 8 U.S.C. &sect;1440(c), separation of alien from military service on conditions other than honorable provable by certificate from department in proceedings to revoke citizenship; 18 U.S.C. &sect;4245, certificate of Director of Prisons that convicted person has been examined and found probably incompetent at time of trial prima facie evidence in court hearing on competency; 42 U.S.C. &sect;269(b), bill of health by appropriate official prima facie evidence of vessel's sanitary history and condition and compliance with regulations; 46 U.S.C. &sect;679, certificate of consul presumptive evidence of refusal of master to transport destitute seamen to United States. While these statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule are left undisturbed, Rule 802, the willingness of Congress to recognize a substantial measure of admissibility for evaluative reports is a helpful guide.</p>
<p class="note-body">Factors which may be of assistance in passing upon the admissibility of evaluative reports include; (1) the timeliness of the investigation, McCormack, Can the Courts Make Wider Use of Reports of Official Investigations? 42 Iowa L.Rev. 363 (1957); (2) the special skill or experience of the official, <em>id</em>., (3) whether a hearing was held and the level at which conducted, <em>Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co</em>., 141 F.2d 568 (10th Cir. 1944); (4) possible motivation problems suggested by <em>Palmer v. Hoffman</em>, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). Others no doubt could be added.</p>
<p class="note-body">The formulation of an approach which would give appropriate weight to all possible factors in every situation is an obvious impossibility. Hence the rule, as in Exception [paragraph] (6), assumes admissibility in the first instance but with ample provision for escape if sufficient negative factors are present. In one respect, however, the rule with respect to evaluate reports under item (c) is very specific; they are admissible only in civil cases and against the government in criminal cases in view of the almost certain collision with confrontation rights which would result from their use against the accused in a criminal case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (9). Records of vital statistics are commonly the subject of particular statutes making them admissible in evidence. Uniform Vital Statistics Act, 9C U.L.A. 350 (1957). The rule is in principle narrower than Uniform Rule 63(16) which includes reports required of persons performing functions authorized by statute, yet in practical effect the two are substantially the same. Comment Uniform Rule 63(16). The exception as drafted is in the pattern of California Evidence Code &sect;1281.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (10). The principle of proving nonoccurrence of an event by evidence of the absence of a record which would regularly be made of its occurrence, developed in Exception [paragraph] (7) with respect to regularly conducted activities, is here extended to public records of the kind mentioned in Exceptions [paragraphs] (8) and (9). 5 Wigmore &sect;1633(6), p. 519. Some harmless duplication no doubt exists with Exception [paragraph] (7). For instances of federal statutes recognizing this method of proof, see 8 U.S.C. &sect;1284(b), proof of absence of alien crewman's name from outgoing manifest prima facie evidence of failure to detain or deport, and 42 U.S.C. &sect;405(c)(3), (4)(B), (4)(C), absence of HEW [Department of Health, Education, and Welfare] record prima facie evidence of no wages or self-employment income.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule includes situations in which absence of a record may itself be the ultimate focal point of inquiry, e.g. <em>People v. Love</em>, 310 Ill. 558, 142 N.E. 204 (1923), certificate of Secretary of State admitted to show failure to <!-- PDFPage:417 -->file documents required by Securities Law, as well as cases where the absence of a record is offered as proof of the nonoccurrence of an event ordinarily recorded.</p>
<p class="note-body">The refusal of the common law to allow proof by certificate of the lack of a record or entry has no apparent justification, 5 Wigmore &sect;1678(7), p. 752. The rule takes the opposite position, as do Uniform Rule 63(17); California Evidence Code &sect;1284; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(<em>c</em>); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(17). Congress has recognized certification as evidence of the lack of a record. 8 U.S.C. &sect;1360(d), certificate of Attorney General or other designated officer that no record of Immigration and Naturalization Service of specified nature or entry therein is found, admissible in alien cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (11). Records of activities of religious organizations are currently recognized as admissible at least to the extent of the business records exception to the hearsay rule, 5 Wigmore &sect;1523, p. 371, and Exception [paragraph] (6) would be applicable. However, both the business record doctrine and Exception [paragraph] (6) require that the person furnishing the information be one in the business or activity. The result is such decisions as <em>Daily v. Grand Lodge</em>, 311 Ill. 184, 142 N.E. 478 (1924), holding a church record admissible to prove fact, date, and place of baptism, but not age of child except that he had at least been born at the time. In view of the unlikelihood that false information would be furnished on occasions of this kind, the rule contains no requirement that the informant be in the course of the activity. See California Evidence Code &sect;1315 and Comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (12). The principle of proof by certification is recognized as to public officials in Exceptions [paragraphs] (8) and (10), and with respect to authentication in Rule 902. The present exception is a duplication to the extent that it deals with a certificate by a public official, as in the case of a judge who performs a marriage ceremony. The area covered by the rule is, however, substantially larger and extends the certification procedure to clergymen and the like who perform marriages and other ceremonies or administer sacraments. Thus certificates of such matters as baptism or confirmation, as well as marriage, are included. In principle they are as acceptable evidence as certificates of public officers. See 5 Wigmore &sect;1645, as to marriage certificates. When the person executing the certificate is not a public official, the self-authenticating character of documents purporting to emanate from public officials, see Rule 902, is lacking and proof is required that the person was authorized and did make the certificate. The time element, however, may safely be taken as supplied by the certificate, once authority and authenticity are established, particularly in view of the presumption that a document was executed on the date it bears.</p>
<p class="note-body">For similar rules, some limited to certificates of marriage, with variations in foundation requirements, see Uniform Rule 63(18); California Evidence Code &sect;1316; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(p); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(18).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (13). Records of family history kept in family Bibles have by long tradition been received in evidence. 5 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1495, 1496, citing numerous statutes and decisions. See also Regulations, Social Security Administration, 20 C.F.R. &sect;404.703(c), recognizing family Bible entries as proof of age in the absence of public or church records. Opinions in the area also include inscriptions on tombstones, publicly displayed pedigrees, and engravings on rings. Wigmore, <em>supra</em>. The rule is substantially identical in coverage with California Evidence Code &sect;1312.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (14). The recording of title documents is a purely statutory development. Under any theory of the admissibility of public records, the records would be receivable as evidence of the contents of the recorded document, else the recording process would be reduced to a nullity. When, however, the record is offered for the further purpose of proving execution and delivery, a problem of lack of first-hand knowledge by the recorder, not present as to contents, is presented. This problem is solved, seemingly in all jurisdictions, by qualifying for recording only those documents shown by a specified procedure, either acknowledgement or a form of probate, to have been executed and delivered. 5 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1647&ndash;1651. Thus what may appear in the rule, at first glance, as endowing the record with an effect independently of local law and inviting difficulties of an <em>Erie</em> nature under <em>Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap</em>, 308 U.S. 208, 60 S.Ct. 201, 84 L.Ed. 196 (1939), is not present, since the local law in fact governs under the example.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (15). Dispositive documents often contain recitals of fact. Thus a deed purporting to have been executed by an attorney in fact may recite the existence of the power of attorney, or a deed may recite that the grantors are all the heirs of the last record owner. Under the rule, these recitals are exempted from the hearsay rule. The circumstances under which dispositive documents are executed and the requirement that the recital be germane to the purpose of the document are believed to be adequate guarantees of trustworthiness, particularly in view of the nonapplicability of the rule if dealings with the property have been inconsistent with the document. The age of the document is of no significance, though in practical application the document will most often be an ancient one. See Uniform Rule 63(29), Comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions are contained in Uniform Rule 63(29); California Evidence Code &sect;1330; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(aa); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(29).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (16). Authenticating a document as ancient, essentially in the pattern of the common law, as provided in Rule 901(b)(8), leaves open as a separate question the admissibility of assertive statements contained therein as against a hearsay objection. 7 Wigmore &sect;2145a. Wigmore further states that the ancient document technique of authentication is universally conceded to apply to all sorts of documents, including letters, records, contracts, maps, and certificates, in addition to title documents, citing numerous decisions. <em>Id</em>. &sect;2145. Since most of these items are significant evidentially only insofar as they are assertive, their admission in evidence must be as a hearsay exception. But see 5 <em>id</em>. &sect;1573, p. 429, referring to recitals in ancient deeds as a &ldquo;limited&rdquo; hearsay exception. The former position is believed to be the correct one in reason and authority. As pointed out in McCormick &sect;298, danger of mistake is minimized by authentication requirements, and age affords assurance that the writing antedates the present controversy. See <em>Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assurance Co</em>., 286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1961), upholding admissibility of 58-year-old newspaper story. Cf. Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 364 (1962), but see <em>id</em>. 254.</p>
<p class="note-body">For a similar provision, but with the added requirement that &ldquo;the statement has since generally been acted upon as true by persons having an interest in the matter,&rdquo; see California Evidence Code &sect;1331.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (17). Ample authority at common law supported the admission in evidence of items falling in this category. While Wigmore's text is narrowly oriented to lists, etc., prepared for the use of a trade or profession, 6 Wigmore &sect;1702, authorities are cited which include other kinds of publications, for example, newspaper market reports, telephone directories, and city directories. <em>Id</em>. &sect;&sect;1702&ndash;1706. The basis of trustworthiness is general reliance by the public or by a particular segment of it, and the motivation of the compiler to foster reliance by being accurate.</p>
<p class="note-body">For similar provisions, see Uniform Rule 63(30); California Evidence Code &sect;1340; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(bb); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(30). Uniform Commercial Code &sect;2&ndash;724 provides for admissibility in evidence of &ldquo;reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of such [established commodity] market.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (18). The writers have generally favored the admissibility of learned treatises, McCormick &sect;296, <!-- PDFPage:418 -->p. 621; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 366 (1962); 6 Wigmore &sect;1692, with the support of occasional decisions and rules, <em>City of Dothan v. Hardy</em>, 237 Ala. 603, 188 So. 264 (1939); <em>Lewandowski v. Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co</em>., 33 Wis.2d 69, 146 N.W.2d 505 (1966), 66 Mich.L.Rev. 183 (1967); Uniform Rule 63(31); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(ce), but the great weight of authority has been that learned treatises are not admissible as substantive evidence though usable in the cross-examination of experts. The foundation of the minority view is that the hearsay objection must be regarded as unimpressive when directed against treatises since a high standard of accuracy is engendered by various factors: the treatise is written primarily and impartially for professionals, subject to scrutiny and exposure for inaccuracy, with the reputation of the writer at stake. 6 Wigmore &sect;1692. Sound as this position may be with respect to trustworthiness, there is, nevertheless, an additional difficulty in the likelihood that the treatise will be misunderstood and misapplied without expert assistance and supervision. This difficulty is recognized in the cases demonstrating unwillingness to sustain findings relative to disability on the basis of judicially noticed medical texts. <em>Ross v. Gardner</em>, 365 F.2d 554 (6th Cir. 1966); <em>Sayers v. Gardner</em>, 380 F.2d 940 (6th Cir. 1967); <em>Colwell v. Gardner</em>, 386 F.2d 56 (6th Cir. 1967); <em>Glendenning v. Ribicoff</em>, 213 F.Supp. 301 (W.D.Mo. 1962); <em>Cook v. Celebrezze</em>, 217 F.Supp. 366 (W.D.Mo. 1963); <em>Sosna v. Celebrezze</em>, 234 F.Supp. 289 (E.D.Pa. 1964); and see <em>McDaniel v. Celebrezze</em>, 331 F.2d 426 (4th Cir. 1964). The rule avoids the danger of misunderstanding and misapplication by limiting the use of treatises as substantive evidence to situations in which an expert is on the stand and available to explain and assist in the application of the treatise if declared. The limitation upon receiving the publication itself physically in evidence, contained in the last sentence, is designed to further this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">The relevance of the use of treatises on cross-examination is evident. This use of treatises has been the subject of varied views. The most restrictive position is that the witness must have stated expressly on direct his reliance upon the treatise. A slightly more liberal approach still insists upon reliance but allows it to be developed on cross-examination. Further relaxation dispenses with reliance but requires recognition as an authority by the witness, developable on cross-examination. The greatest liberality is found in decisions allowing use of the treatise on cross-examination when its status as an authority is established by any means. Annot., 60 A.L.R.2d 77. The exception is hinged upon this last position, which is that of the Supreme Court, <em>Reilly v. Pinkus</em>, 338 U.S. 269, 70 S.Ct. 110, 94 L.Ed. 63 (1949), and of recent well considered state court decisions, <em>City of St. Petersburg v. Ferguson</em>, 193 So.2d 648 (Fla.App. 1967), cert. denied Fla., 201 So.2d 556; <em>Darling v. Charleston Memorial Community Hospital</em>, 33 Ill.2d 326, 211 N.E.2d 253 (1965); <em>Dabroe v. Rhodes Co</em>., 64 Wash.2d 431, 392 P.2d 317 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Reilly v. Pinkus, supra</em>, the Court pointed out that testing of professional knowledge was incomplete without exploration of the witness&rsquo; knowledge of and attitude toward established treatises in the field. The process works equally well in reverse and furnishes the basis of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not require that the witness rely upon or recognize the treatise as authoritative, thus avoiding the possibility that the expert may at the outset block cross-examination by refusing to concede reliance or authoritativeness. <em>Dabroe v. Rhodes Co., supra</em>. Moreover, the rule avoids the unreality of admitting evidence for the purpose of impeachment only, with an instruction to the jury not to consider it otherwise. The parallel to the treatment of prior inconsistent statements will be apparent. See Rules 6130(b) and 801(d)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exceptions (19), (20), and (21). Trustworthiness in reputation evidence is found &ldquo;when the topic is such that the facts are likely to have been inquired about and that persons having personal knowledge have disclosed facts which have thus been discussed in the community; and thus the community's conclusion, if any has been formed, is likely to be a trustworthy one.&rdquo; 5 Wigmore &sect;1580, p. 444, and see also &sect;1583. On this common foundation, reputation as to land boundaries, customs, general history, character, and marriage have come to be regarded as admissible. The breadth of the underlying principle suggests the formulation of an equally broad exception, but tradition has in fact been much narrower and more particularized, and this is the pattern of these exceptions in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception [paragraph] (19) is concerned with matters of personal and family history. Marriage is universally conceded to be a proper subject of proof by evidence of reputation in the community. 5 Wigmore &sect;1602. As to such items as legitimacy, relationship, adoption, birth, and death, the decisions are divided. <em>Id</em>. &sect;1605. All seem to be susceptible to being the subject of well founded repute. The &ldquo;world&rdquo; in which the reputation may exist may be family, associates, or community. This world has proved capable of expanding with changing times from the single uncomplicated neighborhood, in which all activities take place, to the multiple and unrelated worlds of work, religious affiliation, and social activity, in each of which a reputation may be generated. <em>People v. Reeves</em>, 360 Ill. 55, 195 N.E. 443 (1935); <em>State v. Axilrod</em>, 248 Minn. 204, 79 N.W.2d 677 (1956); Mass.Stat. 1947, c. 410, M.G.L.A. c. 233 &sect;21A; 5 Wigmore &sect;1616. The family has often served as the point of beginning for allowing community reputation. 5 Wigmore &sect;1488. For comparable provisions see Uniform Rule 63(26), (27)(c); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1313, 1314; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(x), (y)(3); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(26), (27)(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first portion of Exception [paragraph] (20) is based upon the general admissibility of evidence of reputation as to land boundaries and land customs, expanded in this country to include private as well as public boundaries. McCormick &sect;299, p. 625. The reputation is required to antedate the controversy, though not to be ancient. The second portion is likewise supported by authority, <em>id</em>., and is designed to facilitate proof of events when judicial notice is not available The historical character of the subject matter dispenses with any need that the reputation antedate the controversy with respect to which it is offered. For similar provisions see Uniform Rule 63(27)(a), (b); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1320&ndash;1322; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(y), (1), (2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(27)(a), (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception [paragraph] (21) recognizes the traditional acceptance of reputation evidence as a means of proving human character. McCormick &sect;&sect;44, 158. The exception deals only with the hearsay aspect of this kind of evidence. Limitations upon admissibility based on other grounds will be found in Rules 404, relevancy of character evidence generally, and 608, character of witness. The exception is in effect a reiteration, in the context of hearsay, of Rule 405(a). Similar provisions are contained in Uniform Rule 63(28); California Evidence Code &sect;1324; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(z); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(28).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (22). When the status of a former judgment is under consideration in subsequent litigation, three possibilities must be noted: (1) the former judgment is conclusive under the doctrine of res judicata, either as a bar or a collateral estoppel; or (2) it is admissible in evidence for what it is worth; or (3) it may be of no effect at all. The first situation does not involve any problem of evidence except in the way that principles of substantive law generally bear upon the relevancy and materiality of evidence. The rule does not deal with the substantive effect of the judgment as a bar or collateral estoppel. When, however, the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to make the judgment either a bar or a collateral estoppel, a choice is presented between the second and third alternatives. The rule adopts the second for judgments of criminal conviction of felony grade. This is the direction of the decisions, Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1299, which manifest an in<!-- PDFPage:419 -->creasing reluctance to reject <em>in toto</em> the validity of the law's factfinding processes outside the confines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. While this may leave a jury with the evidence of conviction but without means to evaluate it, as suggested by Judge Hinton, Note 27 Ill.L.Rev. 195 (1932), it seems safe to assume that the jury will give it substantial effect unless defendant offers a satisfactory explanation, a possibility not foreclosed by the provision. But see <em>North River Ins. Co. v. Militello</em>, 104 Colo. 28, 88 P.2d 567 (1939), in which the jury found for plaintiff on a fire policy despite the introduction of his conviction for arson. For supporting federal decisions see Clark, J., in <em>New York & Cuba Mail S.S. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co</em>., 117 F.2d 404, 411 (2d Cir. 1941); <em>Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Farrara</em>, 277 F.2d 388 (8th Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">Practical considerations require exclusion of convictions of minor offenses, not became the administration of justice in its lower echelons must be inferior, but because motivation to defend at this level is often minimal or nonexistent. <em>Cope v. Goble</em>, 39 Cal.App.2d 448, 103 P.2d 598 (1940); <em>Jones v. Talbot</em>, 87 Idaho 498, 394 P.2d 316 (1964); <em>Warren v. Marsh</em>, 215 Minn. 615, 11 N.W.2d 528 (1943); Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1295&ndash;1297; 16 Brooklyn L.Rev. 286 (1950); 50 Colum.L.Rev. 529 (1950); 35 Cornell L.Q. 872 (1950). Hence the rule includes only convictions of felony grade, measured by federal standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">Judgments of conviction based upon pleas of <em>nolo contendere</em> are not included. This position is consistent with the treatment of <em>nolo</em> pleas in Rule 410 and the authorities cited in the Advisory Committee's Note in support thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">While these rules do not in general purport to resolve constitutional issues, they have in general been drafted with a view to avoiding collision with constitutional principles. Consequently the exception does not include evidence of the conviction of a third person, offered against the accused in a criminal prosecution to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment of conviction. A contrary position would seem clearly to violate the right of confrontation. <em>Kirby v. United States</em>, 174 U.S. 47, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899), error to convict of possessing stolen postage stamps with the only evidence of theft being the record of conviction of the thieves The situation is to be distinguished from cases in which conviction of another person is an element of the crime, e.g. 15 U.S.C. &sect;902(d), interstate shipment of firearms to a known convicted felon, and, as specifically provided, from impeachment.</p>
<p class="note-body">For comparable provisions see Uniform Rule 63(20); California Evidence Code &sect;1300; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(r); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(20).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (23). A hearsay exception in this area was originally justified on the ground that verdicts were evidence of reputation. As trial by jury graduated from the category of neighborhood inquests, this theory lost its validity. It was never valid as to chancery decrees. Nevertheless the rule persisted, though the judges and writers shifted ground and began saying that the judgment or decree was as good evidence as reputation. See <em>City of London v. Clerke</em>, Carth. 181, 90 Eng.Rep. 710 (K.B. 1691); <em>Neill v. Duke of Devonshire</em>, 8 App.Cas. 135 (1882). The shift appears to be correct, since the process of inquiry, sifting, and scrutiny which is relied upon to render reputation reliable is present in perhaps greater measure in the process of litigation. While this might suggest a broader area of application, the affinity to reputation is strong, and paragraph [paragraph] (23) goes no further, not even including character.</p>
<p class="note-body">The leading case in the <em>United States, Patterson v. Gaines</em>, 47 U.S. (6 How.) 550, 599, 12 L.Ed. 553 (1847), follows in the pattern of the English decisions, mentioning as illustrative matters thus provable: manorial rights, public rights of way, immemorial custom, disputed boundary, and pedigree. More recent recognition of the principle is found in <em>Grant Bros. Construction Co. v. United States</em>, 232 U.S. 647, 34 S.Ct. 452, 58 L.Ed. 776 (1914), in action for penalties under Alien Contract Labor Law, decision of board of inquiry of Immigration Service admissible to prove alienage of laborers, as a matter of pedigree; <em>United States v. Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp</em>., 67 F.2d 37 (10th Cir. 1933), records of commission enrolling Indians admissible on pedigree; <em>Jung Yen Loy v.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(3) was approved in the form submitted by the Court to Congress. However, the Committee intends that the Rule be construed to limit the doctrine of <em>Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon</em>, 145 U.S. 285, 295&ndash;300 (1892), so as to render statements of intent by a declarant admissible only to prove his future conduct, not the future conduct of another person.</p>
<p class="note-body">After giving particular attention to the question of physical examination made solely to enable a physician to testify, the Committee approved Rule 803(4) as submitted to Congress, with the understanding that it is not intended in any way to adversely affect present privilege rules or those subsequently adopted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(5) as submitted by the Court permitted the reading into evidence of a memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable him to testify accurately and fully, &ldquo;shown to have been made when the matter was fresh in his memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly.&rdquo; The Committee amended this Rule to add the words &ldquo;or adopted by the witness&rdquo; after the phrase &ldquo;shown to have been made&rdquo;, a treatment consistent with the definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo; in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500. Moreover, it is the Committee's understanding that a memorandum or report, although barred under this Rule, would nonetheless be admissible if it came within another hearsay exception. This last stated principle is deemed applicable to all the hearsay rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(6) as submitted by the Court permitted a record made &ldquo;in the course of a regularly conducted activity&rdquo; to be admissible in certain circumstances. The Committee believed there were insufficient guarantees of reliability in records made in the course of activities falling outside the scope of &ldquo;business&rdquo; activities as that term is broadly defined in 28 U.S.C. 1732. Moreover, the Committee concluded that the additional requirement of Section 1732 that it must have been the regular practice of a business to make the record is a necessary further assurance of its trustworthiness. The Committee accordingly amended the Rule to incorporate these limitations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(7) as submitted by the Court concerned the <em>absence</em> of entry in the records of a &ldquo;regularly conducted activity.&rdquo; The Committee amended this Rule to conform with its action with respect to Rule 803(6).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved Rule 803(8) without substantive change from the form in which it was submitted by the Court. The Committee intends that the phrase &ldquo;factual findings&rdquo; be strictly construed and that evaluations or opinions contained in public reports shall not be admissible under this Rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved this Rule in the form submitted by the Court, intending that the phrase &ldquo;Statements of fact concerning personal or family history&rdquo; be read to include the specific types of such statements enumerated in Rule 803(11).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">The House approved this rule as it was submitted by the Supreme Court &ldquo;with the understanding that it is not intended in any way to adversely affect present privilege rules.&rdquo; We also approve this rule, and we would point out with respect to the question of its relation to privileges, it must be read in conjunction with rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that whenever the physical or mental condition of a party (plaintiff or defendant) is in con<!-- PDFPage:420 -->troversy, the court may require him to submit to an examination by a physician. It is these examinations which will normally be admitted under this exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(5) as submitted by the Court permitted the reading into evidence of a memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable him to testify accurately and fully, &ldquo;shown to have been made when the matter was fresh in his memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly.&rdquo; The House amended the rule to add the words &ldquo;or adopted by the witness&rdquo; after the phrase &ldquo;shown to have been made,&rdquo; language parallel to the Jencks Act [18 U.S.C. &sect;3500].</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee accepts the House amendment with the understanding and belief that it was not intended to narrow the scope of applicability of the rule. In fact, we understand it to clarify the rule's applicability to a memorandum adopted by the witness as well as one made by him. While the rule as submitted by the Court was silent on the question of who made the memorandum, we view the House amendment as a helpful clarification, noting, however, that the Advisory Committee's note to this rule suggests that the important thing is the accuracy of the memorandum rather than who made it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee does not view the House amendment as precluding admissibility in situations in which multiple participants were involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">When the verifying witness has not prepared the report, but merely examined it and found it accurate, he has adopted the report, and it is therefore admissible. The rule should also be interpreted to cover other situations involving multiple participants, e.g., employer dictating to secretary, secretary making memorandum at direction of employer, or information being passed along a chain of persons, as in <em>Curtis v. Bradley</em> [65 Conn. 99, 31 Atl. 591 (1894); see, also <em>Rathbun v. Brancatella</em>, 93 N.J.L. 222, 107 Atl. 279 (1919); see, also McCormick on Evidence, &sect;303 (2d ed. 1972)].</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee also accepts the understanding of the House that a memorandum or report, although barred under rule, would nonetheless be admissible if it came within another hearsay exception. We consider this principle to be applicable to all the hearsay rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(6) as submitted by the Supreme Court permitted a record made in the course of a regularly conducted activity to be admissible in certain circumstances. This rule constituted a broadening of the traditional business records hearsay exception which has been long advocated by scholars and judges active in the law of evidence</p>
<p class="note-body">The House felt there were insufficient guarantees of reliability of records not within a broadly defined business records exception. We disagree. Even under the House definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; including profession, occupation, and &ldquo;calling of every kind,&rdquo; the records of many regularly conducted activities will, or may be, excluded from evidence. Under the principle of ejusdem generis, the intent of &ldquo;calling of every kind&rdquo; would seem to be related to work-related endeavors&mdash;e.g., butcher, baker, artist, etc.</p>
<p class="note-body">Thus, it appears that the records of many institutions or groups might not be admissible under the House amendments. For example, schools, churches, and hospitals will not normally be considered businesses within the definition. Yet, these are groups which keep financial and other records on a regular basis in a manner similar to business enterprises. We believe these records are of equivalent trustworthiness and should be admitted into evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Three states, which have recently codified their evidence rules, have adopted the Supreme Court version of rule 803(6), providing for admission of memoranda of a &ldquo;regularly conducted activity.&rdquo; None adopted the words &ldquo;business activity&rdquo; used in the House amendment. [See Nev. Rev. Stats. &sect;15.135; N. Mex. Stats. (1973 Supp.) &sect;20&ndash;4&ndash;803(6); West's Wis. Stats. Anno. (1973 Supp.) &sect;908.03(6).]</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, the committee deleted the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; as it appears before the word &ldquo;activity&rdquo;. The last sentence then is unnecessary and was also deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the understanding of the committee that the use of the phrase &ldquo;person with knowledge&rdquo; is not intended to imply that the party seeking to introduce the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation must be able to produce, or even identify, the specific individual upon whose first-hand knowledge the memorandum, report, record or data compilation was based. A sufficient foundation for the introduction of such evidence will be laid if the party seeking to introduce the evidence is able to show that it was the regular practice of the activity to base such memorandums, reports, records, or data compilations upon a transmission from a person with knowledge, e.g., in the case of the content of a shipment of goods, upon a report from the company's receiving agent or in the case of a computer printout, upon a report from the company's computer programer or one who has knowledge of the particular record system. In short, the scope of the phrase &ldquo;person with knowledge&rdquo; is meant to be coterminous with the custodian of the evidence or other qualified witness. The committee believes this represents the desired rule in light of the complex nature of modern business organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House approved rule 803(8), as submitted by the Supreme Court, with one substantive change. It excluded from the hearsay exception reports containing matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel in criminal cases. Ostensibly, the reason for this exclusion is that observations by police officers at the scene of the crime or the apprehension of the defendant are not as reliable as observations by public officials in other cases because of the adversarial nature of the confrontation between the police and the defendant in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee accepts the House's decision to exclude such recorded observations where the police officer is available to testify in court about his observation. However, where he is unavailable as unavailability is defined in rule 804(a)(4) and (a)(5), the report should be admitted as the best available evidence. Accordingly, the committee has amended rule 803(8) to refer to the provision of [proposed] rule 804(b)(5) [deleted], which allows the admission of such reports, records or other statements where the police officer or other law enforcement officer is unavailable because of death, then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity, or not being successfully subject to legal process.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House Judiciary Committee report contained a statement of intent that &ldquo;the phrase &lsquo;factual findings&rsquo; in subdivision (c) be strictly construed and that evaluations or opinions contained in public reports shall not be admissible under this rule.&rdquo; The committee takes strong exception to this limiting understanding of the application of the rule. We do not think it reflects an understanding of the intended operation of the rule as explained in the Advisory Committee notes to this subsection. The Advisory Committee notes on subsection (c) of this subdivision point out that various kinds of evaluative reports are now admissible under Federal statutes. 7 U.S.C. &sect;78, findings of Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence of true grade of grain; 42 U.S.C. &sect;269(b), bill of health by appropriate official prima facie evidence of vessel's sanitary history and condition and compliance with regulations. These statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule are preserved. Rule 802. The willingness of Congress to recognize these and other such evaluative reports provides a helpful guide in determining the kind of reports which are intended to be admissible under this rule. We think the restrictive interpretation of the House overlooks the fact that while the Advisory Committee assumes admissibility in the first instance of evaluative reports, they are not admissible if, as the rule states, &ldquo;the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee explains the factors to be considered:</p>
<p class="5802I92">* * * * *</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Factors which may be assistance in passing upon the admissibility of evaluative reports include: (1) the <!-- PDFPage:421 -->timeliness of the investigation, McCormick, Can the Courts Make Wider Use of Reports of Official Investigations? 42 Iowa L.Rev. 363 (1957); (2) the special skill or experience of the official, id.; (3) whether a hearing was held and the level at which conducted, <em>Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co</em>., 141 F.2d 568 (19th Cir. 1944); (4) possible motivation problems suggested by <em>Palmer v. Hoffman</em>, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). Others no doubt could be added.</p>
<p class="5802I92">* * * * *</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee concludes that the language of the rule together with the explanation provided by the Advisory Committee furnish sufficient guidance on the admissibility of evaluative reports.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed Rules of Evidence submitted to Congress contained identical provisions in rules 803 and 804 (which set forth the various hearsay exceptions), admitting any hearsay statement not specifically covered by any of the stated exceptions, if the hearsay statement was found to have &ldquo;comparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.&rdquo; The House deleted these provisions (proposed rules 803(24) and 804(b)(6)[(5)]) as injecting &ldquo;too much uncertainty&rdquo; into the law of evidence and impairing the ability of practitioners to prepare for trial. The House felt that rule 102, which directs the courts to construe the Rules of Evidence so as to promote growth and development, would permit sufficient flexibility to admit hearsay evidence in appropriate cases under various factual situations that might arise.</p>
<p class="note-body">We disagree with the total rejection of a residual hearsay exception. While we view rule 102 as being intended to provide for a broader construction and interpretation of these rules, we feel that, without a separate residual provision, the specifically enumerated exceptions could become tortured beyond any reasonable circumstances which they were intended to include (even if broadly construed). Moreover, these exceptions, while they reflect the most typical and well recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, may not encompass every situation in which the reliability and appropriateness of a particular piece of hearsay evidence make clear that it should be heard and considered by the trier of fact.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee believes that there are certain exceptional circumstances where evidence which is found by a court to have guarantees of trust worthiness equivalent to or exceeding the guarantees reflected by the presently listed exceptions, and to have a high degree of prolativeness and necessity could properly be admissible.</p>
<p class="note-body">The case of <em>Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assoc. Co., Ltd</em>., 286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1961) illustrates the point. The issue in that case was whether the tower of the county courthouse collapsed because it was struck by lightning (covered by insurance) or because of structural weakness and deterioration of the structure (not covered). Investigation of the structure revealed the presence of charcoal and charred timbers. In order to show that lightning may not have been the cause of the charring, the insurer offered a copy of a local newspaper published over 50 years earlier containing an unsigned article describing a fire in the courthouse while it was under construction. The Court found that the newspaper did not qualify for admission as a business record or an ancient document and did not fit within any other recognized hearsay exception. The court concluded, however, that the article was trustworthy because it was inconceivable that a newspaper reporter in a small town would report a fire in the courthouse if none had occurred. <em>See also United States v. Barbati</em>, 284 F. Supp. 409 (E.D.N.Y. 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because exceptional cases like the <em>Dallas County</em> case may arise in the future, the committee has decided to reinstate a residual exception for rules 803 and 804(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee, however, also agrees with those supporters of the House version who felt that an overly broad residual hearsay exception could emasculate the hearsay rule and the recognized exceptions or vitiate the rationale behind codification of the rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, the committee has adopted a residual exception for rules 803 and 804(b) of much narrower scope and applicability than the Supreme Court version. In order to qualify for admission, a hearsay statement not falling within one of the recognized exceptions would have to satisfy at least four conditions. First, it must have &ldquo;equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.&rdquo; Second, it must be offered as evidence of a material fact. Third, the court must determine that the statement &ldquo;is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts.&rdquo; This requirement is intended to insure that only statements which have high probative value and necessity may qualify for admission under the residual exceptions. Fourth, the court must determine that &ldquo;the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It is intended that the residual hearsay exceptions will be used very rarely, an only in exceptional circumstances. The committee does not intend to establish a broad license for trial judges to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions contained in rules 803 and 804(b). The residual exceptions are not meant to authorize major judicial revisions of the hearsay rule, including its present exceptions. Such major revisions are best accomplished by legislative action. It is intended that in any case in which evidence is sought to be admitted under these subsections, the trial judge will exercise no less care, reflection and caution than the courts did under the common law in establishing the now-recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to establish a well-defined jurisprudence, the special facts and circumstances which, in the court's judgment, indicates that the statement has a sufficiently high degree of trustworthiness and necessity to justify its admission should be stated on the record. It is expected that the court will give the opposing party a full and adequate opportunity to contest the admission of any statement sought to be introduced under these subsections.</p>

<p class="note-body">Rule 803 defines when hearsay statements are admissible in evidence even though the declarant is available as a witness. The Senate amendments make three changes in this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill provides in subsection (6) that records of a regularly conducted &ldquo;business&rdquo; activity qualify for admission into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. &ldquo;Business&rdquo; is defined as including &ldquo;business, profession, occupation and calling of every kind.&rdquo; The Senate amendment drops the requirement that the records be those of a &ldquo;business&rdquo; activity and eliminates the definition of &ldquo;business.&rdquo; The Senate amendment provides that records are admissible if they are records of a regularly conducted &ldquo;activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the House provision that the records must be those of a regularly conducted &ldquo;business&rdquo; activity. The Conferees changed the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; contained in the House provision in order to make it clear that the records of institutions and associations like schools, churches and hospitals are admissible under this provision. The records of public schools and hospitals are also covered by Rule 803(8), which deals with public records and reports.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment adds language, not contained in the House bill, that refers to another rule that was added by the Senate in another amendment ([proposed] Rule 804(b)(5)&mdash;Criminal law enforcement records and reports [deleted]).</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of its action on [proposed] Rule 804(b)(5) (Criminal law enforcement records and reports) [deleted], the Conference does not adopt the Senate amendment and restores the bill to the House version.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:422 --><p class="note-body">The Senate amendment adds a new subsection, (24), which makes admissible a hearsay statement not specifically covered by any of the previous twenty-three subsections, if the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill eliminated a similar, but broader, provision because of the conviction that such a provision injected too much uncertainty into the law of evidence regarding hearsay and impaired the ability of a litigant to prepare adequately for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that provides that a party intending to request the court to use a statement under this provision must notify any adverse party of this intention as well as of the particulars of the statement, including the name and address of the declarant. This notice must be given sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide any adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to contest the use of the statement.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 804. Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay&mdash;When the Declarant Is Unavailable as a Witness</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Being Unavailable.</cap-smallcap> A declarant is considered to be unavailable as a witness if the declarant:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is exempted from testifying about the subject matter of the declarant's statement because the court rules that a privilege applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) refuses to testify about the subject matter despite a court order to do so;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) testifies to not remembering the subject matter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) cannot be present or testify at the trial or hearing because of death or a then-existing infirmity, physical illness, or mental illness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement's proponent has not been able, by process or other reasonable means, to procure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the declarant's attendance, in the case of a hearsay exception under Rule 804(b)(1) or (6); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the declarant's attendance or testimony, in the case of a hearsay exception under Rule 804(b)(2), (3), or (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">But this subdivision (a) does not apply if the statement's proponent procured or wrongfully caused the declarant's unavailability as a witness in order to prevent the declarant from attending or testifying.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>The Exceptions.</cap-smallcap> The following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Former Testimony.</em> Testimony that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was given as a witness at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition, whether given during the current proceeding or a different one; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is now offered against a party who had&mdash;or, in a civil case, whose predecessor in interest had&mdash;an opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct, cross-, or redirect examination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Statement Under the Belief of Imminent Death.</em> In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil case, a statement that the declarant, while believing the declarant's death to be imminent, made about its cause or circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Statement Against Interest.</em> A statement that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it was so contrary to the declarant's proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant's claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness, if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Statement of Personal or Family History.</em> A statement about:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the declarant's own birth, adoption, legitimacy, ancestry, marriage, divorce, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, or similar facts of personal or family history, even though the declarant had no way of acquiring personal knowledge about that fact; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:423 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) another person concerning any of these facts, as well as death, if the declarant was related to the person by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the person's family that the declarant's information is likely to be accurate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) [<em>Other Exceptions.</em>] [Transferred to Rule 807.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Statement Offered Against a Party That Wrongfully Caused the Declarant's Unavailability.</em> A statement offered against a party that wrongfully caused&mdash;or acquiesced in wrongfully causing&mdash;the declarant's unavailability as a witness, and did so intending that result.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">As to firsthand knowledge on the part of hearsay declarants, see the introductory portion of the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 803.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The definition of unavailability implements the division of hearsay exceptions into two categories by Rules 803 and 804(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">At common law the unavailability requirement was evolved in connection with particular hearsay exceptions rather than along general lines. For example, see the separate explication of unavailability in relation to former testimony, declarations against interest, and statements of pedigree, separately developed in McCormick &sect;&sect;234, 257, and 297. However, no reason is apparent for making distinctions as to what satisfies unavailability for the different exceptions. The treatment in the rule is therefore uniform although differences in the range of process for witnesses between civil and criminal cases will lead to a less exacting requirement under item (5). See Rule 45(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 17(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Five instances of unavailability are specified:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Substantial authority supports the position that exercise of a claim of privilege by the declarant satisfies the requirement of unavailability (usually in connection with former testimony). <em>Wyatt v. State</em>, 35 Ala.App. 147, 46 So.2d 837 (1950); <em>State v. Stewart</em>, 85 Kan. 404, 116 P. 489 (1911); Annot., 45 A.L.R.2d 1354; Uniform Rule 62(7)(a); California Evidence Code &sect;240(a)(1); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(g) (1). A ruling by the judge is required, which clearly implies that an actual claim of privilege must be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A witness is rendered unavailable if he simply refuses to testify concerning the subject matter of his statement despite judicial pressures to do so, a position supported by similar considerations of practicality. <em>Johnson v. People</em>, 152 Colo. 586, 384 P.2d 454 (1963); <em>People v. Pickett</em>, 339 Mich. 294, 63 N.W.2d 681, 45 A.L.R.2d 1341 (1954). <em>Contra, Pleau v. State</em>, 255 Wis. 362, 38 N.W.2d 496 (1949).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The position that a claimed lack of memory by the witness of the subject matter of his statement constitutes unavailability likewise finds support in the cases, though not without dissent. McCormick &sect;234, p. 494. If the claim is successful, the practical effect is to put the testimony beyond reach, as in the other instances. In this instance, however, it will be noted that the lack of memory must be established by the testimony of the witness himself, which clearly contemplates his production and subjection to cross-examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Death and infirmity find general recognition as ground. McCormick &sect;&sect;234, 257, 297; Uniform Rule 62(7)(c); California Evidence Code &sect;240(a)(3); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(g)(3); New Jersey Evidence Rule 62(6)(c). See also the provisions on use of depositions in Rule 32(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 15(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Absence from the hearing coupled with inability to compel attendance by process or other reasonable means also satisfies the requirement. McCormick &sect;234; Uniform Rule 62(7)(d) and (e); California Evidence Code &sect;240(a)(4) and (5); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;459(g)(4) and (5); New Jersey Rule 62(6)(b) and (d). See the discussion of procuring attendance of witnesses who are nonresidents or in custody in <em>Barber v. Page</em>, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the conditions otherwise constituting unavailability result from the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the statement, the requirement is not satisfied. The rule contains no requirement that an attempt be made to take the deposition of a declarant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Rule 803 <em>supra</em>, is based upon the assumption that a hearsay statement falling within one of its exceptions possesses qualities which justify the conclusion that whether the declarant is available or unavailable is not a relevant factor in determining admissibility. The instant rule proceeds upon a different theory: hearsay which admittedly is not equal in quality to testimony of the declarant on the stand may nevertheless be admitted if the declarant is unavailable and if his statement meets a specified standard. The rule expresses preferences: testimony given on the stand in person is preferred over hearsay, and hearsay, if of the specified quality, is preferred over complete loss of the evidence of the declarant. The exceptions evolved at common law with respect to declarations of unavailable declarants furnish the basis for the exceptions enumerated in the proposal. The term &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; is defined in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (1)</em>. Former testimony does not rely upon some set of circumstances to substitute for oath and cross-examination, since both oath and opportunity to cross-examine were present in fact. The only missing one of the ideal conditions for the giving of testimony is the presence of trier and opponent (&ldquo;demeanor evidence&rdquo;). This is lacking with all hearsay exceptions. Hence it may be argued that former testimony is the strongest hearsay and should be included under Rule 803, <em>supra</em>. However, opportunity to observe demeanor is what in a large measure confers depth and meaning upon oath and cross-examination. Thus in cases under Rule 803 demeanor lacks the significance which it possesses with respect to testimony. In any event, the tradition, founded in experience, uniformly favors production of the witness if he is available. The exception indicates continuation of the policy. This preference for the presence of the witness is apparent also in rules and statutes on the use of depositions, which deal with substantially the same problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the exception, the testimony may be offered (1) against the party <em>against</em> whom it was previously offered or (2) against the party <em>by</em> whom it was previously offered. In each instance the question resolves itself into whether fairness allows imposing, upon the party against whom now offered, the handling of the witness on the earlier occasion. (1) If the party against whom now offered is the one against whom the testimony was offered previously, no unfairness is apparent in requiring him to accept his own prior conduct of cross-examination or decision not to cross-examine. Only demeanor has been lost, and that is inherent in the situation. (2) If the party against whom now offered is the one <em>by</em> whom the testimony was offered previously, a satisfactory answer becomes somewhat more difficult. One possibility is to proceed somewhat along the line of an adoptive admission, i.e. by offering the testimony proponent in effect adopts it. However, this theory savors of discarded concepts of witnesses&rsquo; belonging to a party, of litigants&rsquo; ability to pick and choose witnesses, and of vouching for one's own witnesses. Cf. McCormick &sect;246, pp. 526&ndash;527; 4 Wigmore &sect;1075. A more direct and ac<!-- PDFPage:424 -->ceptable approach is simply to recognize direct and redirect examination of one's own witness as the equivalent of cross-examining an opponent's witness. Falknor, Former Testimony and the Uniform Rules: A Comment, 38 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 651, n. 1 (1963); McCormick &sect;231, p. 483. See also 5 Wigmore &sect;1389. Allowable techniques for dealing with hostile, doublecrossing, forgetful, and mentally deficient witnesses leave no substance to a claim that one could not adequately develop his own witness at the former hearing. An even less appealing argument is presented when failure to develop fully was the result of a deliberate choice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The common law did not limit the admissibility of former testimony to that given in an earlier trial of the same case, although it did require identity of issues as a means of insuring that the former handling of the witness was the equivalent of what would now be done if the opportunity were presented. Modern decisions reduce the requirement to &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; identity. McCormick &sect;233. Since identity of issues is significant only in that it bears on motive and interest in developing fully the testimony of the witness, expressing the matter in the latter terms is preferable. <em>Id</em>. Testimony given at a preliminary hearing was held in <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970), to satisfy confrontation requirements in this respect.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a further assurance of fairness in thrusting upon a party the prior handling of the witness, the common law also insisted upon identity of parties, deviating only to the extent of allowing substitution of successors in a narrowly construed privity. Mutuality as an aspect of identity is now generally discredited, and the requirement of identity of the offering party disappears except as it might affect motive to develop the testimony. Falknor, <em>supra</em>, at 652; McCormick &sect;232, pp. 487&ndash;488. The question remains whether strict identity, or privity, should continue as a requirement with respect to the party against whom offered. The rule departs to the extent of allowing substitution of one with the right and opportunity to develop the testimony with similar motive and interest. This position is supported by modern decisions. McCormick &sect;232, pp. 489&ndash;490; 5 Wigmore &sect;1388.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of the same tenor will be found in Uniform Rule 63(3)(b); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1290&ndash;1292; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(c)(2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(3). Unlike the rule, the latter three provide either that former testimony is not admissible if the right of confrontation is denied or that it is not admissible if the accused was not a party to the prior hearing. The genesis of these limitations is a caveat in Uniform Rule 63(3) Comment that use of former testimony against an accused may violate his right of confrontation. <em>Mattox v. United States</em>, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895), held that the right was not violated by the Government's use, on a retrial of the same case, of testimony given at the first trial by two witnesses since deceased. The decision leaves open the questions (1) whether direct and redirect are equivalent to cross-examination for purposes of confrontation, (2) whether testimony given in a different proceeding is acceptable, and (3) whether the accused must himself have been a party to the earlier proceeding or whether a similarly situated person will serve the purpose. Professor Falknor concluded that, if a dying declaration untested by cross-examination is constitutionally admissible, former testimony tested by the cross-examination of one similarly situated does not offend against confrontation. Falknor, <em>supra</em>, at 659&ndash;660. The constitutional acceptability of dying declarations has often been conceded. <em>Mattox v. United States</em>, 156 U.S. 237, 243, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895); <em>Kirby v. United States</em>, 174 U.S. 47, 61, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899); <em>Pointer v. Texas</em>, 380 U.S. 400, 407, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (2)</em>. The exception is the familiar dying declaration of the common law, expanded somewhat beyond its traditionally narrow limits. While the original religious justification for the exception may have lost its conviction for some persons over the years, it can scarcely be doubted that powerful psychological pressures are present. See 5 Wigmore &sect;1443 and the classic statement of Chief Baron Eyre in <em>Rex v. Woodcock</em>, 1 Leach 500, 502, 168 Eng.Rep. 352, 353 (K.B. 1789).</p>
<p class="note-body">The common law required that the statement be that of the victim, offered in a prosecution for criminal homicide. Thus declarations by victims in prosecutions for other crimes, e.g. a declaration by a rape victim who dies in childbirth, and all declarations in civil cases were outside the scope of the exception. An occasional statute has removed these restrictions, as in Colo.R.S. &sect;52&ndash;1&ndash;20, or has expanded the area of offenses to include abortions, 5 Wigmore &sect;1432, p. 224, n. 4. Kansas by decision extended the exception to civil cases. <em>Thurston v. Fritz</em>, 91 Kan. 468, 138 P. 625 (1914). While the common law exception no doubt originated as a result of the exceptional need for the evidence in homicide cases, the theory of admissibility applies equally in civil cases and in prosecutions for crimes other than homicide. The same considerations suggest abandonment of the limitation to circumstances attending the event in question, yet when the statement deals with matters other than the supposed death, its influence is believed to be sufficiently attenuated to justify the limitation. Unavailability is not limited to death. See subdivision (a) of this rule. Any problem as to declarations phrased in terms of opinion is laid at rest by Rule 701, and continuation of a requirement of first-hand knowledge is assured by Rule 602.</p>
<p class="note-body">Comparable provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63 (5); California Evidence Code &sect;1242; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(e); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(5).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (3)</em>. The circumstantial guaranty of reliability for declarations against interest is the assumption that persons do not make statements which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied for good reason that they are true. <em>Hileman v. Northwest Engineering Co</em>., 346 F.2d 668 (6th Cir. 1965). If the statement is that of a party, offered by his opponent, it comes in as an admission, Rule 803(d)(2), and there is no occasion to inquire whether it is against interest, this not being a condition precedent to admissibility of admissions by opponents.</p>
<p class="note-body">The common law required that the interest declared against be pecuniary or proprietary but within this limitation demonstrated striking ingenuity in discovering an against-interest aspect. <em>Higham v. Ridgeway</em>, 10 East 109, 103 Eng.Rep. 717 (K.B. 1808); <em>Reg. v. Overseers of Birmingham</em>, 1 B. & S. 763, 121 Eng.Rep. 897 (Q.B. 1861); McCormick, &sect;256, p. 551, nn. 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception discards the common law limitation and expands to the full logical limit. One result is to remove doubt as to the admissibility of declarations tending to establish a tort liability against the declarant or to extinguish one which might be asserted by him, in accordance with the trend of the decisions in this country. McCormick &sect;254, pp. 548&ndash;549. Another is to allow statements tending to expose declarant to hatred, ridicule, or disgrace, the motivation here being considered to be as strong as when financial interests are at stake. McCormick &sect;255, p. 551. And finally, exposure to criminal liability satisfies the against-interest requirement. The refusal of the common law to concede the adequacy of a penal interest was no doubt indefensible in logic, see the dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Donnelly v. United States</em>, 228 U.S. 243, 33 S.Ct. 449, 57 L.Ed. 820 (1913), but one senses in the decisions a distrust of evidence of confessions by third persons offered to exculpate the accused arising from suspicions of fabrication either of the fact of the making of the confession or in its contents, enhanced in either instance by the required unavailability of the declarant. Nevertheless, an increasing amount of decisional law recognizes exposure to punishment for crime as a sufficient stake. <em>People v. Spriggs</em>, 60 Cal.2d 868, 36 Cal.Rptr. 841, 389 P.2d 377 (1964); <em>Sutter v. Easterly</em>, 354 Mo. 282, 189 S.W.2d 284 (1945); <em>Band's Refuse Removal, Inc. v. Fairlawn Borough</em>, 62 N.J.Super. 552, 163 A.2d 465 (1960); <em>Newberry v. Commonwealth</em>, 191 Va. 445, 61 S.E.2d 318 (1950); Annot., 162 <!-- PDFPage:425 -->A.L.R. 446. The requirement of corroboration is included in the rule in order to effect an accommodation between these competing considerations. When the statement is offered by the accused by way of exculpation, the resulting situation is not adapted to control by rulings as to the weight of the evidence and, hence the provision is cast in terms of a requirement preliminary to admissibility. Cf. Rule 406(a). The requirement of corroboration should be construed in such a manner as to effectuate its purpose of circumventing fabrication.</p>
<p class="note-body">Ordinarily the third-party confession is thought of in terms of exculpating the accused, but this is by no means always or necessarily the case: it may include statements implicating him, and under the general theory of declarations against interest they would be admissible as related statements. <em>Douglas v. Alabama</em>, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), and <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, 19 L.Ed.2d 70 (1968), both involved confessions by codefendants which implicated the accused. While the confession was not actually offered in evidence in <em>Douglas</em>, the procedure followed effectively put it before the jury, which the Court ruled to be error. Whether the confession might have been admissible as a declaration against penal interest was not considered or discussed. <em>Bruton</em> assumed the inadmissibility, as against the accused, of the implicating confession of his codefendant, and centered upon the question of the effectiveness of a limiting instruction. These decisions, however, by no means require that all statements implicating another person be excluded from the category of declarations against interest. Whether a statement is in fact against interest must be determined from the circumstances of each case. Thus a statement admitting guilt and implicating another person, made while in custody, may well be motivated by a desire to curry favor with the authorities and hence fail to qualify as against interest. See the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice White in <em>Bruton</em>. On the other hand, the same words spoken under different circumstances, <em>e.g</em>., to an acquaintance, would have no difficulty in qualifying. The rule does not purport to deal with questions of the right of confrontation.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Exception (4)</em>. The general common law requirement that a declaration in this area must have been made <em>ante litem motam</em> has been dropped, as bearing more appropriately on weight than admissibility. See 5 Wigmore &sect;1483. Item (i)[(A)] specifically disclaims any need of firsthand knowledge respecting declarant's own personal history. In some instances it is self-evident (marriage) and in others impossible and traditionally not required (date of birth). Item (ii)[(B)] deals with declarations concerning the history of another person. As at common law, declarant is qualified if related by blood or marriage. 5 Wigmore &sect;1489. In addition, and contrary to the common law, declarant qualifies by virtue of intimate association with the family. <em>Id</em>., &sect;1487.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(a)(3) was approved in the form submitted by the Court. However, the Committee intends no change in existing federal law under which the court may choose to disbelieve the declarant's testimony as to his lack of memory. See <em>United States v. Insana</em>, 423 F.2d 1165, 1169&ndash;1170 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 841 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(a)(5) as submitted to the Congress provided, as one type of situation in which a declarant would be deemed &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;, that he be &ldquo;absent from the hearing and the proponent of his statement has been unable to procure his attendance by process or other reasonable means.&rdquo; The Committee amended the Rule to insert after the word &ldquo;attendance&rdquo; the parenthetical expression &ldquo;(or, in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or (4), his attendance or testimony)&rdquo;. The amendment is designed primarily to require that an attempt be made to depose a witness (as well as to seek his attendance) as a precondition to the witness being deemed unavailable. The Committee, however, recognized the propriety of an exception to this additional requirement when it is the declarant's former testimony that is sought to be admitted under subdivision (b)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(b)(1) as submitted by the Court allowed prior testimony of an unavailable witness to be admissible if the party against whom it is offered or a person &ldquo;with motive and interest similar&rdquo; to his had an opportunity to examine the witness. The Committee considered that it is generally unfair to impose upon the party against whom the hearsay evidence is being offered responsibility for the manner in which the witness was previously handled by another party. The sole exception to this, in the Committee's view, is when a party's predecessor in interest in a civil action or proceeding had an opportunity and similar motive to examine the witness. The Committee amended the Rule to reflect these policy determinations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(b)(3) as submitted by the Court (now Rule 804(b)(2) in the bill) proposed to expand the traditional scope of the dying declaration exception (i.e. a statement of the victim in a homicide case as to the cause or circumstances of his believed imminent death) to allow such statements in all criminal and civil cases. The Committee did not consider dying declarations as among the most reliable forms of hearsay. Consequently, it amended the provision to limit their admissibility in criminal cases to homicide prosecutions, where exceptional need for the evidence is present. This is existing law. At the same time, the Committee approved the expansion to civil actions and proceedings where the stakes do not involve possible imprisonment, although noting that this could lead to forum shopping in some instances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804(b)(4) as submitted by the Court (now Rule 804(b)(3) in the bill) provided as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em"><em>Statement against interest.&mdash;</em>A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest or so far tended to subject him to civil or criminal liability or to render invalid a claim by him against another or to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace, that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true. A statement tending to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee determined to retain the traditional hearsay exception for statements against pecuniary or proprietary interest. However, it deemed the Court's additional references to statements tending to subject a declarant to civil liability or to render invalid a claim by him against another to be redundant as included within the scope of the reference to statements against pecuniary or proprietary interest. See <em>Gichner v. Antonio Triano Tile and Marble Co</em>., 410 F.2d 238 (D.C. Cir. 1968). Those additional references were accordingly deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Court's Rule also proposed to expand the hearsay limitation from its present federal limitation to include statements subjecting the declarant to criminal liability and statements tending to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace. The Committee eliminated the latter category from the subdivision as lacking sufficient guarantees of reliability. See <em>United States v. Dovico</em>, 380 F.2d 325, 327nn.2,4 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 944 (1967). As for statements against penal interest, the Committee shared the view of the <!-- PDFPage:426 -->Court that some such statements do possess adequate assurances of reliability and should be admissible. It believed, however, as did the Court, that statements of this type tending to exculpate the accused are more suspect and so should have their admissibility conditioned upon some further provision insuring trustworthiness. The proposal in the Court Rule to add a requirement of simple corroboration was, however, deemed ineffective to accomplish this purpose since the accused's own testimony might suffice while not necessarily increasing the reliability of the hearsay statement. The Committee settled upon the language &ldquo;unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement&rdquo; as affording a proper standard and degree of discretion. It was contemplated that the result in such cases as <em>Donnelly v. United States</em>, 228 U.S. 243 (1912), where the circumstances plainly indicated reliability, would be changed. The Committee also added to the Rule the final sentence from the 1971 Advisory Committee draft, designed to codify the doctrine of <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). The Committee does not intend to affect the existing exception to the <em>Bruton</em> principle where the codefendant takes the stand and is subject to cross-examination, but believed there was no need to make specific provision for this situation in the Rule, since in that even the declarant would not be &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of rule 804 as submitted by the Supreme Court defined the conditions under which a witness was considered to be unavailable. It was amended in the House.</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the amendment, according to the report of the House Committee on the Judiciary, is &ldquo;primarily to require that an attempt be made to depose a witness (as well as to seek his attendance) as a precondition to the witness being unavailable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the House amendment, before a witness is declared unavailable, a party must try to depose a witness (declarant) with respect to dying declarations, declarations against interest, and declarations of pedigree. None of these situations would seem to warrant this needless, impractical and highly restrictive complication. A good case can be made for eliminating the unavailability requirement entirely for declarations against interest cases. [Uniform rule 63(10); Kan. Stat. Anno. 60&ndash;460(j); 2A N.J. Stats. Anno. 84&ndash;63(10).]</p>
<p class="note-body">In dying declaration cases, the declarant will usually, though not necessarily, be deceased at the time of trial. Pedigree statements which are admittedly and necessarily based largely on word of mouth are not greatly fortified by a deposition requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Depositions are expensive and time-consuming. In any event, deposition procedures are available to those who wish to resort to them. Moreover, the deposition procedures of the Civil Rules and Criminal Rules are only imperfectly adapted to implementing the amendment. No purpose is served unless the deposition, if taken, may be used in evidence. Under Civil Rule (a)(3) and Criminal Rule 15(e), a deposition, though taken, may not be admissible, and under Criminal Rule 15(a) substantial obstacles exist in the way of even taking a deposition.</p>
<p class="note-body">For these reasons, the committee deleted the House amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee understands that the rule as to unavailability, as explained by the Advisory Committee &ldquo;contains no requirement that an attempt be made to take the deposition of a declarant.&rdquo; In reflecting the committee's judgment, the statement is accurate insofar as it goes. Where, however, the proponent of the statement, with knowledge of the existence of the statement, fails to confront the declarant with the statement at the taking of the deposition, then the proponent should not, in fairness, be permitted to treat the declarant as &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; simply because the declarant was not amendable to process compelling his attendance at trial. The committee does not consider it necessary to amend the rule to this effect because such a situation abuses, not conforms to, the rule. Fairness would preclude a person from introducing a hearsay statement on a particular issue if the person taking the deposition was aware of the issue at the time of the deposition but failed to depose the unavailable witness on that issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former testimony.&mdash;Rule 804(b)(1) as submitted by the Court allowed prior testimony of an unavailable witness to be admissible if the party against whom it is offered or a person &ldquo;with motive and interest similar&rdquo; to his had an opportunity to examine the witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House amended the rule to apply only to a party's predecessor in interest. Although the committee recognizes considerable merit to the rule submitted by the Supreme Court, a position which has been advocated by many scholars and judges, we have concluded that the difference between the two versions is not great and we accept the House amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule defines those statements which are considered to be against interest and thus of sufficient trustworthiness to be admissible even though hearsay. With regard to the type of interest declared against, the version submitted by the Supreme Court included inter alia, statements tending to subject a declarant to civil liability or to invalidate a claim by him against another. The House struck these provisions as redundant. In view of the conflicting case law construing pecuniary or proprietary interests narrowly so as to exclude, e.g., tort cases, this deletion could be misconstrued.</p>
<p class="note-body">Three States which have recently codified their rules of evidence have followed the Supreme Court's version of this rule, i.e., that a statement is against interest if it tends to subject a declarant to civil liability. [Nev. Rev. Stats. &sect;51.345; N. Mex. Stats. (1973 supp.) &sect;20&ndash;4&ndash;804(4); West's Wis. Stats. Anno. (1973 supp.) &sect;908.045(4).]</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee believes that the reference to statements tending to subject a person to civil liability constitutes a desirable clarification of the scope of the rule. Therefore, we have reinstated the Supreme Court language on this matter.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Court rule also proposed to expand the hearsay limitation from its present federal limitation to include statements subjecting the declarant to statements tending to make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace. The House eliminated the latter category from the subdivision as lacking sufficient guarantees of reliability. Although there is considerable support for the admissibility of such statements (all three of the State rules referred to supra, would admit such statements), we accept the deletion by the House.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House amended this exception to add a sentence making inadmissible a statement or confession offered against the accused in a criminal case, made by a codefendant or other person implicating both himself and the accused. The sentence was added to codify the constitutional principle announced in <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). <em>Bruton</em> held that the admission of the extrajudicial hearsay statement of one codefendant inculpating a second codefendant violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee decided to delete this provision because the basic approach of the rules is to avoid codifying, or attempting to codify, constitutional evidentiary principles, such as the fifth amendment's right against self-incrimination and, here, the sixth amendment's right of confrontation. Codification of a constitutional principle is unnecessary and, where the principle is under development, often unwise. Furthermore, the House provision does not appear to recognize the exceptions to the <em>Bruton</em> rule, e.g. where the codefendant takes the stand and is subject to cross examination; where the accused confessed, see <em>United States v. Mancusi</em>, 404 F.2d 296 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied 397 U.S. 942 (1907); where the accused was placed at the scene of the crime, see <em>United States v. Zelker</em>, 452 F.2d 1009 (2d Cir. 1971). For these reasons, the committee decided to delete this provision.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:427 --><p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)(5)</em>. See Note to Paragraph (24), Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277, set out as a note under rule 803 of these rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 804 defines what hearsay statements are admissible in evidence if the declarant is unavailable as a witness. The Senate amendments make four changes in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) defines the term &ldquo;unavailability as a witness&rdquo;. The House bill provides in subsection (a)(5) that the party who desires to use the statement must be unable to procure the declarant's attendance by process or other reasonable means. In the case of dying declarations, statements against interest and statements of personal or family history, the House bill requires that the proponent must also be unable to procure the declarant's <em>testimony</em> (such as by deposition or interrogatories) by process or other reasonable means. The Senate amendment eliminates this latter provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the provision contained in the House bill.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment to subsection (b)(3) provides that a statement is against interest and not excluded by the hearsay rule when the declarant is unavailable as a witness, if the statement tends to subject a person to civil or criminal liability or renders invalid a claim by him against another. The House bill did not refer specifically to civil liability and to rendering invalid a claim against another. The Senate amendment also deletes from the House bill the provision that subsection (b)(3) does not apply to a statement or confession, made by a codefendant or another, which implicates the accused and the person who made the statement, when that statement or confession is offered against the accused in a criminal case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment. The Conferees intend to include within the purview of this rule, statements subjecting a person to civil liability and statements rendering claims invalid. The Conferees agree to delete the provision regarding statements by a codefendant, thereby reflecting the general approach in the Rules of Evidence to avoid attempting to codify constitutional evidentiary principles.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment adds a new subsection, (b)(6) [now (b)(5)], which makes admissible a hearsay statement not specifically covered by any of the five previous subsections, if the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill eliminated a similar, but broader, provision because of the conviction that such a provision injected too much uncertainty into the law of evidence regarding hearsay and impaired the ability of a litigant to prepare adequately for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that renumbers this subsection and provides that a party intending to request the court to use a statement under this provision must notify any adverse party of this intention as well as of the particulars of the statement, including the name and address of the declarant. This notice must be given sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide any adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare the contest the use of the statement.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(5).</em> The contents of Rule 803(24) and Rule 804(b)(5) have been combined and transferred to a new Rule 807. This was done to facilitate additions to Rules 803 and 804. No change in meaning is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(6).</em> Rule 804(b)(6) has been added to provide that a party forfeits the right to object on hearsay grounds to the admission of a declarant's prior statement when the party's deliberate wrongdoing or acquiescence therein procured the unavailability of the declarant as a witness. This recognizes the need for a prophylactic rule to deal with abhorrent behavior &ldquo;which strikes at the heart of the system of justice itself.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Mastrangelo</em>, 693 F.2d 269, 273 (2d Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied</em>, 467 U.S. 1204 (1984). The wrongdoing need not consist of a criminal act. The rule applies to all parties, including the government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Every circuit that has resolved the question has recognized the principle of forfeiture by misconduct, although the tests for determining whether there is a forfeiture have varied. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Aguiar</em>, 975 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Potamitis</em>, 739 F.2d 784, 789 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 469 U.S. 918 (1984); <em>Steele v. Taylor</em>, 684 F.2d 1193, 1199 (6th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied</em>, 460 U.S. 1053 (1983); <em>United States v. Balano</em>, 618 F.2d 624, 629 (10th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied</em>, 449 U.S. 840 (1980); <em>United States v. Carlson</em>, 547 F.2d 1346, 1358&ndash;59 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 431 U.S. 914 (1977). The foregoing cases apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>Contra United States v. Thevis</em>, 665 F.2d 616, 631 (5th Cir.) (clear and convincing standard), <cap-smallcap>cert. denied</cap-smallcap>, 459 U.S. 825 (1982). The usual Rule 104(a) preponderance of the evidence standard has been adopted in light of the behavior the new Rule 804(b)(6) seeks to discourage.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 804(b)(5)</em>. The words &ldquo;Transferred to Rule 807&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;Abrogated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 804(b)(6)</em>. The title of the rule was changed to &ldquo;Forfeiture by wrongdoing.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 24 was changed to &ldquo;that&rdquo; to indicate that the rule is potentially applicable against the government. Two sentences were added to the first paragraph of the committee note to clarify that the wrongdoing need not be criminal in nature, and to indicate the rule's potential applicability to the government. The word &ldquo;forfeiture&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;waiver&rdquo; in the note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2010 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3).</em> Rule 804(b)(3) has been amended to provide that the corroborating circumstances requirement applies to all declarations against penal interest offered in criminal cases. A number of courts have applied the corroborating circumstances requirement to declarations against penal interest offered by the prosecution, even though the text of the Rule did not so provide. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez</em>, 584 F.2d 694, 701 (5th Cir. 1978) (&ldquo;by transplanting the language governing exculpatory statements onto the analysis for admitting inculpatory hearsay, a unitary standard is derived which offers the most workable basis for applying Rule 804(b)(3)&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Shukri</em>, 207 F.3d 412 (7th Cir. 2000) (requiring corroborating circumstances for against-penal-interest statements offered by the government). A unitary approach to declarations against penal interest assures both the prosecution and the accused that the Rule will not be abused and that only reliable hearsay statements will be admitted under the exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">All other changes to the structure and wording of the Rule are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any other result in any ruling on evidence admissibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment does not address the use of the corroborating circumstances for declarations against penal interest offered in civil cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In assessing whether corroborating circumstances exist, some courts have focused on the credibility of the witness who relates the hearsay statement in <!-- PDFPage:428 -->court. But the credibility of the witness who relates the statement is not a proper factor for the court to consider in assessing corroborating circumstances. To base admission or exclusion of a hearsay statement on the witness's credibility would usurp the jury's role of determining the credibility of testifying witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments.</em> The rule, as submitted for public comment, was restyled in accordance with the style conventions of the Style Subcommittee of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure. As restyled, the proposed amendment addresses the style suggestions made in public comments.</p>

<p class="note-body">On principle it scarcely seems open to doubt that the hearsay rule should not call for exclusion of a hearsay statement which includes a further hearsay statement when both conform to the requirements of a hearsay exception. Thus a hospital record might contain an entry of the patient's age based on information furnished by his wife. The hospital record would qualify as a regular entry except that the person who furnished the information was not acting in the routine of the business. However, her statement independently qualifies as a statement of pedigree (if she is unavailable) or as a statement made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment, and hence each link in the chain falls under sufficient assurances. Or, further to illustrate, a dying declaration may incorporate a declaration against interest by another declarant. See McCormick &sect;290, p. 611.</p>

<p class="note-body">The declarant of a hearsay statement which is admitted in evidence is in effect a witness. His credibility should in fairness be subject to impeachment and support as though he had in fact testified. See Rules 608 and 609. There are however, some special aspects of the impeaching of a hearsay declarant which require consideration. These special aspects center upon impeachment by inconsistent statement, arise from factual differences which exist between the use of hearsay and an actual witness and also between various kinds of hearsay, and involve the question of applying to declarants the general rule disallowing evidence of an inconsistent statement to impeach a witness unless he is afforded an opportunity to deny or explain. See Rule 613(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The principle difference between using hearsay and an actual witness is that the inconsistent statement will in the case of the witness almost inevitably of necessity in the nature of things be a <em>prior</em> statement, which it is entirely possible and feasible to call to his attention, while in the case of hearsay the inconsistent statement may well be a <em>subsequent</em> one, which practically precludes calling it to the attention of the declarant. The result of insisting upon observation of this impossible requirement in the hearsay situation is to deny the opponent, already barred from cross-examination, any benefit of this important technique of impeachment. The writers favor allowing the subsequent statement. McCormick &sect;37, p. 69; 3 Wigmore &sect;1033. The cases, however, are divided. Cases allowing the impeachment include <em>People v. Collup</em>, 27 Cal.2d 829, 167 P.2d 714 (1946); <em>People v. Rosoto</em>, 58 Cal.2d 304, 23 Cal.Rptr. 779, 373 P.2d 867 (1962); <em>Carver v. United States</em>, 164 U.S. 694, 17 S.Ct. 228, 41 L.Ed. 602 (1897). <em>Contra, Mattox v. United States</em>, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895); <em>People v. Hines</em>, 284 N.Y. 93, 29 N.E.2d 483 (1940). The force of <em>Mattox</em>, where the hearsay was the former testimony of a deceased witness and the denial of use of a subsequent inconsistent statement was upheld, is much diminished by <em>Carver</em>, where the hearsay was a dying declaration and denial of use of a subsequent inconsistent statement resulted in reversal. The difference in the particular brand of hearsay seems unimportant when the inconsistent statement is a <em>subsequent</em> one. True, the opponent is not totally deprived of cross-examination when the hearsay is former testimony or a deposition but he is deprived of cross-examining on the statement or along lines suggested by it. Mr. Justice Shiras, with two justices joining him, dissented vigorously in <em>Mattox.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">When the impeaching statement was made <em>prior</em> to the hearsay statement, differences in the kinds of hearsay appear which arguably may justify differences in treatment. If the hearsay consisted of a simple statement by the witness, e.g. a dying declaration or a declaration against interest, the feasibility of affording him an opportunity to deny or explain encounters the same practical impossibility as where the statement is a subsequent one, just discussed, although here the impossibility arises from the total absence of anything resembling a hearing at which the matter could be put to <!-- PDFPage:429 -->him. The courts by a large majority have ruled in favor of allowing the statement to be used under these circumstances. McCormick &sect;37, p. 69; 3 Wigmore &sect;1033. If, however, the hearsay consists of former testimony or a deposition, the possibility of calling the prior statement to the attention of the witness or deponent is not ruled out, since the opportunity to cross-examine was available. It might thus be concluded that with former testimony or depositions the conventional foundation should be insisted upon. Most of the cases involve depositions, and Wigmore describes them as divided. 3 Wigmore &sect;1031. Deposition procedures at best are cumbersome and expensive, and to require the laying of the foundation may impose an undue burden. Under the federal practice, there is no way of knowing with certainty at the time of taking a deposition whether it is merely for discovery or will ultimately end up in evidence. With respect to both former testimony and depositions the possibility exists that knowledge of the statement might not be acquired until after the time of the cross-examination. Moreover, the expanded admissibility of former testimony and depositions under Rule 804(b)(1) calls for a correspondingly expanded approach to impeachment. The rule dispenses with the requirement in all hearsay situations, which is readily administered and best calculated to lead to fair results.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notice should be taken that Rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as originally submitted by the Advisory Committee, ended with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and, without having first called them to the deponent's attention, may show statements contradictory thereto made at any time by the deponent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">This language did not appear in the rule as promulgated in December, 1937. See 4 Moore's Federal Practice &nbsp;26.01[9], 26.35 (2d ed. 1967). In 1951, Nebraska adopted a provision strongly resembling the one stricken from the federal rule:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Any party may impeach any adverse deponent by self-contradiction without having laid foundation for such impeachment at the time such deposition was taken.&rdquo; R.S.Neb. &sect;25&ndash;1267.07.</p>
<p class="note-body">For similar provisions, see Uniform Rule 65; California Evidence Code &sect;1202; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;462; New Jersey Evidence Rule 65.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision for cross-examination of a declarant upon his hearsay statement is a corollary of general principles of cross-examination. A similar provision is found in California Evidence Code &sect;1203.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 906, as passed by the House and as proposed by the Supreme Court provides that whenever a hearsay statement is admitted, the credibility of the declarant of the statement may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness. Rule 801 defines what is a hearsay statement. While statements by a person authorized by a party-opponent to make a statement concerning the subject, by the party-opponent's agent or by a coconspirator of a party&mdash;see rule 801(d)(2)(c), (d) and (e)&mdash;are traditionally defined as exceptions to the hearsay rule, rule 801 defines such admission by a party-opponent as statements which are not hearsay. Consequently, rule 806 by referring exclusively to the admission of hearsay statements, does not appear to allow the credibility of the declarant to be attacked when the declarant is a coconspirator, agent or authorized spokesman. The committee is of the view that such statements should open the declarant to attacks on his credibility. Indeed, the reason such statements are excluded from the operation of rule 806 is likely attributable to the drafting technique used to codify the hearsay rule, viz some statements, instead of being referred to as exceptions to the hearsay rule, are defined as statements which are not hearsay. The phrase &ldquo;or a statement defined in rule 801(d)(2)(c), (d) and (e)&rdquo; is added to the rule in order to subject the declarant of such statements, like the declarant of hearsay statements, to attacks on his credibility. [The committee considered it unnecessary to include statements contained in rule 801(d)(2)(A) and (B)&mdash;the statement by the party-opponent himself or the statement of which he has manifested his adoption&mdash;because the credibility of the party-opponent is always subject to an attack on his credibility].</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment permits an attack upon the credibility of the declarant of a statement if the statement is one by a person authorized by a party-opponent to make a statement concerning the subject, one by an agent of a party-opponent, or one by a coconspirator of the party-opponent, as these statements are defined in Rules 801(d)(2)(C), (D) and (E). The House bill has no such provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment conforms the rule to present practice.</p>
