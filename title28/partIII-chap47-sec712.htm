<p class="note-body">Provision of section 222a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to compensation of law clerks is incorporated in section 604 of this title. (See reviser's note under such section.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;with the approval of the Attorney General,&rdquo; were omitted to confer on circuit judges the same authority given Supreme Court justices under section 675 of this title.</p>
