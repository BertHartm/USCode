<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Where in private practice he served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A judge should inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;financial interest&rdquo; means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a &ldquo;financial interest&rdquo; in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any justice, judge, magistrate judge, or bankruptcy judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her, that he or she individually or as a fiduciary, or his or her spouse or minor child residing in his or her household, has a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the justice, judge, magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, spouse or minor child, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provisions in section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that where court is held &ldquo;at more than one place&rdquo; and the place of keeping the records &ldquo;is not specially provided by law, they shall be kept at either of the places&rdquo; designated by the court, was changed to permit the judicial councils of the circuits to make the determination without requiring special enactment of Congress. See section 332 of this title as to purpose and duties of the judicial councils.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of section 523a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing destruction of records by the Attorney General was rewritten in the second paragraph to give such authority, respecting court records, to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Such Director, under section 604 of this title, now exercises administrative authority over clerks and commissioners.</p>
<p class="note-body">A similar provision with respect to records of United States attorneys and marshals was omitted as superseded by sections 366 and 380 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents, which prescribe the exclusive method for disposition of such papers.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision of section 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., giving to &ldquo;all courts of the United States&rdquo; power to impose and administer all necessary oaths is the only part of such section in this title.
