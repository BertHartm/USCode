<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Remand.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Issuance of Remand Order.</strong> At the request of a party or on its own motion, the court may in any case within its jurisdiction by order remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as may be deemed proper and just.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Content of Remand Order.</strong> An order of remand shall (A) delineate the area of further consideration or action deemed warranted on the remand, (B) fix the duration of the remand period, not to exceed 6 months, and (C) specify the extent to which court proceedings shall be stayed during the remand period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Service of Order.</strong> A certified copy of any order issued pursuant to this rule shall be served by the clerk on the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order is directed. A copy of the order shall be served on each party in conformity with RCFC 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Transmittal of Administrative Record.</strong> Following service of the order as provided for in this rule, the clerk shall transmit the administrative record, if any, to the Department of Justice for return to the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order of remand is directed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Advice of Administrative Action.</strong> In every case in which an order of remand is entered pursuant to this rule, the attorney of record for the party so designated in the order of remand shall report to the court the status of proceedings on remand at intervals of 90 days or less, beginning with the date of the order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Extension or Termination of Stay of Proceedings on Remand; Disposition of Case.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Extension.</strong> If the administrative or executive body or official has not, during the period of stay provided for in an order of remand pursuant to subdivision (a), rendered a decision on the matter remanded, the party to whom opportunity was afforded to obtain further administrative consideration shall, by motion pursuant to RCFC 6, request an extension of the stay of proceedings, or, by motion pursuant to RCFC 7, request the initiation of proceedings toward otherwise disposing of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Disposition at Administrative Level.</strong> If, during the period of the stay of proceedings as provided for in a remand order, the parties dispose of the case at the administrative level, the plaintiff shall file a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Decision on Remand.</strong> Upon completion of proceedings pursuant to an order of remand under subdivision (a), the administrative or executive body or official to whom the order was directed shall forward to the clerk for filing 4 copies of the decision or final action on remand. A copy of such decision or action shall be served on each party by the clerk.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:428 --><p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Action by the Parties.</strong> Within 30 days after the filing of a decision or final action pursuant to subdivision (3), each party shall file with the clerk a notice indicating whether or not the decision or final action on remand affords a satisfactory basis for disposition of the claim at the administrative level, or whether further proceedings before the court are deemed required, and, if such proceedings are desired, what those proceedings should be. A copy of such notice shall be served on each adverse party in conformity with RCFC 5. Thereafter, the court will enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed, either specially or pursuant to the rules of the court, or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 56.2 has no FRCP counterpart. The rule formerly appeared in these rules as RCFC 60.1. The renumbering of RCFC 60.1 is intended to reflect its more logical placement in the organizational structure of the court's rules.</p>
