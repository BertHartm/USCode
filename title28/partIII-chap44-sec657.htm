<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Action restored to court docket</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon a demand for a trial de novo, the action shall be restored to the docket of the court and treated for all purposes as if it had not been referred to arbitration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of evidence of arbitration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall not admit at the trial de novo any evidence that there has been an arbitration proceeding, the nature or amount of any award, or any other matter concerning the conduct of the arbitration proceeding, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the evidence would otherwise be admissible in the court under the Federal Rules of Evidence; or</p>
