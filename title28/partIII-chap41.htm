<p class="note-body">For purposes of uniformity, all provisions of law governing the regulation and allowance of office, travel, and subsistence expenses of all officers and employees of the courts, except those provisions relating to Supreme Court officers and employees, are incorporated in subsection (a)(6)(7) of this section. Likewise the provisions respecting the compensation of court officers and employees, except those of the Supreme Court, are incorporated in subsection (a)(5). In each instance the power to fix and determine such salaries and expenses is transferred to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. This change is in conformity with the Administrative Office Act 1939 included in this chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">Compensation of bailiffs however is provided by sections 713 and 755 of this title and that of court reporters by section 753 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Salaries and travel expenses of Court of Claims Commissioners are covered by section 792 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language &ldquo;and the lawful fees of United States Commissioners&rdquo; in subsection (a)(6) and &ldquo;the offices of the United States Commissioners&rdquo; in subsection (a)(9) is new. It conforms with sections 633, 636 and 639 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and officers and employees of the Administrative Office&rdquo; were added in subsection (a)(7) to expressly authorize travel and subsistence expenses of such officers and employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The power to fix such pay and allowances is transferred to the Director as above indicated, and conforms with the Administrative Office Act of 1939. For further explanation of the general supervision of probation officers, see reviser's note under section 3654, H. Rept. to accompany H.R. 3190 for revision of title 18, U.S.C.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(8) covers the provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C. 1940 ed. Such section 1131 authorized the Tax Court, successor to the Board of Tax Appeals, to make expenditures for personal services, rent, law books, reference books, periodicals, and provided that all expenditures should be paid out of appropriations for the Tax Court, on itemized vouchers approved by the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two references to &ldquo;officials and employees covered by this chapter&rdquo; were changed to &ldquo;clerical and administrative personnel,&rdquo; following the language of paragraph (a)(1), conferring general power to supervise such personnel as respects administrative matters.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar language was used in paragraph (b) instead of &ldquo;The clerks of the district courts, their deputies and assistants, and all other employees of said courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of section 374b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., based on successive acts relating to classification and compensation of secretaries and law clerks were omitted as temporary and unnecessary in revision, in view of subsection (a)(5) of this section under which the salaries of all personnel are necessarily limited by current appropriation acts.</p>
<p class="note-body">For increases in basic rates of compensation for other judicial officers and employees see, also, section 521 of Act June 30, 1945, ch. 212.</p>
<p class="note-body">The designation &ldquo;senior circuit judges&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;chief judges of the circuits&rdquo; in conformity with section 45 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions of section 11&ndash;204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., relating to appointment of clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and deputy clerk, crier, and messenger thereof, and the provisions relating to accounting for fees, are incorporated in sections 711 and 713 of this title. Provisions of said section, requiring the clerk of such court to give bond, were omitted as covered by section 952 of this title. Provisions of said section, relating to regulation of clerk's fees by such court were omitted so as to render uniform the method of such regulation as prescribed by section 1913 of this title, and the provisions of said section, placing a maximum of five hundred dollars per year on the office expenditures of the clerk of such court, were omitted as inconsistent with this consolidated section.</p>
<p class="note-body">For distribution of other provisions of sections on which this section is based, see Distribution Table.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Senate Revision Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated, therefore, as finally enacted, sections 1130(a)(b) and 1131 of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code [1940 ed.], did not constitute part of the source of this section. However, no change in the text of the section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.</p>
<p class="note-body">As finally enacted, part of act July 9, 1947, ch. 211, title IV, 61 Stat. 304, 305, which was classified to title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;374b, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment.

A Director who elects coverage under this section shall be deemed an &ldquo;employee&rdquo; for purposes of chapter 84 of title 5, subchapter III, regardless of whether he has waived the coverage of chapter 83, subchapter III, or chapter 84. Waiver of coverage under chapter 83, subchapter III, and election of this section shall not operate to foreclose to the Director, upon separation from service other than by retirement, such opportunity as the law may provide to secure retirement credit under chapter 83 for service as Director by depositing with interest the amount required by section 8334 of title 5. A Director who waives coverage under chapter 84 and elects this section may secure retirement credit under chapter 84 for service as Director by depositing with interest 1.3 percent of basic pay for service from January 1, 1984, through December 31, 1986, and the amount referred to in section 8422(a) of title 5, for service after December 31, 1986.

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the retirement of a Director who has elected coverage under this section and who has at least ten years of service, but who is not eligible to receive an annuity under the first paragraph of this subsection, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall pay him an annuity for life equal to that proportion of 80 per centum of the salary of the office at the time of his retirement that the number of years of his service bears to fifteen, reduced by one-quarter of 1 per centum for each full month, if any, he is under the age of sixty-five at the time of separation from service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A Director who has elected coverage under this section and who becomes permanently disabled to perform the duties of his office shall be retired and shall receive an annuity for life equal to 80 per centum of the salary of the office at the time of his retirement if he has at least fifteen years of service, or equal to that proportion of 80 percentum of such salary that the aggregate number of years of his service bears to fifteen if he has less than fifteen years of service, but in no event less than 50 per centum of such salary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) For the purpose of this section, &ldquo;service&rdquo; means service, whether or not continuous, as Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and any service, not to exceed five years, as a judge of the United States, a Senator or Representative in Congress, a congressional employee in the capacity of primary administrative assistant to a Member of Congress or in the capacity of staff director or chief counsel for the majority or the minority of a committee or subcommittee of the Senate or House of Representatives, or a civilian official appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each annuity payable under this section shall be increased by the same percentage amount and effective on the same date as annuities payable under chapter 83 of title 5, are increased as provided by section 8340 of title 5.</p>
