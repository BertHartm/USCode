<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">The exceptions are phrased in terms of nonapplication of the hearsay rule, rather than in positive terms of admissibility, in order to repel any implication that other possible grounds for exclusion are eliminated from consideration.</p>
<p class="note-body">The present rule proceeds upon the theory that under appropriate circumstances a hearsay statement may possess circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to justify nonproduction of the declarant in person at the trial even though he may be available. The theory finds vast support in the many exceptions to the hearsay rule developed by the common law in which unavailability of the declarant is not a relevant factor. The present rule is a synthesis of them, with revision where modern developments and conditions are believed to make that course appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">In a hearsay situation, the declarant is, of course, a witness, and neither this rule nor Rule 804 dispenses with the requirement of firsthand knowledge. It may appear from his statement or be inferable from circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Rule 602.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exceptions (1) and (2). In considerable measure these two examples overlap, though based on somewhat different theories. The most significant practical difference will lie in the time lapse allowable between event and statement.</p>
<p class="note-body">The underlying theory of Exception [paragraph] (1) is that substantial contemporaneity of event and statement negative the likelihood of deliberate of conscious misrepresentation. Moreover, if the witness is the declarant, he may be examined on the statement. If the witness is not the declarant, he may be examined as to the circumstances as an aid in evaluating the statement. Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 340&ndash;341 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">The theory of Exception [paragraph] (2) is simply that circumstances may produce a condition of excitement which temporarily stills the capacity of reflection and produces utterances free of conscious fabrication. 6 Wigmore &sect;1747, p. 135. Spontaneity is the key factor in each instance, though arrived at by somewhat different routes. Both are needed in order to avoid needless niggling.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the theory of Exception [paragraph] (2) has been criticized on the ground that excitement impairs accuracy of observation as well as eliminating conscious fabrication, Hutchins and Slesinger, Some Observations on the Law of Evidence: Spontaneous Exclamations, 28 Colum.L.Rev. 432 (1928), it finds support in cases without number. See cases in 6 Wigmore &sect;1750; Annot., 53 A.L.R.2d 1245 (statements as to cause of or responsibility for motor vehicle accident); Annot., 4 A.L.R.3d 149 (accusatory statements by homicide victims). Since unexciting events are less likely to evoke comment, decisions involving Exception [paragraph] (1) are far less numerous. Illustrative are <em>Tampa Elec. Co. v. Getrost</em>, 151 Fla. 558, 10 So.2d 83 (1942); <em>Houston Oxygen Co. v. Davis</em>, 139 Tex. 1, 161 S.W.2d 474 (1942); and cases cited in McCormick &sect;273, p. 585, n. 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">With respect to the <em>time element</em>, Exception [paragraph] (1) recognizes that in many, if not most, instances precise contemporaneity is not possible, and hence a slight lapse is allowable. Under Exception [paragraph] (2) the standard of measurement is the duration of the state of excitement. &ldquo;How long can excitement prevail? Obviously there are no pat answers and the character of the transaction or event will largely determine the significance of the time factor.&rdquo; Slough, Spontaneous Statements and State of Mind, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 224, 243 (1961); McCormick &sect;272, p. 580.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Participation</em> by the declarant is not required: a nonparticipant may be moved to describe what he perceives, and one may be startled by an event in which he is not an actor. Slough, <em>supra</em>; McCormick, <em>supra</em>; 6 Wigmore &sect;1755; Annot., 78 A.L.R.2d 300.</p>
<p class="note-body">Whether <em>proof of the startling event</em> may be made by the statement itself is largely an academic question, since in most cases there is present at least circumstantial evidence that something of a startling nature must have occurred. For cases in which the evidence consists of the condition of the declarant (injuries, state of shock), see <em>Insurance Co. v. Mosely</em>, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.), 397, 19 L.Ed. 437 (1869); <em>Wheeler v. United States</em>, 93 U.S.A.App. D.C. 159, 211 F.2d 19 (1953); cert. denied 347 U.S. 1019, 74 S.Ct. 876, 98 L.Ed. 1140; <em>Wetherbee v. Safety Casualty Co</em>., 219 F.2d 274 (5th Cir. 1955); <em>Lampe v. United States</em>, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 229 F.2d 43 (1956). Nevertheless, on occasion the only evidence may be the content of the statement itself, and rulings that it may be sufficient are described as &ldquo;increasing,&rdquo; Slough, <em>supra</em> at 246, and as the &ldquo;prevailing practice,&rdquo; McCormick &sect;272, p. 579. Illustrative are <em>Armour & Co. v. Industrial Commission</em>, 78 Colo. 569, 243 P. 546 (1926); <em>Young v. Stewart</em>, 191 N.C. 297, 131 S.E. 735 (1926). Moreover, under Rule 104(a) the judge is not limited by the hearsay rule in passing upon preliminary questions of fact.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proof of declarant's perception by his statement presents similar considerations when declarant is identified. <em>People v. Poland</em>, 22 Ill.2d 175, 174 N.E.2d 804 (1961). However, when declarant is an unidentified bystander, the cases indicate hesitancy in upholding the statement alone as sufficient, <em>Garrett v. Howden</em>, 73 N.M. 307, 387 P.2d 874 (1963); <em>Beck v. Dye</em>, 200 Wash. 1, 92 P.2d 1113 (1939), a result which would under appropriate circumstances be consistent with the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Permissible <em>subject matter</em> of the statement is limited under Exception [paragraph] (1) to description or explanation of the event or condition, the assumption being that spontaneity, in the absence of a startling event, may extend no farther. In Exception [paragraph] (2), however, the statement need only &ldquo;relate&rdquo; to the startling event or condition, thus affording a broader scope of subject matter coverage. 6 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1750, 1754. See <em>Sanitary Grocery Co. v. Snead</em>, 67 App.D.C. 129, 90 F.2d 374 (1937), slip-and-fall case sustaining admissibility of clerk's statement, &ldquo;That has been on the floor for a couple of hours,&rdquo; and <em>Murphy Auto Parts Co., Inc. v. Ball</em>, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 416, 249 F.2d 508 (1957), upholding admission, on issue of driver's agency, of his statement that he had to call on a customer and was in a hurry to get home. Quick, Hearsay, Excitement, Necessity and the Uniform Rules: A Reappraisal of Rule 63(4), 6 Wayne L.Rev. 204, 206&ndash;209 (1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 63(4)(a) and (b); California Evidence Code &sect;1240 (as to Exception (2) only); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(d)(1) and (2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (3) is essentially a specialized application of Exception [paragraph] (1), presented separately to <!-- PDFPage:308 -->enhance its usefulness and accessibility. See McCormick &sect;&sect;265, 268.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exclusion of &ldquo;statements of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed&rdquo; is necessary to avoid the virtual destruction of the hearsay rule which would otherwise result from allowing state of mind, provable by a hearsay statement, to serve as the basis for an inference of the happening of the event which produced the state of mind). <em>Shepard v. United States</em>, 290 U.S. 96, 54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196 (1933); Maguire, The Hillmon Case&mdash;Thirty-three Years After, 38 Harv.L.Rev. 709, 719&ndash;731 (1925); Hinton, States of Mind and the Hearsay Rule, 1 U.Chi.L.Rev. 394, 421&ndash;423 (1934). The rule of <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillman</em>, 145 U.S. 285, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706 (1892), allowing evidence of intention as tending to prove the doing of the act intended, is of course, left undisturbed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The carving out, from the exclusion mentioned in the preceding paragraph, of declarations relating to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant's will represents an <em>ad hoc</em> judgment which finds ample reinforcement in the decisions, resting on practical grounds of necessity and expediency rather than logic. McCormick &sect;271, pp. 577&ndash;578; Annot., 34 A.L.R.2d 588, 62 A.L.R.2d 855. A similar recognition of the need for and practical value of this kind of evidence is found in California Evidence Code &sect;1260.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (4). Even those few jurisdictions which have shied away from generally admitting statements of present condition have allowed them if made to a physician for purposes of diagnosis and treatment in view of the patient's strong motivation to be truthful. McCormick &sect;266, p. 563. The same guarantee of trustworthiness extends to statements of past conditions and medical history, made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment. It also extends to statements as to causation, reasonably pertinent to the same purposes, in accord with the current trend, <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Industrial Commission</em>, 2 Ill.2d 590, 119 N.E.2d 224 (1954); McCormick &sect;266, p. 564; New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(12)(c). Statements as to fault would not ordinarily qualify under this latter language. Thus a patient's statement that he was struck by an automobile would qualify but not his statement that the car was driven through a red light. Under the exception the statement need not have been made to a physician. Statements to hospital attendants, ambulance drivers, or even members of the family might be included.</p>
<p class="note-body">Conventional doctrine has excluded from the hearsay exception, as not within its guarantee of truthfulness, statements to a physician consulted only for the purpose of enabling him to testify. While these statements were not admissible as substantive evidence, the expert was allowed to state the basis of his opinion, including statements of this kind. The distinction thus called for was one most unlikely to be made by juries. The rule accordingly rejects the limitation. This position is consistent with the provision of Rule 703 that the facts on which expert testimony is based need not be admissible in evidence if of a kind ordinarily relied upon by experts in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (5). A hearsay exception for recorded recollection is generally recognized and has been described as having &ldquo;long been favored by the federal and practically all the state courts that have had occasion to decide the question.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Kelly</em>, 349 F.2d 720, 770 (2d Cir. 1965), citing numerous cases and sustaining the exception against a claimed denial of the right of confrontation. Many additional cases are cited in Annot., 82 A.L.R.2d 473, 520. The guarantee of trustworthiness is found in the reliability inherent in a record made while events were still fresh in mind and accurately reflecting them. <em>Owens v. State</em>, 67 Md. 307, 316, 10 A. 210, 212 (1887).</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal controversy attending the exception has centered, not upon the propriety of the exception itself, but upon the question whether a preliminary requirement of impaired memory on the part of the witness should be imposed. The authorities are divided. If regard be had only to the accuracy of the evidence, admittedly impairment of the memory of the witness adds nothing to it and should not be required. McCormick &sect;277, p. 593; 3 Wigmore &sect;738, p. 76; <em>Jordan v. People</em>, 151 Colo. 133, 376 P.2d 699 (1962), cert. denied 373 U.S. 944, 83 S.Ct. 1553, 10 L.Ed.2d 699; <em>Hall v. State</em>, 223 Md. 158, 162 A.2d 751 (1960); <em>State v. Bindhammer</em>, 44 N.J. 372, 209 A.2d 124 (1965). Nevertheless, the absence of the requirement, it is believed, would encourage the use of statements carefully prepared for purposes of litigation under the supervision of attorneys, investigators, or claim adjusters. Hence the example includes a requirement that the witness not have &ldquo;sufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately.&rdquo; To the same effect are California Evidence Code &sect;1237 and New Jersey Rule 63(1)(b), and this has been the position of the federal courts. <em>Vicksburg & Meridian R.R. v. O'Brien</em>, 119 U.S. 99, 7 S.Ct. 118, 30 L.Ed. 299 (1886); <em>Ahern v. Webb</em>, 268 F.2d 45 (10th Cir. 1959); and see <em>N.L.R.B. v. Hudson Pulp and Paper Corp</em>., 273 F.2d 660, 665 (5th Cir. 1960); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Federal Dairy Co</em>., 297 F.2d 487 (1st Cir. 1962). But cf. <em>United States v. Adams</em>, 385 F.2d 548 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">No attempt is made in the exception to spell out the method of establishing the initial knowledge or the contemporaneity and accuracy of the record, leaving them to be dealt with as the circumstances of the particular case might indicate. Multiple person involvement in the process of observing and recording, as in <em>Rathbun v. Brancatella</em>, 93 N.J.L. 222, 107 A. 279 (1919), is entirely consistent with the exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">Locating the exception at this place in the scheme of the rules is a matter of choice. There were two other possibilities. The first was to regard the statement as one of the group of prior statements of a testifying witness which are excluded entirely from the category of hearsay by Rule 801(d)(1). That category, however, requires that declarant be &ldquo;subject to cross-examination,&rdquo; as to which the impaired memory aspect of the exception raises doubts. The other possibility was to include the exception among those covered by Rule 804. Since unavailability is required by that rule and lack of memory is listed as a species of unavailability by the definition of the term in Rule 804(a)(3), that treatment at first impression would seem appropriate. The fact is, however, that the unavailability requirement of the exception is of a limited and peculiar nature. Accordingly, the exception is located at this point rather than in the context of a rule where unavailability is conceived of more broadly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (6) represents an area which has received much attention from those seeking to improve the law of evidence. The Commonwealth Fund Act was the result of a study completed in 1927 by a distinguished committee under the chairmanship of Professor Morgan. Morgan et al., The Law of Evidence: Some Proposals for its Reform 63 (1927). With changes too minor to mention, it was adopted by Congress in 1936 as the rule for federal courts. 28 U.S.C. &sect;1732. A number of states took similar action. The Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1936 promulgated the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, 9A U.L.A. 506, which has acquired a substantial following in the states. Model Code Rule 514 and Uniform Rule 63(13) also deal with the subject. Difference of varying degrees of importance exist among these various treatments.</p>
<p class="note-body">These reform efforts were largely within the context of business and commercial records, as the kind usually encountered, and concentrated considerable attention upon relaxing the requirement of producing as witnesses, or accounting for the nonproduction of, all participants in the process of gathering, transmitting, and recording information which the common law had evolved as a burdensome and crippling aspect of using records of this type. In their areas of primary emphasis on witnesses to be called and the general admissibility of ordinary business and commercial records, the Commonwealth Fund Act and the Uniform Act appear to have worked well. The exception seeks to preserve their advantages.</p>
<p class="note-body">On the subject of what witnesses must be called, the Commonwealth Fund Act eliminated the common law <!-- PDFPage:309 -->requirement of calling or accounting for all participants by failing to mention it. <em>United States v. Mortimer</em>, 118 F.2d 266 (2d Cir. 1941); <em>La Porte v. United States</em>, 300 F.2d 878 (9th Cir. 1962); McCormick &sect;290, p. 608. Model Code Rule 514 and Uniform Rule 63(13) did likewise. The Uniform Act, however, abolished the common law requirement in express terms, providing that the requisite foundation testimony might be furnished by &ldquo;the custodian or other qualified witness.&rdquo; Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, &sect;2; 9A U.L.A. 506. The exception follows the Uniform Act in this respect.</p>
<p class="note-body">The element of unusual reliability of business records is said variously to be supplied by systematic checking, by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation. McCormick &sect;&sect;281, 286, 287; Laughlin, Business Entries and the Like, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 276 (1961). The model statutes and rules have sought to capture these factors and to extend their impact by employing the phrase &ldquo;regular course of business,&rdquo; in conjunction with a definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; far broader than its ordinarily accepted meaning. The result is a tendency unduly to emphasize a requirement of routineness and repetitiveness and an insistence that other types of records be squeezed into the fact patterns which give rise to traditional business records. The rule therefore adopts the phrase &ldquo;the course of a regularly conducted activity&rdquo; as capturing the essential basis of the hearsay exception as it has evolved and the essential element which can be abstracted from the various specifications of what is a &ldquo;business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Amplification of the kinds of activities producing admissible records has given rise to problems which conventional business records by their nature avoid. They are problems of the source of the recorded information, of entries in opinion form, of motivation, and of involvement as participant in the matters recorded.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sources of information presented no substantial problem with ordinary business records. All participants, including the observer or participant furnishing the information to be recorded, were acting routinely, under a duty of accuracy, with employer reliance on the result, or in short &ldquo;in the regular course of business.&rdquo; If, however, the supplier of the information does not act in the regular course, an essential link is broken; the assurance of accuracy does not extend to the information itself, and the fact that it may be recorded with scrupulous accuracy is of no avail. An illustration is the police report incorporating information obtained from a bystander: the officer qualifies as acting in the regular course but the informant does not. The leading case, <em>Johnson v. Lutz</em>, 253 N.Y. 124, 170 N.E. 517 (1930), held that a report thus prepared was inadmissible. Most of the authorities have agreed with the decision. <em>Gencarella v. Fyfe</em>, 171 F.2d 419 (1st Cir. 1948); <em>Gordon v. Robinson</em>, 210 F.2d 192 (3d Cir. 1954); <em>Standard Oil Co. of California v. Moore</em>, 251 F.2d 188, 214 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 975, 78 S.Ct. 1139, 2 L.Ed.2d 1148; <em>Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc</em>., 249 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.N.Y. 1965); Annot., 69 A.L.R.2d 1148. Cf. <em>Hawkins v. Gorea Motor Express, Inc</em>., 360 F.2d 933 (2d Cir 1966). <em>Contra</em>, 5 Wigmore &sect;1530a, n. 1, pp. 391&ndash;392. The point is not dealt with specifically in the Commonwealth Fund Act, the Uniform Act, or Uniform Rule 63(13). However, Model Code Rule 514 contains the requirement &ldquo;that it was the regular course of that business for one with personal knowledge *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to make such a memorandum or record or to transmit information thereof to be included in such a memorandum or record *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; The rule follows this lead in requiring an informant with knowledge acting in the course of the regularly conducted activity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Entries in the form of opinions were not encountered in traditional business records in view of the purely factual nature of the items recorded, but they are now commonly encountered with respect to medical diagnoses, prognoses, and test results, as well as occasionally in other areas. The Commonwealth Fund Act provided only for records of an &ldquo;act, transaction, occurrence, or event,&rdquo; while the Uniform Act, Model Code Rule 514, and Uniform Rule 63(13) merely added the ambiguous term &ldquo;condition.&rdquo; The limited phrasing of the Commonwealth Fund Act, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1732, may account for the reluctance of some federal decisions to admit diagnostic entries. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor</em>, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 147 F.2d 297 (1945); <em>Lyles v. United States</em>, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 254 F.2d 725 (1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 961, 78 S.Ct. 997, 2 L.Ed.2d 1067; <em>England v. United States</em>, 174 F.2d 466 (5th Cir. 1949); <em>Skogen v. Dow Chemical Co</em>., 375 F.2d 692 (8th Cir. 1967). Other federal decisions, however, experienced no difficulty in freely admitting diagnostic entries. <em>Reed v. Order of United Commercial Travelers</em>, 123 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1941); <em>Buckminster's Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</em>, 147 F.2d 331 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>Medina v. Erickson</em>, 226 F.2d 475 (9th Cir. 1955); <em>Thomas v. Hogan</em>, 308 F.2d 355 (4th Cir. 1962); <em>Glawe v. Rulon</em>, 284 F.2d 495 (8th Cir. 1960). In the state courts, the trend favors admissibility. <em>Borucki v. MacKenzie Bros. Co</em>., 125 Conn. 92, 3 A.2d 224 (1938); <em>Allen v. St. Louis Public Service Co</em>., 365 Mo. 677, 285 S.W.2d 663, 55 A.L.R.2d 1022 (1956); <em>People v. Kohlmeyer</em>, 284 N.Y. 366, 31 N.E.2d 490 (1940); <em>Weis v. Weis</em>, 147 Ohio St. 416, 72 N.E.2d 245 (1947). In order to make clear its adherence to the latter position, the rule specifically includes both diagnoses and opinions, in addition to acts, events, and conditions, as proper subjects of admissible entries.</p>
<p class="note-body">Problems of the motivation of the informant have been a source of difficulty and disagreement. In <em>Palmer v. Hoffman</em>, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), exclusion of an accident report made by the since deceased engineer, offered by defendant railroad trustees in a grade crossing collision case, was upheld. The report was not &ldquo;in the regular course of business,&rdquo; not a record of the systematic conduct of the business as a business, said the Court. The report was prepared for use in litigating, not railroading. While the opinion mentions the motivation of the engineer only obliquely, the emphasis on records of routine operations is significant only by virtue of impact on motivation to be accurate. Absence of routineness raises lack of motivation to be accurate. The opinion of the Court of Appeals had gone beyond mere lack of motive to be accurate: the engineer's statement was &ldquo;dripping with motivations to misrepresent.&rdquo; <em>Hoffman v. Palmer</em>, 129 F.2d 976, 991 (2d Cir. 1942). The direct introduction of motivation is a disturbing factor, since absence of motivation to misrepresent has not traditionally been a requirement of the rule; that records might be self-serving has not been a ground for exclusion. Laughlin, Business Records and the Like, 46 Iowa L.Rev. 276, 285 (1961). As Judge Clark said in his dissent, &ldquo;I submit that there is hardly a grocer's account book which could not be excluded on that basis.&rdquo; 129 F.2d at 1002. A physician's evaluation report of a personal injury litigant would appear to be in the routine of his business. If the report is offered by the party at whose instance it was made, however, it has been held inadmissible, <em>Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc</em>., 249 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.N.Y. 1965), otherwise if offered by the opposite party, <em>Korte v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co</em>., 191 F.2d 86 (2d Cir. 1951), cert. denied 342 U.S. 868, 72 S.Ct. 108, 96 L.Ed. 652.</p>
<p class="note-body">The decisions hinge on motivation and which party is entitled to be concerned about it. Professor McCormick believed that the doctor's report or the accident report were sufficiently routine to justify admissibility. McCormick &sect;287, p. 604. Yet hesitation must be experienced in admitting everything which is observed and recorded in the course of a regularly conducted activity. Efforts to set a limit are illustrated by <em>Hartzog v. United States</em>, 217 F.2d 706 (4th Cir. 1954), error to admit worksheets made by since deceased deputy collector in preparation for the instant income tax evasion prosecution, and <em>United States v. Ware</em>, 247 F.2d 698 (7th Cir. 1957), error to admit narcotics agents&rsquo; records of purchases. See also Exception [paragraph] (8), <em>infra</em>, as to the public record aspects of records of this nature. Some decisions have been satisfied as to motivation of an accident report if made pursuant to statutory duty, <!-- PDFPage:310 --><em>United States v. New York Foreign Trade Zone Operators</em>, 304 F.2d 792 (2d Cir. 1962); <em>Taylor v. Baltimore & O. R. Co</em>., 344 F.2d 281 (2d Cir. 1965), since the report was oriented in a direction other than the litigation which ensued. Cf. <em>Matthews v. United States</em>, 217 F.2d 409 (5th Cir. 1954). The formulation of specific terms which would assure satisfactory results in all cases is not possible. Consequently the rule proceeds from the base that records made in the course of a regularly conducted activity will be taken as admissible but subject to authority to exclude if &ldquo;the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Occasional decisions have reached for enhanced accuracy by requiring involvement as a participant in matters reported. <em>Clainos v. United States</em>, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 278, 163 F.2d 593 (1947), error to admit police records of convictions; <em>Standard Oil Co. of California v. Moore</em>, 251 F.2d 188 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 975, 78 S.Ct. 1139, 2 L.Ed.2d 1148, error to admit employees&rsquo; records of observed business practices of others. The rule includes no requirement of this nature. Wholly acceptable records may involve matters merely observed, e.g. the weather.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form which the &ldquo;record&rdquo; may assume under the rule is described broadly as a &ldquo;memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;data compilation&rdquo; is used as broadly descriptive of any means of storing information other than the conventional words and figures in written or documentary form. It includes, but is by no means limited to, electronic computer storage. The term is borrowed from revised Rule 34(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (7). Failure of a record to mention a matter which would ordinarily be mentioned is satisfactory evidence of its nonexistence. Uniform Rule 63(14), Comment. While probably not hearsay as defined in Rule 801, <em>supra</em>, decisions may be found which class the evidence not only as hearsay but also as not within any exception. In order to set the question at rest in favor of admissibility, it is specifically treated here. McCormick &sect;289, p. 609; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 314 (1962); 5 Wigmore &sect;1531; Uniform Rule 63(14); California Evidence Code &sect;1272; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(n); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(14).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (8). Public records are a recognized hearsay exception at common law and have been the subject of statutes without number. McCormick &sect;291. See, for example, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1733, the relative narrowness of which is illustrated by its nonapplicability to nonfederal public agencies, thus necessitating report to the less appropriate business record exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Kay v. United States</em>, 255 F.2d 476 (4th Cir. 1958). The rule makes no distinction between federal and nonfederal offices and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Justification for the exception is the assumption that a public official will perform his duty properly and the unlikelihood that he will remember details independently of the record. <em>Wong Wing Foo v. McGrath</em>, 196 F.2d 120 (9th Cir. 1952), and see <em>Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States</em>, 250 U.S. 123, 39 S.Ct. 407, 63 L.Ed. 889 (1919). As to items (a) and (b), further support is found in the reliability factors underlying records of regularly conducted activities generally. See Exception [paragraph] (6), supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Cases illustrating the admissibility of records of the office's or agency's own activities are numerous. <em>Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co. v. United States</em>, 250 U.S. 123, 39 S.Ct. 407, 63 L.Ed. 889 (1919), Treasury records of miscellaneous receipts and disbursements; <em>Howard v. Perrin</em>, 200 U.S. 71, 26 S.Ct. 195, 50 I.Ed. 374 (1906), General Land Office records; <em>Ballew v. United States</em>, 160 U.S. 187, 16 S.Ct. 263, 40 L.Ed. 388 (1895), Pension Office records.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Cases sustaining admissibility of records of matters observed are also numerous. <em>United States v. Van Hook</em>, 284 F.2d 489 (7th Cir. 1960), remanded for resentencing 365 U.S. 609, 81 S.Ct. 823, 5 L.Ed.2d 821, letter from induction officer to District Attorney, pursuant to army regulations, stating fact and circumstances of refusal to be inducted; <em>T'Kach v. United States</em>, 242 F.2d 937 (5th Cir. 1957), affidavit of White House personnel officer that search of records showed no employment of accused, charged with fraudulently representing himself as an envoy of the President; <em>Minnehaha County v. Kelley</em>, 150 F.2d 356 (8th Cir. 1945); Weather Bureau records of rainfall; <em>United States v. Meyer</em>, 113 F.2d 387 (7th Cir. 1940), cert. denied 311 U.S. 706, 61 S.Ct. 174, 85 L.Ed. 459, map prepared by government engineer from information furnished by men working under his supervision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The more controversial area of public records is that of the so-called &ldquo;evaluative&rdquo; report. The disagreement among the decisions has been due in part, no doubt, to the variety of situations encountered, as well as to differences in principle. Sustaining admissibility are such cases as <em>United States v. Dumas</em>, 149 U.S. 278, 13 S.Ct. 872, 37 L.Ed. 734 (1893), statement of account certified by Postmaster General in action against postmaster; <em>McCarty v. United States</em>, 185 F.2d 520 (5th Cir. 1950), reh. denied 187 F.2d 234, Certificate of Settlement of General Accounting Office showing indebtedness and letter from Army official stating Government had performed, in action on contract to purchase and remove waste food from Army camp; <em>Moran v. Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co</em>., 183 F.2d 467 (3d Cir. 1950), report of Bureau of Mines as to cause of gas tank explosion; Petition of W&mdash;, 164 F.Supp. 659 (E.D.Pa.1958), report by Immigration and Naturalization Service investigator that petitioner was known in community as wife of man to whom she was not married. To the opposite effect and denying admissibility are <em>Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co</em>., 141 F.2d 568 (10th Cir. 1944), State Fire Marshal's report of cause of gas explosion; <em>Lomax Transp. Co. v. United States</em>, 183 F.2d 331 (9th Cir. 1950), Certificate of Settlement from General Accounting Office in action for naval supplies lost in warehouse fire; <em>Yung Jin Teung v. Dulles</em>, 229 F.2d 244 (2d Cir. 1956), &ldquo;Status Reports&rdquo; offered to justify delay in processing passport applications. Police reports have generally been excluded except to the extent to which they incorporate firsthand observations of the officer. Annot., 69 A.L.R.2d 1148. Various kinds of evaluative reports are admissible under federal statutes: 7 U.S.C. &sect;78, findings of Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence of true grade of grain; 7 U.S.C. &sect;210(f), findings of Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence in action for damages against stockyard owner; 7 U.S.C. &sect;292, order by Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence in judicial enforcement proceedings against producers association monopoly; 7 U.S.C. &sect;1622(h), Department of Agriculture inspection certificates of products shipped in interstate commerce prima facie evidence; 8 U.S.C. &sect;1440(c), separation of alien from military service on conditions other than honorable provable by certificate from department in proceedings to revoke citizenship; 18 U.S.C. &sect;4245, certificate of Director of Prisons that convicted person has been examined and found probably incompetent at time of trial prima facie evidence in court hearing on competency; 42 U.S.C. &sect;269(b), bill of health by appropriate official prima facie evidence of vessel's sanitary history and condition and compliance with regulations; 46 U.S.C. &sect;679, certificate of consul presumptive evidence of refusal of master to transport destitute seamen to United States. While these statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule are left undisturbed, Rule 802, the willingness of Congress to recognize a substantial measure of admissibility for evaluative reports is a helpful guide.</p>
<p class="note-body">Factors which may be of assistance in passing upon the admissibility of evaluative reports include; (1) the timeliness of the investigation, McCormack, Can the Courts Make Wider Use of Reports of Official Investigations? 42 Iowa L.Rev. 363 (1957); (2) the special skill or experience of the official, <em>id</em>., (3) whether a hearing was held and the level at which conducted, <em>Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co</em>., 141 F.2d 568 (10th Cir. 1944); (4) possible motivation problems suggested by <em>Palmer v. Hoffman</em>, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). Others no doubt could be added.</p>
<p class="note-body">The formulation of an approach which would give appropriate weight to all possible factors in every situa<!-- PDFPage:311 -->tion is an obvious impossibility. Hence the rule, as in Exception [paragraph] (6), assumes admissibility in the first instance but with ample provision for escape if sufficient negative factors are present. In one respect, however, the rule with respect to evaluate reports under item (c) is very specific; they are admissible only in civil cases and against the government in criminal cases in view of the almost certain collision with confrontation rights which would result from their use against the accused in a criminal case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (9). Records of vital statistics are commonly the subject of particular statutes making them admissible in evidence. Uniform Vital Statistics Act, 9C U.L.A. 350 (1957). The rule is in principle narrower than Uniform Rule 63(16) which includes reports required of persons performing functions authorized by statute, yet in practical effect the two are substantially the same. Comment Uniform Rule 63(16). The exception as drafted is in the pattern of California Evidence Code &sect;1281.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (10). The principle of proving nonoccurrence of an event by evidence of the absence of a record which would regularly be made of its occurrence, developed in Exception [paragraph] (7) with respect to regularly conducted activities, is here extended to public records of the kind mentioned in Exceptions [paragraphs] (8) and (9). 5 Wigmore &sect;1633(6), p. 519. Some harmless duplication no doubt exists with Exception [paragraph] (7). For instances of federal statutes recognizing this method of proof, see 8 U.S.C. &sect;1284(b), proof of absence of alien crewman's name from outgoing manifest prima facie evidence of failure to detain or deport, and 42 U.S.C. &sect;405(c)(3), (4)(B), (4)(C), absence of HEW [Department of Health, Education, and Welfare] record prima facie evidence of no wages or self-employment income.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule includes situations in which absence of a record may itself be the ultimate focal point of inquiry, e.g. <em>People v. Love</em>, 310 Ill. 558, 142 N.E. 204 (1923), certificate of Secretary of State admitted to show failure to file documents required by Securities Law, as well as cases where the absence of a record is offered as proof of the nonoccurrence of an event ordinarily recorded.</p>
<p class="note-body">The refusal of the common law to allow proof by certificate of the lack of a record or entry has no apparent justification, 5 Wigmore &sect;1678(7), p. 752. The rule takes the opposite position, as do Uniform Rule 63(17); California Evidence Code &sect;1284; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(<em>c</em>); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(17). Congress has recognized certification as evidence of the lack of a record. 8 U.S.C. &sect;1360(d), certificate of Attorney General or other designated officer that no record of Immigration and Naturalization Service of specified nature or entry therein is found, admissible in alien cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (11). Records of activities of religious organizations are currently recognized as admissible at least to the extent of the business records exception to the hearsay rule, 5 Wigmore &sect;1523, p. 371, and Exception [paragraph] (6) would be applicable. However, both the business record doctrine and Exception [paragraph] (6) require that the person furnishing the information be one in the business or activity. The result is such decisions as <em>Daily v. Grand Lodge</em>, 311 Ill. 184, 142 N.E. 478 (1924), holding a church record admissible to prove fact, date, and place of baptism, but not age of child except that he had at least been born at the time. In view of the unlikelihood that false information would be furnished on occasions of this kind, the rule contains no requirement that the informant be in the course of the activity. See California Evidence Code &sect;1315 and Comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (12). The principle of proof by certification is recognized as to public officials in Exceptions [paragraphs] (8) and (10), and with respect to authentication in Rule 902. The present exception is a duplication to the extent that it deals with a certificate by a public official, as in the case of a judge who performs a marriage ceremony. The area covered by the rule is, however, substantially larger and extends the certification procedure to clergymen and the like who perform marriages and other ceremonies or administer sacraments. Thus certificates of such matters as baptism or confirmation, as well as marriage, are included. In principle they are as acceptable evidence as certificates of public officers. See 5 Wigmore &sect;1645, as to marriage certificates. When the person executing the certificate is not a public official, the self-authenticating character of documents purporting to emanate from public officials, see Rule 902, is lacking and proof is required that the person was authorized and did make the certificate. The time element, however, may safely be taken as supplied by the certificate, once authority and authenticity are established, particularly in view of the presumption that a document was executed on the date it bears.</p>
<p class="note-body">For similar rules, some limited to certificates of marriage, with variations in foundation requirements, see Uniform Rule 63(18); California Evidence Code &sect;1316; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(p); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(18).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (13). Records of family history kept in family Bibles have by long tradition been received in evidence. 5 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1495, 1496, citing numerous statutes and decisions. See also Regulations, Social Security Administration, 20 C.F.R. &sect;404.703(c), recognizing family Bible entries as proof of age in the absence of public or church records. Opinions in the area also include inscriptions on tombstones, publicly displayed pedigrees, and engravings on rings. Wigmore, <em>supra</em>. The rule is substantially identical in coverage with California Evidence Code &sect;1312.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (14). The recording of title documents is a purely statutory development. Under any theory of the admissibility of public records, the records would be receivable as evidence of the contents of the recorded document, else the recording process would be reduced to a nullity. When, however, the record is offered for the further purpose of proving execution and delivery, a problem of lack of first-hand knowledge by the recorder, not present as to contents, is presented. This problem is solved, seemingly in all jurisdictions, by qualifying for recording only those documents shown by a specified procedure, either acknowledgement or a form of probate, to have been executed and delivered. 5 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1647&ndash;1651. Thus what may appear in the rule, at first glance, as endowing the record with an effect independently of local law and inviting difficulties of an <em>Erie</em> nature under <em>Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap</em>, 308 U.S. 208, 60 S.Ct. 201, 84 L.Ed. 196 (1939), is not present, since the local law in fact governs under the example.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (15). Dispositive documents often contain recitals of fact. Thus a deed purporting to have been executed by an attorney in fact may recite the existence of the power of attorney, or a deed may recite that the grantors are all the heirs of the last record owner. Under the rule, these recitals are exempted from the hearsay rule. The circumstances under which dispositive documents are executed and the requirement that the recital be germane to the purpose of the document are believed to be adequate guarantees of trustworthiness, particularly in view of the nonapplicability of the rule if dealings with the property have been inconsistent with the document. The age of the document is of no significance, though in practical application the document will most often be an ancient one. See Uniform Rule 63(29), Comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions are contained in Uniform Rule 63(29); California Evidence Code &sect;1330; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(aa); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(29).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (16). Authenticating a document as ancient, essentially in the pattern of the common law, as provided in Rule 901(b)(8), leaves open as a separate question the admissibility of assertive statements contained therein as against a hearsay objection. 7 Wigmore &sect;2145a. Wigmore further states that the ancient document technique of authentication is universally conceded to apply to all sorts of documents, including letters, records, contracts, maps, and certifi<!-- PDFPage:312 -->cates, in addition to title documents, citing numerous decisions. <em>Id</em>. &sect;2145. Since most of these items are significant evidentially only insofar as they are assertive, their admission in evidence must be as a hearsay exception. But see 5 <em>id</em>. &sect;1573, p. 429, referring to recitals in ancient deeds as a &ldquo;limited&rdquo; hearsay exception. The former position is believed to be the correct one in reason and authority. As pointed out in McCormick &sect;298, danger of mistake is minimized by authentication requirements, and age affords assurance that the writing antedates the present controversy. See <em>Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assurance Co</em>., 286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1961), upholding admissibility of 58-year-old newspaper story. Cf. Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 364 (1962), but see <em>id</em>. 254.</p>
<p class="note-body">For a similar provision, but with the added requirement that &ldquo;the statement has since generally been acted upon as true by persons having an interest in the matter,&rdquo; see California Evidence Code &sect;1331.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (17). Ample authority at common law supported the admission in evidence of items falling in this category. While Wigmore's text is narrowly oriented to lists, etc., prepared for the use of a trade or profession, 6 Wigmore &sect;1702, authorities are cited which include other kinds of publications, for example, newspaper market reports, telephone directories, and city directories. <em>Id</em>. &sect;&sect;1702&ndash;1706. The basis of trustworthiness is general reliance by the public or by a particular segment of it, and the motivation of the compiler to foster reliance by being accurate.</p>
<p class="note-body">For similar provisions, see Uniform Rule 63(30); California Evidence Code &sect;1340; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(bb); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(30). Uniform Commercial Code &sect;2&ndash;724 provides for admissibility in evidence of &ldquo;reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of such [established commodity] market.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (18). The writers have generally favored the admissibility of learned treatises, McCormick &sect;296, p. 621; Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 366 (1962); 6 Wigmore &sect;1692, with the support of occasional decisions and rules, <em>City of Dothan v. Hardy</em>, 237 Ala. 603, 188 So. 264 (1939); <em>Lewandowski v. Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co</em>., 33 Wis.2d 69, 146 N.W.2d 505 (1966), 66 Mich.L.Rev. 183 (1967); Uniform Rule 63(31); Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(ce), but the great weight of authority has been that learned treatises are not admissible as substantive evidence though usable in the cross-examination of experts. The foundation of the minority view is that the hearsay objection must be regarded as unimpressive when directed against treatises since a high standard of accuracy is engendered by various factors: the treatise is written primarily and impartially for professionals, subject to scrutiny and exposure for inaccuracy, with the reputation of the writer at stake. 6 Wigmore &sect;1692. Sound as this position may be with respect to trustworthiness, there is, nevertheless, an additional difficulty in the likelihood that the treatise will be misunderstood and misapplied without expert assistance and supervision. This difficulty is recognized in the cases demonstrating unwillingness to sustain findings relative to disability on the basis of judicially noticed medical texts. <em>Ross v. Gardner</em>, 365 F.2d 554 (6th Cir. 1966); <em>Sayers v. Gardner</em>, 380 F.2d 940 (6th Cir. 1967); <em>Colwell v. Gardner</em>, 386 F.2d 56 (6th Cir. 1967); <em>Glendenning v. Ribicoff</em>, 213 F.Supp. 301 (W.D.Mo. 1962); <em>Cook v. Celebrezze</em>, 217 F.Supp. 366 (W.D.Mo. 1963); <em>Sosna v. Celebrezze</em>, 234 F.Supp. 289 (E.D.Pa. 1964); and see <em>McDaniel v. Celebrezze</em>, 331 F.2d 426 (4th Cir. 1964). The rule avoids the danger of misunderstanding and misapplication by limiting the use of treatises as substantive evidence to situations in which an expert is on the stand and available to explain and assist in the application of the treatise if declared. The limitation upon receiving the publication itself physically in evidence, contained in the last sentence, is designed to further this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">The relevance of the use of treatises on cross-examination is evident. This use of treatises has been the subject of varied views. The most restrictive position is that the witness must have stated expressly on direct his reliance upon the treatise. A slightly more liberal approach still insists upon reliance but allows it to be developed on cross-examination. Further relaxation dispenses with reliance but requires recognition as an authority by the witness, developable on cross-examination. The greatest liberality is found in decisions allowing use of the treatise on cross-examination when its status as an authority is established by any means. Annot., 60 A.L.R.2d 77. The exception is hinged upon this last position, which is that of the Supreme Court, <em>Reilly v. Pinkus</em>, 338 U.S. 269, 70 S.Ct. 110, 94 L.Ed. 63 (1949), and of recent well considered state court decisions, <em>City of St. Petersburg v. Ferguson</em>, 193 So.2d 648 (Fla.App. 1967), cert. denied Fla., 201 So.2d 556; <em>Darling v. Charleston Memorial Community Hospital</em>, 33 Ill.2d 326, 211 N.E.2d 253 (1965); <em>Dabroe v. Rhodes Co</em>., 64 Wash.2d 431, 392 P.2d 317 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Reilly v. Pinkus, supra</em>, the Court pointed out that testing of professional knowledge was incomplete without exploration of the witness&rsquo; knowledge of and attitude toward established treatises in the field. The process works equally well in reverse and furnishes the basis of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not require that the witness rely upon or recognize the treatise as authoritative, thus avoiding the possibility that the expert may at the outset block cross-examination by refusing to concede reliance or authoritativeness. <em>Dabroe v. Rhodes Co., supra</em>. Moreover, the rule avoids the unreality of admitting evidence for the purpose of impeachment only, with an instruction to the jury not to consider it otherwise. The parallel to the treatment of prior inconsistent statements will be apparent. See Rules 6130(b) and 801(d)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exceptions (19), (20), and (21). Trustworthiness in reputation evidence is found &ldquo;when the topic is such that the facts are likely to have been inquired about and that persons having personal knowledge have disclosed facts which have thus been discussed in the community; and thus the community's conclusion, if any has been formed, is likely to be a trustworthy one.&rdquo; 5 Wigmore &sect;1580, p. 444, and see also &sect;1583. On this common foundation, reputation as to land boundaries, customs, general history, character, and marriage have come to be regarded as admissible. The breadth of the underlying principle suggests the formulation of an equally broad exception, but tradition has in fact been much narrower and more particularized, and this is the pattern of these exceptions in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception [paragraph] (19) is concerned with matters of personal and family history. Marriage is universally conceded to be a proper subject of proof by evidence of reputation in the community. 5 Wigmore &sect;1602. As to such items as legitimacy, relationship, adoption, birth, and death, the decisions are divided. <em>Id</em>. &sect;1605. All seem to be susceptible to being the subject of well founded repute. The &ldquo;world&rdquo; in which the reputation may exist may be family, associates, or community. This world has proved capable of expanding with changing times from the single uncomplicated neighborhood, in which all activities take place, to the multiple and unrelated worlds of work, religious affiliation, and social activity, in each of which a reputation may be generated. <em>People v. Reeves</em>, 360 Ill. 55, 195 N.E. 443 (1935); <em>State v. Axilrod</em>, 248 Minn. 204, 79 N.W.2d 677 (1956); Mass.Stat. 1947, c. 410, M.G.L.A. c. 233 &sect;21A; 5 Wigmore &sect;1616. The family has often served as the point of beginning for allowing community reputation. 5 Wigmore &sect;1488. For comparable provisions see Uniform Rule 63(26), (27)(c); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1313, 1314; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(x), (y)(3); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(26), (27)(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first portion of Exception [paragraph] (20) is based upon the general admissibility of evidence of reputation as to land boundaries and land customs, expanded in this country to include private as well as public boundaries. McCormick &sect;299, p. 625. The reputation is required to antedate the controversy, though <!-- PDFPage:313 -->not to be ancient. The second portion is likewise supported by authority, <em>id</em>., and is designed to facilitate proof of events when judicial notice is not available The historical character of the subject matter dispenses with any need that the reputation antedate the controversy with respect to which it is offered. For similar provisions see Uniform Rule 63(27)(a), (b); California Evidence Code &sect;&sect;1320&ndash;1322; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(y), (1), (2); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(27)(a), (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception [paragraph] (21) recognizes the traditional acceptance of reputation evidence as a means of proving human character. McCormick &sect;&sect;44, 158. The exception deals only with the hearsay aspect of this kind of evidence. Limitations upon admissibility based on other grounds will be found in Rules 404, relevancy of character evidence generally, and 608, character of witness. The exception is in effect a reiteration, in the context of hearsay, of Rule 405(a). Similar provisions are contained in Uniform Rule 63(28); California Evidence Code &sect;1324; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(z); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(28).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (22). When the status of a former judgment is under consideration in subsequent litigation, three possibilities must be noted: (1) the former judgment is conclusive under the doctrine of res judicata, either as a bar or a collateral estoppel; or (2) it is admissible in evidence for what it is worth; or (3) it may be of no effect at all. The first situation does not involve any problem of evidence except in the way that principles of substantive law generally bear upon the relevancy and materiality of evidence. The rule does not deal with the substantive effect of the judgment as a bar or collateral estoppel. When, however, the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to make the judgment either a bar or a collateral estoppel, a choice is presented between the second and third alternatives. The rule adopts the second for judgments of criminal conviction of felony grade. This is the direction of the decisions, Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1299, which manifest an increasing reluctance to reject <em>in toto</em> the validity of the law's factfinding processes outside the confines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. While this may leave a jury with the evidence of conviction but without means to evaluate it, as suggested by Judge Hinton, Note 27 Ill.L.Rev. 195 (1932), it seems safe to assume that the jury will give it substantial effect unless defendant offers a satisfactory explanation, a possibility not foreclosed by the provision. But see <em>North River Ins. Co. v. Militello</em>, 104 Colo. 28, 88 P.2d 567 (1939), in which the jury found for plaintiff on a fire policy despite the introduction of his conviction for arson. For supporting federal decisions see Clark, J., in <em>New York & Cuba Mail S.S. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co</em>., 117 F.2d 404, 411 (2d Cir. 1941); <em>Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Farrara</em>, 277 F.2d 388 (8th Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">Practical considerations require exclusion of convictions of minor offenses, not became the administration of justice in its lower echelons must be inferior, but because motivation to defend at this level is often minimal or nonexistent. <em>Cope v. Goble</em>, 39 Cal.App.2d 448, 103 P.2d 598 (1940); <em>Jones v. Talbot</em>, 87 Idaho 498, 394 P.2d 316 (1964); <em>Warren v. Marsh</em>, 215 Minn. 615, 11 N.W.2d 528 (1943); Annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1295&ndash;1297; 16 Brooklyn L.Rev. 286 (1950); 50 Colum.L.Rev. 529 (1950); 35 Cornell L.Q. 872 (1950). Hence the rule includes only convictions of felony grade, measured by federal standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">Judgments of conviction based upon pleas of <em>nolo contendere</em> are not included. This position is consistent with the treatment of <em>nolo</em> pleas in Rule 410 and the authorities cited in the Advisory Committee's Note in support thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">While these rules do not in general purport to resolve constitutional issues, they have in general been drafted with a view to avoiding collision with constitutional principles. Consequently the exception does not include evidence of the conviction of a third person, offered against the accused in a criminal prosecution to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment of conviction. A contrary position would seem clearly to violate the right of confrontation. <em>Kirby v. United States</em>, 174 U.S. 47, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899), error to convict of possessing stolen postage stamps with the only evidence of theft being the record of conviction of the thieves The situation is to be distinguished from cases in which conviction of another person is an element of the crime, e.g. 15 U.S.C. &sect;902(d), interstate shipment of firearms to a known convicted felon, and, as specifically provided, from impeachment.</p>
<p class="note-body">For comparable provisions see Uniform Rule 63(20); California Evidence Code &sect;1300; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;460(r); New Jersey Evidence Rule 63(20).</p>
<p class="note-body">Exception (23). A hearsay exception in this area was originally justified on the ground that verdicts were evidence of reputation. As trial by jury graduated from the category of neighborhood inquests, this theory lost its validity. It was never valid as to chancery decrees. Nevertheless the rule persisted, though the judges and writers shifted ground and began saying that the judgment or decree was as good evidence as reputation. See <em>City of London v. Clerke</em>, Carth. 181, 90 Eng.Rep. 710 (K.B. 1691); <em>Neill v. Duke of Devonshire</em>, 8 App.Cas. 135 (1882). The shift appears to be correct, since the process of inquiry, sifting, and scrutiny which is relied upon to render reputation reliable is present in perhaps greater measure in the process of litigation. While this might suggest a broader area of application, the affinity to reputation is strong, and paragraph [paragraph] (23) goes no further, not even including character.</p>
<p class="note-body">The leading case in the <em>United States, Patterson v. Gaines</em>, 47 U.S. (6 How.) 550, 599, 12 L.Ed. 553 (1847), follows in the pattern of the English decisions, mentioning as illustrative matters thus provable: manorial rights, public rights of way, immemorial custom, disputed boundary, and pedigree. More recent recognition of the principle is found in <em>Grant Bros. Construction Co. v. United States</em>, 232 U.S. 647, 34 S.Ct. 452, 58 L.Ed. 776 (1914), in action for penalties under Alien Contract Labor Law, decision of board of inquiry of Immigration Service admissible to prove alienage of laborers, as a matter of pedigree; <em>United States v.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(3) was approved in the form submitted by the Court to Congress. However, the Committee intends that the Rule be construed to limit the doctrine of <em>Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon</em>, 145 U.S. 285, 295&ndash;300 (1892), so as to render statements of intent by a declarant admissible only to prove his future conduct, not the future conduct of another person.</p>
<p class="note-body">After giving particular attention to the question of physical examination made solely to enable a physician to testify, the Committee approved Rule 803(4) as submitted to Congress, with the understanding that it is not intended in any way to adversely affect present privilege rules or those subsequently adopted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(5) as submitted by the Court permitted the reading into evidence of a memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable him to testify accurately and fully, &ldquo;shown to have been made when the matter was fresh in his memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly.&rdquo; The Committee amended this Rule to add the words &ldquo;or adopted by the witness&rdquo; after the phrase &ldquo;shown to have been made&rdquo;, a treatment consistent with the definition of &ldquo;statement&rdquo; in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500. Moreover, it is the Committee's understanding that a memorandum or report, although barred under this Rule, would nonetheless be admissible if it came within another hearsay exception. This last stated principle is deemed applicable to all the hearsay rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(6) as submitted by the Court permitted a record made &ldquo;in the course of a regularly conducted ac<!-- PDFPage:314 -->tivity&rdquo; to be admissible in certain circumstances. The Committee believed there were insufficient guarantees of reliability in records made in the course of activities falling outside the scope of &ldquo;business&rdquo; activities as that term is broadly defined in 28 U.S.C. 1732. Moreover, the Committee concluded that the additional requirement of Section 1732 that it must have been the regular practice of a business to make the record is a necessary further assurance of its trustworthiness. The Committee accordingly amended the Rule to incorporate these limitations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(7) as submitted by the Court concerned the <em>absence</em> of entry in the records of a &ldquo;regularly conducted activity.&rdquo; The Committee amended this Rule to conform with its action with respect to Rule 803(6).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved Rule 803(8) without substantive change from the form in which it was submitted by the Court. The Committee intends that the phrase &ldquo;factual findings&rdquo; be strictly construed and that evaluations or opinions contained in public reports shall not be admissible under this Rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee approved this Rule in the form submitted by the Court, intending that the phrase &ldquo;Statements of fact concerning personal or family history&rdquo; be read to include the specific types of such statements enumerated in Rule 803(11).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">The House approved this rule as it was submitted by the Supreme Court &ldquo;with the understanding that it is not intended in any way to adversely affect present privilege rules.&rdquo; We also approve this rule, and we would point out with respect to the question of its relation to privileges, it must be read in conjunction with rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that whenever the physical or mental condition of a party (plaintiff or defendant) is in controversy, the court may require him to submit to an examination by a physician. It is these examinations which will normally be admitted under this exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(5) as submitted by the Court permitted the reading into evidence of a memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable him to testify accurately and fully, &ldquo;shown to have been made when the matter was fresh in his memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly.&rdquo; The House amended the rule to add the words &ldquo;or adopted by the witness&rdquo; after the phrase &ldquo;shown to have been made,&rdquo; language parallel to the Jencks Act [18 U.S.C. &sect;3500].</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee accepts the House amendment with the understanding and belief that it was not intended to narrow the scope of applicability of the rule. In fact, we understand it to clarify the rule's applicability to a memorandum adopted by the witness as well as one made by him. While the rule as submitted by the Court was silent on the question of who made the memorandum, we view the House amendment as a helpful clarification, noting, however, that the Advisory Committee's note to this rule suggests that the important thing is the accuracy of the memorandum rather than who made it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee does not view the House amendment as precluding admissibility in situations in which multiple participants were involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">When the verifying witness has not prepared the report, but merely examined it and found it accurate, he has adopted the report, and it is therefore admissible. The rule should also be interpreted to cover other situations involving multiple participants, e.g., employer dictating to secretary, secretary making memorandum at direction of employer, or information being passed along a chain of persons, as in <em>Curtis v. Bradley</em> [65 Conn. 99, 31 Atl. 591 (1894); see, also <em>Rathbun v. Brancatella</em>, 93 N.J.L. 222, 107 Atl. 279 (1919); see, also McCormick on Evidence, &sect;303 (2d ed. 1972)].</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee also accepts the understanding of the House that a memorandum or report, although barred under rule, would nonetheless be admissible if it came within another hearsay exception. We consider this principle to be applicable to all the hearsay rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803(6) as submitted by the Supreme Court permitted a record made in the course of a regularly conducted activity to be admissible in certain circumstances. This rule constituted a broadening of the traditional business records hearsay exception which has been long advocated by scholars and judges active in the law of evidence</p>
<p class="note-body">The House felt there were insufficient guarantees of reliability of records not within a broadly defined business records exception. We disagree. Even under the House definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; including profession, occupation, and &ldquo;calling of every kind,&rdquo; the records of many regularly conducted activities will, or may be, excluded from evidence. Under the principle of ejusdem generis, the intent of &ldquo;calling of every kind&rdquo; would seem to be related to work-related endeavors&mdash;e.g., butcher, baker, artist, etc.</p>
<p class="note-body">Thus, it appears that the records of many institutions or groups might not be admissible under the House amendments. For example, schools, churches, and hospitals will not normally be considered businesses within the definition. Yet, these are groups which keep financial and other records on a regular basis in a manner similar to business enterprises. We believe these records are of equivalent trustworthiness and should be admitted into evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Three states, which have recently codified their evidence rules, have adopted the Supreme Court version of rule 803(6), providing for admission of memoranda of a &ldquo;regularly conducted activity.&rdquo; None adopted the words &ldquo;business activity&rdquo; used in the House amendment. [See Nev. Rev. Stats. &sect;15.135; N. Mex. Stats. (1973 Supp.) &sect;20&ndash;4&ndash;803(6); West's Wis. Stats. Anno. (1973 Supp.) &sect;908.03(6).]</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, the committee deleted the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; as it appears before the word &ldquo;activity&rdquo;. The last sentence then is unnecessary and was also deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the understanding of the committee that the use of the phrase &ldquo;person with knowledge&rdquo; is not intended to imply that the party seeking to introduce the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation must be able to produce, or even identify, the specific individual upon whose first-hand knowledge the memorandum, report, record or data compilation was based. A sufficient foundation for the introduction of such evidence will be laid if the party seeking to introduce the evidence is able to show that it was the regular practice of the activity to base such memorandums, reports, records, or data compilations upon a transmission from a person with knowledge, e.g., in the case of the content of a shipment of goods, upon a report from the company's receiving agent or in the case of a computer printout, upon a report from the company's computer programer or one who has knowledge of the particular record system. In short, the scope of the phrase &ldquo;person with knowledge&rdquo; is meant to be coterminous with the custodian of the evidence or other qualified witness. The committee believes this represents the desired rule in light of the complex nature of modern business organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House approved rule 803(8), as submitted by the Supreme Court, with one substantive change. It excluded from the hearsay exception reports containing matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel in criminal cases. Ostensibly, the reason for this exclusion is that observations by police officers at the scene of the crime or the apprehension of the defendant are not as reliable as observations by public officials in other cases because of the adversarial nature of the confrontation between the police and the defendant in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee accepts the House's decision to exclude such recorded observations where the police officer is available to testify in court about his observation. However, where he is unavailable as unavailability is defined in rule 804(a)(4) and (a)(5), the report should be admitted as the best available evidence. Ac<!-- PDFPage:315 -->cordingly, the committee has amended rule 803(8) to refer to the provision of [proposed] rule 804(b)(5) [deleted], which allows the admission of such reports, records or other statements where the police officer or other law enforcement officer is unavailable because of death, then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity, or not being successfully subject to legal process.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House Judiciary Committee report contained a statement of intent that &ldquo;the phrase &lsquo;factual findings&rsquo; in subdivision (c) be strictly construed and that evaluations or opinions contained in public reports shall not be admissible under this rule.&rdquo; The committee takes strong exception to this limiting understanding of the application of the rule. We do not think it reflects an understanding of the intended operation of the rule as explained in the Advisory Committee notes to this subsection. The Advisory Committee notes on subsection (c) of this subdivision point out that various kinds of evaluative reports are now admissible under Federal statutes. 7 U.S.C. &sect;78, findings of Secretary of Agriculture prima facie evidence of true grade of grain; 42 U.S.C. &sect;269(b), bill of health by appropriate official prima facie evidence of vessel's sanitary history and condition and compliance with regulations. These statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule are preserved. Rule 802. The willingness of Congress to recognize these and other such evaluative reports provides a helpful guide in determining the kind of reports which are intended to be admissible under this rule. We think the restrictive interpretation of the House overlooks the fact that while the Advisory Committee assumes admissibility in the first instance of evaluative reports, they are not admissible if, as the rule states, &ldquo;the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee explains the factors to be considered:</p>
<p class="5800I92">* * * * *</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Factors which may be assistance in passing upon the admissibility of evaluative reports include: (1) the timeliness of the investigation, McCormick, Can the Courts Make Wider Use of Reports of Official Investigations? 42 Iowa L.Rev. 363 (1957); (2) the special skill or experience of the official, id.; (3) whether a hearing was held and the level at which conducted, <em>Franklin v. Skelly Oil Co</em>., 141 F.2d 568 (19th Cir. 1944); (4) possible motivation problems suggested by <em>Palmer v. Hoffman</em>, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). Others no doubt could be added.</p>
<p class="5800I92">* * * * *</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee concludes that the language of the rule together with the explanation provided by the Advisory Committee furnish sufficient guidance on the admissibility of evaluative reports.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed Rules of Evidence submitted to Congress contained identical provisions in rules 803 and 804 (which set forth the various hearsay exceptions), admitting any hearsay statement not specifically covered by any of the stated exceptions, if the hearsay statement was found to have &ldquo;comparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.&rdquo; The House deleted these provisions (proposed rules 803(24) and 804(b)(6)[(5)]) as injecting &ldquo;too much uncertainty&rdquo; into the law of evidence and impairing the ability of practitioners to prepare for trial. The House felt that rule 102, which directs the courts to construe the Rules of Evidence so as to promote growth and development, would permit sufficient flexibility to admit hearsay evidence in appropriate cases under various factual situations that might arise.</p>
<p class="note-body">We disagree with the total rejection of a residual hearsay exception. While we view rule 102 as being intended to provide for a broader construction and interpretation of these rules, we feel that, without a separate residual provision, the specifically enumerated exceptions could become tortured beyond any reasonable circumstances which they were intended to include (even if broadly construed). Moreover, these exceptions, while they reflect the most typical and well recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, may not encompass every situation in which the reliability and appropriateness of a particular piece of hearsay evidence make clear that it should be heard and considered by the trier of fact.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee believes that there are certain exceptional circumstances where evidence which is found by a court to have guarantees of trust worthiness equivalent to or exceeding the guarantees reflected by the presently listed exceptions, and to have a high degree of prolativeness and necessity could properly be admissible.</p>
<p class="note-body">The case of <em>Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assoc. Co., Ltd</em>., 286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1961) illustrates the point. The issue in that case was whether the tower of the county courthouse collapsed because it was struck by lightning (covered by insurance) or because of structural weakness and deterioration of the structure (not covered). Investigation of the structure revealed the presence of charcoal and charred timbers. In order to show that lightning may not have been the cause of the charring, the insurer offered a copy of a local newspaper published over 50 years earlier containing an unsigned article describing a fire in the courthouse while it was under construction. The Court found that the newspaper did not qualify for admission as a business record or an ancient document and did not fit within any other recognized hearsay exception. The court concluded, however, that the article was trustworthy because it was inconceivable that a newspaper reporter in a small town would report a fire in the courthouse if none had occurred. <em>See also United States v. Barbati</em>, 284 F. Supp. 409 (E.D.N.Y. 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because exceptional cases like the <em>Dallas County</em> case may arise in the future, the committee has decided to reinstate a residual exception for rules 803 and 804(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee, however, also agrees with those supporters of the House version who felt that an overly broad residual hearsay exception could emasculate the hearsay rule and the recognized exceptions or vitiate the rationale behind codification of the rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, the committee has adopted a residual exception for rules 803 and 804(b) of much narrower scope and applicability than the Supreme Court version. In order to qualify for admission, a hearsay statement not falling within one of the recognized exceptions would have to satisfy at least four conditions. First, it must have &ldquo;equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.&rdquo; Second, it must be offered as evidence of a material fact. Third, the court must determine that the statement &ldquo;is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts.&rdquo; This requirement is intended to insure that only statements which have high probative value and necessity may qualify for admission under the residual exceptions. Fourth, the court must determine that &ldquo;the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It is intended that the residual hearsay exceptions will be used very rarely, an only in exceptional circumstances. The committee does not intend to establish a broad license for trial judges to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions contained in rules 803 and 804(b). The residual exceptions are not meant to authorize major judicial revisions of the hearsay rule, including its present exceptions. Such major revisions are best accomplished by legislative action. It is intended that in any case in which evidence is sought to be admitted under these subsections, the trial judge will exercise no less care, reflection and caution than the courts did under the common law in establishing the now-recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to establish a well-defined jurisprudence, the special facts and circumstances which, in the court's <!-- PDFPage:316 -->judgment, indicates that the statement has a sufficiently high degree of trustworthiness and necessity to justify its admission should be stated on the record. It is expected that the court will give the opposing party a full and adequate opportunity to contest the admission of any statement sought to be introduced under these subsections.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No.&nbsp;93&ndash;1597</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 803 defines when hearsay statements are admissible in evidence even though the declarant is available as a witness. The Senate amendments make three changes in this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill provides in subsection (6) that records of a regularly conducted &ldquo;business&rdquo; activity qualify for admission into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. &ldquo;Business&rdquo; is defined as including &ldquo;business, profession, occupation and calling of every kind.&rdquo; The Senate amendment drops the requirement that the records be those of a &ldquo;business&rdquo; activity and eliminates the definition of &ldquo;business.&rdquo; The Senate amendment provides that records are admissible if they are records of a regularly conducted &ldquo;activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the House provision that the records must be those of a regularly conducted &ldquo;business&rdquo; activity. The Conferees changed the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; contained in the House provision in order to make it clear that the records of institutions and associations like schools, churches and hospitals are admissible under this provision. The records of public schools and hospitals are also covered by Rule 803(8), which deals with public records and reports.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment adds language, not contained in the House bill, that refers to another rule that was added by the Senate in another amendment ([proposed] Rule 804(b)(5)&mdash;Criminal law enforcement records and reports [deleted]).</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of its action on [proposed] Rule 804(b)(5) (Criminal law enforcement records and reports) [deleted], the Conference does not adopt the Senate amendment and restores the bill to the House version.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Senate amendment adds a new subsection, (24), which makes admissible a hearsay statement not specifically covered by any of the previous twenty-three subsections, if the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness and if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House bill eliminated a similar, but broader, provision because of the conviction that such a provision injected too much uncertainty into the law of evidence regarding hearsay and impaired the ability of a litigant to prepare adequately for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate amendment with an amendment that provides that a party intending to request the court to use a statement under this provision must notify any adverse party of this intention as well as of the particulars of the statement, including the name and address of the declarant. This notice must be given sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide any adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to contest the use of the statement.</p>
