<h3 class="section-head">Rule 46. Dismissing Cases</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. At any stage of the proceedings, whenever all parties file with the Clerk an agreement in writing that a case be dismissed, specifying the terms for payment of costs, and pay to the Clerk <!-- PDFPage:399 -->any fees then due, the Clerk, without further reference to the Court, will enter an order of dismissal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. (a) A petitioner or appellant may file a motion to dismiss the case, with proof of service as required by Rule 29, tendering to the Clerk any fees due and costs payable. No more than 15 days after service thereof, an adverse party may file an objection, limited to the amount of damages and costs in this Court alleged to be payable or to showing that the moving party does not represent all petitioners or appellants. The Clerk will not file any objection not so limited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the objection asserts that the moving party does not represent all the petitioners or appellants, the party moving for dismissal may file a reply within 10 days, after which time the matter will be submitted to the Court for its determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If no objection is filed&mdash;or if upon objection going only to the amount of damages and costs in this Court, the party moving for dismissal tenders the additional damages and costs in full within 10 days of the demand therefor&mdash;the Clerk, without further reference to the Court, will enter an order of dismissal. If, after objection as to the amount of damages and costs in this Court, the moving party does not respond by a tender within 10 days, the Clerk will report the matter to the Court for its determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. No mandate or other process will issue on a dismissal under this Rule without an order of the Court.</p>
