<h3 class="section-head">Rule 33. Appeal Conferences</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The court may direct the attorneys&mdash;and, when appropriate, the parties&mdash;to participate in one or more conferences to address any matter that may aid in disposing of the proceedings, including simplifying the issues and discussing settlement. A judge or other person designated by the court may preside over the conference, which may be conducted in person or by telephone. Before a settlement conference, the attorneys must consult with their clients and obtain as much authority as feasible to settle the case. The court may, as a result of the conference, enter an order controlling the course of the proceedings or implementing any settlement agreement.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">The uniform rule for review or enforcement of orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions or officers (see the general note following Rule 15) authorizes a prehearing conference in agency review proceedings. The same considerations which make a prehearing conference desirable in such proceedings may be present in certain cases on appeal from the district courts. The proposed rule is based upon subdivision 11 of the present uniform rule for review of agency orders.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 33 has been entirely rewritten. The new rule makes several changes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The caption of the rule has been changed from &ldquo;Prehearing Conference&rdquo; to &ldquo;Appeal Conferences&rdquo; to reflect the fact that occasionally a conference is held after oral argument.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule permits the court to require the parties to attend the conference in appropriate cases. The Com<!-- PDFPage:65 -->mittee does not contemplate that attendance of the parties will become routine, but in certain instances the parties&rsquo; presence can be useful. The language of the rule is broad enough to allow a court to determine that an executive or employee (other than the general counsel) of a corporation or government agency with authority regarding the matter at issue, constitutes &ldquo;the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule includes the possibility of settlement among the possible conference topics.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule recognizes that conferences are often held by telephone.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule allows a judge or other person designated by the court to preside over a conference. A number of local rules permit persons other than judges to preside over conferences. 1st Cir. R. 47.5; 6th Cir. R. 18; 8th Cir. R. 33A; 9th Cir. R. 33&ndash;1; and 10th Cir. R. 33.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule requires an attorney to consult with his or her client before a settlement conference and obtain as much authority as feasible to settle the case. An attorney can never settle a case without his or her client's consent. Certain entities, especially government entities, have particular difficulty obtaining authority to settle a case. The rule requires counsel to obtain only as much authority &ldquo;as feasible.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of the rule is amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
