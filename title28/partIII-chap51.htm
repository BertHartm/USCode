<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;244, 248, 283a and 289 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;&sect;139, 143, 183, 36 Stat. 1136, 1142; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, &sect;&sect;301, 302, 310, 42 Stat. 23, 25, Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212, title II, &sect;19, 47 Stat. 1519; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, &sect;512(b), 48 Stat. 759).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates a part of sections 244 and 248 with sections 283a and 289, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions in section 248 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for distribution by the clerk of copies of the court's decisions is incorporated in section 415 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Certain provisions of section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the bailiff and the chief messenger of the Court of Claims, and powers and duties of the clerk, his deputies and assistants, are incorporated in sections 795 and 956 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A provision in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the oath of the clerk of such court was omitted as covered by section 951 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Word &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;chief clerk&rdquo; to harmonize with such designation of clerks of all other courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision that such officers shall be under the direction of the court in the performance of their duties was omitted as superfluous.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk and assistant shall be subject to removal by the Court was substituted for the grounds of misconduct or incapacity. This change is in harmony with like provisions as to the clerks of other courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 289 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to duplicate the reporting to Congress of judgments which are furnished by the clerk. The revised section eliminates such duplication by requiring the clerk to transmit the information to Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;Attorney General,&rdquo; in view of the act of August 7, 1939, ch. 501, &sect;6, 53 Stat. 1226, 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed., following &sect;446.</p>
<p class="note-body">As revised, this section is consistent with similar provisions as to clerks of district courts and the courts of appeals in chapters 47 and 49 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in phraseology were made.</p>
