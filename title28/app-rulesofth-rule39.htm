<h3 class="section-head">Rule 39. Proceedings <em>In Forma Pauperis</em></h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">1. A party seeking to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> shall file a motion for leave to do so, together with the party's notarized affidavit or declaration (in compliance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746) in the form prescribed by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Form 4. The motion shall state whether leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> was sought in any other court and, if so, whether leave was granted. If the United States district court or the United States court of appeals has appointed counsel under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A, or under any other applicable federal statute, no affidavit or declaration is required, but the motion shall cite the statute under which counsel was appointed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">2. If leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> is sought for the purpose of filing a document, the motion, and an affidavit or declaration if required, shall be filed together with that document and shall comply in every respect with Rule 21. As provided in that Rule, it suffices to file an original and 10 copies, unless the party is an inmate confined in an institution and is not represented by counsel, in which case the original, alone, suffices. A copy of the motion shall precede and be attached to each copy of the accompanying document.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">3. Except when these Rules expressly provide that a document shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.1, every document presented by a party proceeding under this Rule shall be prepared as required by Rule 33.2 (unless such preparation is impossible). Every document shall be legible. While making due allowance for any case presented under this Rule by a person appearing <em>pro se</em>, the Clerk will not file any document if it does not comply with the substance of these Rules or is jurisdictionally out of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">4. When the documents required by paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Rule are presented to the Clerk, accompanied by proof of service as required by Rule 29, they will be placed on the docket without the payment of a docket fee or any other fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">5. The respondent or appellee in a case filed <em>in forma pauperis</em> shall respond in the same manner and within the same time as in any other case of the same nature, except that the filing of an original and 10 copies of a response prepared as required by Rule 33.2, with proof of service as required by Rule 29, suffices. The respondent or appellee may challenge the grounds for the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> in a separate document or in the response itself.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">6. Whenever the Court appoints counsel for an indigent party in a case set for oral argument, the briefs on the merits submitted by that counsel, unless otherwise requested, shall be prepared under the Clerk's supervision. The Clerk also will reimburse appointed counsel for any necessary travel expenses to Washington, D.C., and return in connection with the argument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">7. In a case in which certiorari has been granted, probable jurisdiction noted, or consideration of jurisdiction postponed, this Court may appoint counsel to represent a party financially unable to afford an attorney to the extent authorized by the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A, or by any other applicable federal statute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">8. If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>
