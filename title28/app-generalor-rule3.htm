<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">In the interest of achieving greater uniformity with the corresponding federal rule, a number of changes have been made to RCFC 3. First, subdivision (a) was fully conformed to the federal rule; the reference to RCFC 40.2 calls attention to this court's &ldquo;related case&rdquo; rule. Second, former subdivision (b), which addressed disputes regarding filing dates, was deleted&mdash;both in the interest of uniformity and in the belief that it was inappropriate to include a rule of decision as part of a procedural rule. Third, former subdivision (c) (prescribing a cover sheet and identifying the number of copies required for filing), was moved to RCFC 5.3(d).</p>
