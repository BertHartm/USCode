<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Civil Docket</cap-smallcap>. The clerk shall keep a book known as &ldquo;civil docket&rdquo; of such form and style as may be prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States, and shall enter therein each civil action to which these rules are made applicable. Actions shall be assigned consecutive file numbers. The file number of each action shall be noted on the folio of the docket whereon the first entry of the action is made. All papers filed with the clerk, all process issued and returns made thereon, all appearances, orders, verdicts, and judgments shall be entered chronologically in the civil docket on the folio assigned to the action and shall be marked with its file number. These entries shall be brief but shall show the nature of each paper filed or writ issued and the substance of each order or judgment of the court and of the returns showing execution of process. The entry of an order or judgment shall show the date the entry is made. When in an action trial by jury has been properly demanded or ordered the clerk shall enter the word &ldquo;jury&rdquo; on the folio assigned to that action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Civil Judgments and Orders</cap-smallcap>. The clerk shall keep, in such form and manner as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the United States may prescribe, a correct copy of every final judgment or appealable order, or order affecting title to or lien upon real or personal property, and any other order which the court may direct to be kept.</p>

Suitable indices of the civil docket and of every civil judgment and order referred to in subdivision (b) of this rule shall be kept by the clerk under the direction of the court.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, acting subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, in the place of the Attorney General as a consequence of and in accordance with the provisions of the act establishing the Administrative Office and transferring functions thereto. Act of August 7, 1939, c. 501, &sect;&sect;1&ndash;7, 53 Stat. 1223, 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;444&ndash;450 [now 601&ndash;610].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The change in this subdivision does not alter the nature of the judgments and orders to be recorded in permanent form but it does away with the express requirement that they be recorded in a book. This merely gives latitude for the preservation of court records in other than book form, if that shall seem advisable, and permits with the approval of the Judicial <!-- PDFPage:267 -->Conference the adoption of such modern, space-saving methods as microphotography. See <em>Proposed Improvements in the Administration of the Offices of Clerks of United States District Courts</em>, prepared by the Bureau of the Budget (1941) 38&ndash;42. See also Rule 55, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [following section 687 of Title 18 U.S.C.].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The words &ldquo;Separate and&rdquo; have been deleted as unduly rigid. There is no sufficient reason for requiring that the indices in all cases be separate; on the contrary, the requirement frequently increases the labor of persons searching the records as well as the labor of the clerk's force preparing them. The matter should be left to administrative discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other changes in the subdivision merely conform with those made in subdivision (b) of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Subdivision (d) is a new provision enabling the Administrative Office, with the approval of the Judicial Conference, to carry out any improvements in clerical procedure with respect to books and records which may be deemed advisable. See report cited in Note to subdivision (b), <em>supra.</em></p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change in nomenclature conforms to the official designation in Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;231.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The terminology is clarified without any change of the prescribed practice. See amended Rule 58, and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto.</p>
