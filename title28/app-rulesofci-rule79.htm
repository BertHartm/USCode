<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, acting subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, in the place of the Attorney General as a consequence of and in accordance with the provisions of the act establishing the Administrative Office and transferring functions thereto. Act of August 7, 1939, c. 501, &sect;&sect;1&ndash;7, 53 Stat. 1223, 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;444&ndash;450 [now 601&ndash;610].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The change in this subdivision does not alter the nature of the judgments and orders to be recorded in permanent form but it does away with the express requirement that they be recorded in a book. This merely gives latitude for the preservation of court records in other than book form, if that shall seem advisable, and permits with the approval of the Judicial Conference the adoption of such modern, space-saving methods as microphotography. See <em>Proposed Improvements in the Administration of the Offices of Clerks of United States District Courts</em>, prepared by the Bureau of the Budget (1941) 38&ndash;42. See also Rule 55, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [following section 687 of Title 18 U.S.C.].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The words &ldquo;Separate and&rdquo; have been deleted as unduly rigid. There is no sufficient reason for requiring that the indices in all cases be separate; on the contrary, the requirement frequently increases the labor of persons searching the records as well as the labor of the clerk's force preparing them. The matter should be left to administrative discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other changes in the subdivision merely conform with those made in subdivision (b) of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Subdivision (d) is a new provision enabling the Administrative Office, with the approval of the Judicial Conference, to carry out any improvements in clerical procedure with respect to books and records which may be deemed advisable. See report cited in Note to subdivision (b), <em>supra.</em></p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change in nomenclature conforms to the official designation in Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;231.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The terminology is clarified without any change of the prescribed practice. See amended Rule 58, and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 79 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
