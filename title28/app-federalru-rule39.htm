<h4 class="note-head">Notes on Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Statutory authorization for taxation of costs is found in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1920. The provisions of this subdivision follow the usual practice in the circuits. A few statutes contain specific provisions in derogation of these general provisions. (See 28 U.S.C. &sect;1928, which forbids the award of costs to a successful plaintiff in a patent infringement action under the circumstances described by the statute). These statutes are controlling in cases to which they apply.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The rules of the courts of appeals at present commonly deny costs to the United States except as allowance may be directed by statute. Those rules were promulgated at a time when the United States was generally invulnerable to an award of costs against it, and they appear to be based on the view that if the United States is not subject to costs if it loses, it ought not be entitled to recover costs if it wins.</p>
<p class="note-body">The number of cases affected by such rules has been greatly reduced by the Act of July 18, 1966, 80 Stat. 308 (1 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, p. 349 (1966), 89th Cong., 2d Sess., which amended 28 U.S.C. &sect;2412, the former general bar to the award of costs against the United States. Section 2412 as amended generally places the United States on the same footing as private parties with respect to the award of costs in civil cases. But the United States continues to enjoy immunity from costs in certain cases. By its terms amended section 2412 authorizes an award of costs against the United States only in civil actions, and it excepts from its general authorization of an award of costs against the United States cases which are &ldquo;otherwise specifically provided (for) by statute.&rdquo; Furthermore, the Act of July 18, 1966, <em>supra</em>, provides that the amendments of section 2412 which it effects shall apply only to actions filed subsequent to the date of its enactment. The second clause continues in effect, for these and all other cases in which the United States enjoys immunity from costs, the presently prevailing rule that the United States may recover costs as the prevailing party only if it would have suffered them as the losing party.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. While only five circuits (D.C. Cir. Rule 20(d); 1st Cir. Rule 31(4); 3d Cir. Rule 35(4); 4th Cir. Rule 21(4); 9th Cir. Rule 25, as amended June 2, 1967) presently tax the cost of printing briefs, the proposed rule makes the cost taxable in keeping with the principle of this rule that all cost items expended in the prosecution of a proceeding should be borne by the unsuccessful party.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The costs described in this subdivision are costs of the appeal and, as such, are within the undertaking of the appeal bond. They are made taxable in the district court for general convenience. Taxation of the cost of the reporter's transcript is specifically authorized by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1920, but in the absence of a rule some district courts have held themselves without authority to tax the cost (<em>Perlman v. Feldmann</em>, 116 F.Supp. 102 (D.Conn., 1953); <em>Firtag v. Gendleman</em>, 152 F.Supp. 226 (D.D.C., 1957); <em>Todd Atlantic Shipyards Corps. v. The Southport</em>, 100 F.Supp. 763 (E.D.S.C., 1951). Provision for taxation of the cost of premiums paid for supersedeas bonds is common in the local rules of district courts and the practice is established in the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. <em>Berner v. British Commonwealth Pacific Air Lines, Ltd</em>., 362 F.2d 799 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>Land Oberoesterreich v. Gude</em>, 93 F.2d 292 (2d Cir., 1937); <em>In re Northern Ind. Oil Co</em>., 192 F.2d 139 (7th Cir., 1951); <em>Lunn v. F. W. Woolworth</em>, 210 F.2d 159 (9th Cir., 1954).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The proposed amendment would permit variations among the circuits in regulating the maximum rates taxable as costs for printing or otherwise reproducing briefs, appendices, and copies of records authorized by Rule 30(f). The present rule has had a different effect in different circuits depending upon the size of the circuit, the location of the clerk's office, and the location of other cities. As a consequence there was a growing sense that strict adherence to the rule produces some unfairness in some of the circuits and the matter should be made subject to local rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The present rule makes no provision for objections to a bill of costs. The proposed amendment would allow 10 days for such objections. Cf. Rule 54(d) of the F.R.C.P. It provides further that the mandate shall not be delayed for taxation of costs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:64 --><h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1986 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (c) is intended to increase the degree of control exercised by the courts of appeals over rates for printing and copying recoverable as costs. It further requires the courts of appeals to encourage cost-consciousness by requiring that, in fixing the rate, the court consider the most economical methods of printing and copying.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (d) is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. All references to the cost of &ldquo;printing&rdquo; have been deleted from subdivision (c) because commercial printing is so rarely used for preparation of documents filed with a court of appeals.</p>
