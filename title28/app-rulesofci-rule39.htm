<h3 class="section-head">Rule 39. Trial by Jury or by the Court</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>By Jury</cap-smallcap>. When trial by jury has been demanded as provided in Rule 38, the action shall be designated upon the docket as a jury action. The trial of all issues so demanded shall be by jury, unless (1) the parties or their attorneys of record, by written stipulation filed with the court or by an oral stipulation made in open court and entered in the record, consent to trial by the court sitting without a jury or (2) the court upon motion or of its own initiative finds that a right of trial by jury of some or all of those issues does not exist under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>By the Court</cap-smallcap>. Issues not demanded for trial by jury as provided in Rule 38 shall be tried by the court; but, notwithstanding the failure of a party to demand a jury in an action in which such a demand might have been made of right, the court in its discretion upon motion may order a trial by a jury of any or all issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advisory Jury and Trial by Consent</cap-smallcap>. In all actions not triable of right by a jury the court upon motion or of its own initiative may try any issue with an advisory jury or, except in actions against the United States when a statute of the United States provides for trial without a jury, the court, with the consent of both parties, may order a trial with a jury whose verdict has the same effect as if trial by jury had been a matter of right.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">The provisions for express waiver of jury trial found in U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;773 (Trial of issues of fact; by court) are incorporated in this rule. See rule 38, however, which extends the provisions for waiver of jury. U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;772 (Trial of issues of fact; in equity in patent causes) is unaffected by this rule. When certain of the issues are to be tried by jury <!-- PDFPage:204 -->and others by the court, the court may determine the sequence in which such issues shall be tried. See <em>Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat. Bank</em>, 260 U.S. 235 (1922).</p>
<p class="note-body">A discretionary power in the courts to send issues of fact to the jury is common in state procedure. Compare Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;592; 1 Colo.Stat.Ann. (1935) Code Civ.Proc., ch. 12, &sect;191; Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930) &sect;5625; 2 Minn.Stat. (Mason, 1927) &sect;9288; 4 Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. (1935) &sect;9327; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;430; 2 Ohio Gen.Code Ann. (Page, 1926) &sect;11380; 1 Okla.Stat.Ann. (Harlow, 1931) &sect;351; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933) &sect;104&ndash;23&ndash;5; 2 Wash.Rev.Stat.Ann. (Remington, 1932) &sect;315; Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;270.07. See [former] Equity Rule 23 (Matters Ordinarily Determinable at Law When Arising in Suit in Equity to be Disposed of Therein) and U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;772 (Trial of issues of fact; in equity in patent causes); <em>Colleton Merc. Mfg. Co. v. Savannah River Lumber Co</em>., 280 Fed. 358 (C.C.A.4th, 1922); <em>Fed. Res. Bk. of San Francisco v. Idaho Grimm Alfalfa Seed Growers&rsquo; Ass'n</em>, 8 F.(2d) 922 (C.C.A.9th, 1925), cert. den. 270 U.S. 646 (1926); <em>Watt v. Starke</em>, 101 U.S. 247, 25 L.Ed. 826 (1879).</p>
