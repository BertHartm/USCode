<h3 class="section-head">Rule 615. Exclusion of Witnesses</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person, or (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party's cause, or (4) a person authorized by statute to be present.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">The efficacy of excluding or sequestering witnesses has long been recognized as a means of discouraging and exposing fabrication, inaccuracy, and collusion. 6 Wigmore &sect;&sect;1837&ndash;1838. The authority of the judge is admitted, the only question being whether the matter is committed to his discretion or one of right. The rule takes the latter position. No time is specified for making the request.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several categories of persons are excepted. (1) Exclusion of persons who are parties would raise serious problems of confrontation and due process. Under accepted practice they are not subject to exclusion. 6 Wigmore &sect;1841. (2) As the equivalent of the right of a natural-person party to be present, a party which is not a natural person is entitled to have a representative present. Most of the cases have involved allowing a police officer who has been in charge of an investigation to remain in court despite the fact that he will be a witness. <em>United States v. Infanzon</em>, 235 F.2d 318 (2d Cir. 1956); <em>Portomene v. United States</em>, 221 F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1955); <em>Powell v. United States</em>, 208 F.2d 618 (6th Cir. 1953); <em>Jones v. United States</em>, 252 F.Supp. 781 (W.D.Okl. 1966). Designation of the representative by the attorney rather than by the client may at first glance appear to be an inversion of the attorney-client relationship, but it may be assumed that the attorney will follow the wishes of the client, and the solution is simple and workable. See California Evidence Code &sect;777. (3) The category contemplates such persons as an agent who handled the transaction being litigated or an expert needed to advise counsel in the management of the litigation. See 6 Wigmore &sect;1841, n. 4.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93&ndash;1277</h4>
<p class="note-body">Many district courts permit government counsel to have an investigative agent at counsel table through<!-- PDFPage:327 -->out the trial although the agent is or may be a witness. The practice is permitted as an exception to the rule of exclusion and compares with the situation defense counsel finds himself in&mdash;he always has the client with him to consult during the trial. The investigative agent's presence may be extremely important to government counsel, especially when the case is complex or involves some specialized subject matter. The agent, too, having lived with the case for a long time, may be able to assist in meeting trial surprises where the best-prepared counsel would otherwise have difficulty. Yet, it would not seem the Government could often meet the burden under rule 615 of showing that the agent's presence is essential. Furthermore, it could be dangerous to use the agent as a witness as early in the case as possible, so that he might then help counsel as a nonwitness, since the agent's testimony could be needed in rebuttal. Using another, nonwitness agent from the same investigative agency would not generally meet government counsel's needs.</p>
<p class="note-body">This problem is solved if it is clear that investigative agents are within the group specified under the second exception made in the rule, for &ldquo;an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney.&rdquo; It is our understanding that this was the intention of the House committee. It is certainly this committee's construction of the rule.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is in response to: (1) the Victim's Rights and Restitution Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. &sect;10606, which guarantees, within certain limits, the right of a crime victim to attend the trial; and (2) the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997 (18 U.S.C. &sect;3510).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body">1988&mdash;Pub. L. 100&ndash;690, which directed amendment of rule by inserting &ldquo;a&rdquo; before &ldquo;party which is not a natural person.&rdquo;, could not be executed because the words &ldquo;party which is not a natural person.&rdquo; did not appear. However, the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; was inserted by the intervening amendment by the Court by order dated Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov. 1, 1988.</p>
