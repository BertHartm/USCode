<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Standards.</strong> RCFC 56(a)&ndash;(b) applies, with the exception that any supplementation of the administrative record shall be by stipulation or by court order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedures.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> The moving or cross-moving party shall file, together with its motion, a separate document titled Statement of Facts setting forth the facts necessary to resolve the issues presented on review. This document shall contain concise, separately numbered paragraphs setting forth all of the facts upon which the party bases its motion and which are supported by the record. Each paragraph shall contain citations to the opposing party's pleadings or to documentary evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The opposing party shall file, together with its opposition or cross-motion, a separate document titled Counter-Statement of Facts. This document shall indicate immediately below each statement of fact whether it agrees or disagrees with the fact as stated. The party shall state the precise nature of its disagreement and give its version of the events supported by record citations. The opposing party may also file Proposed Additional Facts as to any relevant matters not covered by the moving party's statement to which the movant shall respond in like format.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 56.1 has no FRCP counterpart. In the interests of procedural clarity, the text of subdivision (a) was modified to reflect current practice with respect to supplementation of the administrative record and subdivision (b)(2) was modified to make explicit an opposing party's right to file an opposition as well as a cross-motion. In addition, the rule was conformed to RCFC 56 practice, in that the statement of facts and counterstatement of facts are presented in a single document. In other respects, RCFC 56.1 remains unchanged.</p>
