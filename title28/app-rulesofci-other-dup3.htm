<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Real Party in Interest</cap-smallcap>. Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, or a party authorized by statute may sue in that person's own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought; and when a statute of the United States so provides, an action for the use or benefit of another shall be brought in the name of the United States. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest; and such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Capacity To Sue or Be Sued</cap-smallcap>. The capacity of an individual, other than one acting in a representative capacity, to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the individual's domicile. The capacity of a corporation to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law under which it was organized. In all other cases capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the state in which the district court is held, except (1) that a partnership or other unincorporated association, which has no such capacity by the law of such state, may sue or be sued in its common name for the purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States, and (2) that the capacity of a receiver appointed by a court of the United States to sue or be sued in a court of the United States is governed by Title 28, U.S.C., Sections 754 and 959(a).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:127 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Infants or Incompetent Persons</cap-smallcap>. Whenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on behalf of the infant or incompetent person. An infant or incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for an infant or incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the infant or incompetent person.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. The real party in interest provision, except for the last clause which is new, is taken verbatim from [former] Equity Rule 37 (Parties Generally&mdash;Intervention), except that the word &ldquo;expressly&rdquo; has been omitted. For similar provisions see N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;210; Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann. (1931) &sect;&sect;89&ndash;501, 89&ndash;502, 89&ndash;503; <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r. 8. See also Equity Rule 41 (Suit to Execute Trusts of Will&mdash;Heir as Party). For examples of statutes of the United States providing particularly for an action for the use or benefit of another in the name of the United States, see U.S.C., [former] Title 40, &sect;270b (Suit by persons furnishing labor and material for work on public building contracts *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may sue on a payment bond, &ldquo;in the name of the United States for the use of the person suing&rdquo;) [now 40 U.S.C. &sect;3133(b), (c)]; and U.S.C., Title 25, &sect;201 (Penalties under laws relating to Indians&mdash;how recovered). Compare U.S.C., Title 26, [former] &sect;1645(c) (Suits for penalties, fines, and forfeitures, under this title, where not otherwise provided for, to be in name of United States).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. For capacity see generally Clark and Moore, <em>A New Federal Civil Procedure&mdash;II. Pleadings and Parties</em>, 44 Yale L.J. 1291, 1312&ndash;1317 (1935) and specifically <em>Coppedge v. Clinton</em>, 72 F.(2d) 531 (C.C.A.10th, 1934) (natural person); <em>David Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club of America</em>, 225 U.S. 489 (1912) (corporation); <em>Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co</em>., 288 U.S. 476 (1933) (unincorporated ass'n.); <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co</em>., 259 U.S. 344 (1922) (federal substantive right enforced against unincorporated association by suit against the association in its common name without naming all its members as parties). This rule follows the existing law as to such associations, as declared in the case last cited above. Compare <em>Moffat Tunnel League v. United States</em>, 289 U.S. 113 (1933). See note to Rule 23, clause (1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (c)</em>. The provision for infants and incompetent persons is substantially [former] Equity Rule 70 (Suits by or Against Incompetents) with slight additions. Compare the more detailed English provisions, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r.r. 16&ndash;21.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The new matter [in subdivision (b)] makes clear the controlling character of Rule 66 regarding suits by or against a federal receiver in a federal court.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Since the statute states the capacity of a federal receiver to sue or be sued, a repetitive statement in the rule is confusing and undesirable.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The minor change in the text of the rule is designed to make it clear that the specific instances enumerated are not exceptions to, but illustrations of, the rule. These illustrations, of course, carry no negative implication to the effect that there are not other instances of recognition as the real party in interest of one whose standing as such may be in doubt. The enumeration is simply of cases in which there might be substantial doubt as to the issue but for the specific enumeration. There are other potentially arguable cases that are not excluded by the enumeration. For example, the enumeration states that the promisee in a contract for the benefit of a third party may sue as real party in interest; it does not say, because it is obvious, that the third-party beneficiary may sue (when the applicable law gives him that right.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule adds to the illustrative list of real parties in interest a bailee&mdash;meaning, of course, a bailee suing on behalf of the bailor with respect to the property bailed. (When the possessor of property other than the owner sues for an invasion of the possessory interest he is the real party in interest.) The word &ldquo;bailee&rdquo; is added primarily to preserve the admiralty practice whereby the owner of a vessel as bailee of the cargo, or the master of the vessel as bailee of both vessel and cargo, sues for damage to either property interest or both. But there is no reason to limit such a provision to maritime situations. The owner of a warehouse in which household furniture is stored is equally entitled to sue on behalf of the numerous owners of the furniture stored. Cf. <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert</em>, 330 U.S. 501 (1947).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision that no action shall be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed, after the objection has been raised, for ratification, substitution, etc., is added simply in the interests of justice. In its origin the rule concerning the real party in interest was permissive in purpose: it was designed to allow an assignee to sue in his own name. That having been accomplished, the modern function of the rule in its negative aspect is simply to protect the defendant against a subsequent action by the party actually entitled to recover, and to insure generally that the judgment will have its proper effect as res judicata.</p>
<p class="note-body">This provision keeps pace with the law as it is actually developing. Modern decisions are inclined to be lenient when an honest mistake has been made in choosing the party in whose name the action is to be filed&mdash;in both maritime and nonmaritime cases. See <em>Levinson v. Deupree</em>, 345 U.S. 648 (1953); <em>Link Aviation, Inc. v. Downs</em>, 325 F.2d 613 (D.C.Cir. 1963). The provision should not be misunderstood or distorted. It is intended to prevent forfeiture when determination of the proper party to sue is difficult or when an understandable mistake has been made. It does not mean, for example, that, following an airplane crash in which all aboard were killed, an action may be filed in the name of John Doe (a fictitious person), as personal representative of Richard Roe (another fictitious person), in the hope that at a later time the attorney filing the action may substitute the real name of the real personal representative of a real victim, and have the benefit of suspension of the limitation period. It does not even mean, when an action is filed by the personal representative of John Smith, of Buffalo, in the good faith belief that he was aboard the flight, that upon discovery that Smith is alive and well, having missed the fatal flight, the representative of James Brown, of San Francisco, an actual victim, can be substituted to take advantage of the suspension of the limitation period. It is, in cases of this sort, intended to insure against forfeiture and injustice&mdash;in short, to codify in broad terms the salutary principle of <em>Levinson v. Deupree</em>, 345 U.S. 648 (1953), and <em>Link Aviation, Inc. v. Downs</em>, 325 F.2d 613 (D.C.Cir. 1963).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Joinder of Claims</cap-smallcap>. A party asserting a claim to relief as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, may join, either as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims, legal, equitable, or maritime, as the party has against an opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Joinder of Remedies; Fraudulent Conveyances</cap-smallcap>. Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to have set aside a conveyance fraudulent as to that plaintiff, without first having obtained a judgment establishing the claim for money.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. 1. Recent development, both in code and common law states, has been toward unlimited joinder of actions. See Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937) ch. 110, &sect;168; N.J.S.A. 2:27&ndash;37, as modified by N.J.Sup.Ct.Rules, Rule 21, 2 N.J.Misc. 1208 (1924); N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;258 as amended by Laws of 1935, ch. 339.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This provision for joinder of actions has been patterned upon [former] Equity Rule 26 (Joinder of Causes of Action) and broadened to include multiple parties. Compare the English practice, <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 18, r.r. 1&ndash;9 (noting rules 1 and 6). The earlier American codes set forth classes of joinder, following the now abandoned New York rule. See N.Y.C.P.A. &sect;258 before amended in 1935; Compare Kan.Gen.Stat.Ann. (1935) &sect;60&ndash;601; Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;263.04 for the more liberal practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The provisions of this rule for the joinder of claims are subject to Rule 82 (Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected). For the jurisdictional aspects of joinder of claims, see Shulman and Jaegerman, <em>Some Jurisdictional Limitations on Federal Procedure</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 393, 397&ndash;410. For separate trials of joined claims, see Rule 42(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. This rule is inserted to make it clear that in a single action a party should be accorded all the relief to which he is entitled regardless of whether it is legal or equitable or both. This necessarily includes a deficiency judgment in foreclosure actions formerly provided for in [former] Equity Rule 10 (Decree for Deficiency in Foreclosures, Etc.). In respect to fraudulent conveyances the rule changes the former rule requiring a prior judgment against the owner (<em>Braun v. American Laundry Mach. Co</em>., 56 F.(2d) 197 (S.D.N.Y. 1932)) to conform to the provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, &sect;&sect;9 and 10. See McLaughlin, <em>Application of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act</em>, 46 Harv.L.Rev. 404, 444 (1933).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rules &ldquo;proceed upon the theory that no inconvenience can result from the joinder of any two or more matters in the pleadings, but only from trying two or more matters together which have little or nothing in common.&rdquo; Sunderland, <em>The New Federal Rules</em>, 45 W.Va.L.Q. 5, 13 (1938); see Clark, <em>Code Pleading</em> 58 (2d ed. 1947). Accordingly, Rule 18(a) has permitted a party to plead multiple claims of all types against an opposing party, subject to the court's power to direct an appropriate procedure for trying the claims. See Rules 42(b), 20(b), 21.</p>
<p class="note-body">The liberal policy regarding joinder of claims in the pleadings extends to cases with multiple parties. However, the language used in the second sentence of Rule 18(a)&mdash;&ldquo;if the requirements of Rules 19 [necessary joinder of parties], 20 [permissive joinder of parties], and 22 [interpleader] are satisfied&rdquo;&mdash;has led some courts to infer that the rules regulating joinder of parties are intended to carry back to Rule 18(a) and to impose some special limits on joinder of claims in multiparty cases. In particular, Rule 20(a) has been read as restricting the operation of Rule 18(a) in certain situations in which a number of parties have been permissively joined in an action. In <em>Federal Housing Admr. v. Christianson</em>, 26 F.Supp. 419 (D.Conn. 1939), the indorsee of two notes sued the three comakers of one note, and sought to join in the action a count on a second note which had been made by two of the three defendants. There was no doubt about the propriety of the joinder of the three parties defendant, for a right to relief was being asserted against all three defendants which arose out of a single &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; (the first note) and a question of fact or law &ldquo;common&rdquo; to all three defendants would arise in the action. See the text of Rule 20(a). The court, however, refused to allow the joinder of the count on the second note, on the ground that this right to relief, assumed to arise from a distinct transaction, did not involve a question common to all the defendants but only two of them. For analysis of the Christianson case and other authorities, see 2 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em>, &sect;533.1 (Wright ed. 1961); 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, par. 18.04[3] (2d ed. 1963).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court's view is followed, it becomes necessary to enter at the pleading stage into speculations about the exact relation between the claim sought to be joined against fewer than all the defendants properly joined in the action, and the claims asserted against all the defendants. Cf. Wright, <em>Joinder of Claims and Parties Under Modern Pleading Rules</em>, 36 Minn.L.Rev. 580, 605&ndash;06 (1952). Thus if it could be found in the Christianson situation that the claim on the second note arose out of the same transaction as the claim on the first or out of a transaction forming part of a &ldquo;series,&rdquo; and that any question of fact or law with respect to the second note also arose with regard to the first, it would be held that the claim on the second note could be joined in the complaint. See 2 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, at 199; see also id. at 198 n. 60.4; cf. 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, supra, at 1811. Such pleading niceties provide a basis for delaying and wasteful maneuver. It is more compatible with the design of the Rules to allow the claim to be joined in the pleading, leaving the question of possible separate trial of that claim to be later decided. See 2 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, &sect;533.1; Wright, supra, 36 Minn.L.Rev. at 604&ndash;11; <em>Developments in the Law&mdash;Multiparty Litigation in the Federal Courts</em>, 71 Harv. 874, 970&ndash;71 (1958); Commentary, <em>Relation Between Joinder of Parties and Joinder of Claims</em>, 5 F.R.Serv. 822 (1942). It is instructive to note that the court in the Christianson case, while holding that the claim on the second note could not be joined as a matter of pleading, held open the possibility that both claims would later be consolidated for trial under Rule 42(a). See 26 F.Supp. 419.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:129 --><p class="note-body">Rule 18(a) is now amended not only to overcome the Christianson decision and similar authority, but also to state clearly as a comprehensive proposition, that a party asserting a claim (an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim) may join as many claims as he has against an opposing party. See <em>Noland Co., Inc. v. Graver Tank & Mfg. Co</em>., 301 F.2d 43, 49&ndash;51 (4th Cir. 1962); but cf. <em>C. W. Humphrey Co. v. Security Alum. Co</em>., 31 F.R.D. 41 (E.D.Mich. 1962) This permitted joinder of claims is not affected by the fact that there are multiple parties in the action. The joinder of parties is governed by other rules operating independently.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is emphasized that amended Rule 18(a) deals only with pleading. As already indicated, a claim properly joined as a matter of pleading need not be proceeded with together with the other claim if fairness or convenience justifies separate treatment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended Rule 18(a), like the rule prior to amendment, does not purport to deal with questions of jurisdiction or venue which may arise with respect to claims properly joined as a matter of pleading. See Rule 82.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also the amendment of Rule 20(a) and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body">Free joinder of claims and remedies is one of the basic purposes of unification of the admiralty and civil procedure. The amendment accordingly provides for the inclusion in the rule of maritime claims as well as those which are legal and equitable in character.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Persons To Be Joined if Feasible</cap-smallcap>. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff. If the joined party objects to venue and joinder of that party would render the venue of the action improper, that party shall be dismissed from the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Determination by Court Whenever Joinder Not Feasible</cap-smallcap>. If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder</cap-smallcap>. A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall state the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exception of Class Actions</cap-smallcap>. This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 23.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>General Considerations</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Whenever feasible, the persons materially interested in the subject of an action&mdash;see the more detailed description of these persons in the discussion of new subdivision (a) below&mdash;should be joined as parties so that they may be heard and a complete disposition made. When this comprehensive joinder cannot be accomplished&mdash;a situation which may be encountered in Federal courts because of limitations on service of process, subject matter jurisdiction, and venue&mdash;the case should be examined pragmatically and a choice made between the alternatives of proceeding with the action in the absence of particular interested persons, and dismissing the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">Even if the court is mistaken in its decision to proceed in the absence of an interested person, it does not by that token deprive itself of the power to adjudicate as between the parties already before it through proper service of process. But the court can make a legally binding adjudication only between the parties actually joined in the action. It is true that an adjudication between the parties before the court may on occasion adversely affect the absent person as a practical matter, or leave a party exposed to a later inconsistent recovery by the absent person. These are factors which should be considered in deciding whether the action should proceed, or should rather be dismissed; but they do not themselves negate the court's power to adjudicate as between the parties who have been joined.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:130 --><h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Defects in the Original Rule</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The foregoing propositions were well understood in the older equity practice, see Hazard, <em>Indispensable Party: The Historical Origin of a Procedural Phantom</em>, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1254 (1961), and Rule 19 could be and often was applied in consonance with them. But experience showed that the rule was defective in its phrasing and did not point clearly to the proper basis of decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Textual defects.&mdash;(1) The expression &ldquo;persons *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* who ought to be parties if complete relief is to be accorded between those already parties,&rdquo; appearing in original subdivision (b), was apparently intended as a description of the persons whom it would be desirable to join in the action, all questions of feasibility of joinder being put to one side; but it was not adequately descriptive of those persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The word &ldquo;Indispensable,&rdquo; appearing in original subdivision (b), was apparently intended as an inclusive reference to the interested persons in whose absence it would be advisable, all factors having been considered, to dismiss the action. Yet the sentence implied that there might be interested persons, not &ldquo;indispensable.&rdquo; in whose absence the action ought also to be dismissed. Further, it seemed at least superficially plausible to equate the word &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; with the expression &ldquo;having a joint interest,&rdquo; appearing in subdivision (a). See <em>United States v. Washington Inst. of Tech., Inc</em>., 138 F.2d 25, 26 (3d Cir. 1943); cf. <em>Chidester v. City of Newark</em>, 162 F.2d 598 (3d Cir. 1947). But persons holding an interest technically &ldquo;joint&rdquo; are not always so related to an action that it would be unwise to proceed without joining all of them, whereas persons holding an interest not technically &ldquo;joint&rdquo; may have this relation to an action. See Reed, <em>Compulsory Joinder of Parties in Civil Actions</em>, 55 Mich.L.Rev. 327, 356 ff., 483 (1957).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The use of &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint interest&rdquo; in the context of original Rule 19 directed attention to the technical or abstract character of the rights or obligations of the persons whose joinder was in question, and correspondingly distracted attention from the pragmatic considerations which should be controlling.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The original rule, in dealing with the feasibility of joining a person as a party to the action, besides referring to whether the person was &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction of the court as to both service of process and venue,&rdquo; spoke of whether the person could be made a party &ldquo;without depriving the court of jurisdiction of the parties before it.&rdquo; The second quoted expression used &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; in the sense of the competence of the court over the subject matter of the action, and in this sense the expression was apt. However, by a familiar confusion, the expression seems to have suggested to some that the absence from the lawsuit of a person who was &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; or &ldquo;who ought to be [a] part[y]&rdquo; itself deprived the court of the power to adjudicate as between the parties already joined. See <em>Samuel Goldwyn, Inc. v. United Artists Corp</em>., 113 F.2d 703, 707 (3d Cir. 1940); <em>McArthur v. Rosenbaum Co. of Pittsburgh</em>, 180 F.2d 617, 621 (3d Cir. 1949); cf. <em>Calcote v. Texas Pac. Coal & Oil Co</em>., 157 F.2d 216 (5th Cir. 1946), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 782 (1946), noted in 56 Yale L.J. 1088 (1947); Reed, supra, 55 Mich.L.Rev. at 332&ndash;34.</p>
<p class="note-body">Failure to point to correct basis of decision. The original rule did not state affirmatively what factors were relevant in deciding whether the action should proceed or be dismissed when joinder of interested persons was infeasible. In some instances courts did not undertake the relevant inquiry or were misled by the &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; fallacy. In other instances there was undue preoccupation with abstract classifications of rights or obligations, as against consideration of the particular consequences of proceeding with the action and the ways by which these consequences might be ameliorated by the shaping of final relief or other precautions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although these difficulties cannot be said to have been general analysis of the cases showed that there was good reason for attempting to strengthen the rule. The literature also indicated how the rule should be reformed. See Reed, supra (discussion of the important case of <em>Shields v. Barrow</em>, 17 How. (58 U.S.) 130 (1854), appears at 55 Mich.L.Rev., p. 340 ff.); Hazard, supra; N.Y. Temporary Comm. on Courts, First Preliminary Report, Legis.Doc. 1957, No. 6(b), pp. 28, 233; N.Y. Judicial Council, Twelfth Ann.Rep., Legis.Doc. 1946, No. 17, p. 163; Joint Comm. on Michigan Procedural Revision, Final Report, Pt. III, p. 69 (1960); Note, <em>Indispensable Parties in the Federal Courts</em>, 65 Harv.L.Rev. 1050 (1952); <em>Developments in the Law&mdash;Multiparty Litigation in the Federal Courts</em>, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 874, 879 (1958); Mich.Gen.Court Rules, R. 205 (effective Jan. 1, 1963); N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law & Rules, &sect;1001 (effective Sept. 1, 1963).</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>The Amended Rule</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (a) defines the persons whose joinder in the action is desirable. Clause (1) stresses the desirability of joining those persons in whose absence the court would be obliged to grant partial or &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; rather than complete relief to the parties before the court. The interests that are being furthered here are not only those of the parties, but also that of the public in avoiding repeated lawsuits on the same essential subject matter. Clause (2)(i) recognizes the importance of protecting the person whose joinder is in question against the practical prejudice to him which may arise through a disposition of the action in his absence. Clause (2)(ii) recognizes the need for considering whether a party may be left, after the adjudication, in a position where a person not joined can subject him to a double or otherwise inconsistent liability. See Reed, supra, 55 Mich.L.Rev. at 330, 338; Note, supra, 65 Harv.L.Rev. at 1052&ndash;57; Developments in the Law, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 881&ndash;85.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision (a) definition of persons to be joined is not couched in terms of the abstract nature of their interests&mdash;&ldquo;joint,&rdquo; &ldquo;united,&rdquo; &ldquo;separable,&rdquo; or the like. See N.Y. Temporary Comm. on Courts, First Preliminary Report, supra; Developments in the Law, supra, at 880. It should be noted particularly, however, that the description is not at variance with the settled authorities holding that a tortfeasor with the usual &ldquo;joint-and-several&rdquo; liability is merely a permissive party to an action against another with like liability. See 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> 2153 (2d ed. 1963); 2 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;513.8 (Wright ed. 1961). Joinder of these tortfeasors continues to be regulated by Rule 20; compare Rule 14 on third-party practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)(2) is amenable to service of process and his joinder would not deprive the court of jurisdiction in the sense of competence over the action, he should be joined as a party; and if he has not been joined, the court should order him to be brought into the action. If a party joined has a valid objection to the venue and chooses to assert it, he will be dismissed from the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;When a person as described in subdivision (a)(1)&ndash;(2) cannot be made a party, the court is to determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties already before it, or should be dismissed. That this decision is to be made in the light of pragmatic considerations has often been acknowledged by the courts. See <em>Roos v. Texas Co</em>., 23 F.2d 171 (2d Cir. 1927), cert. denied, 277 U.S. 587 (1928); <em>Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders, Union</em>, 254 U.S. 77, 80 (1920). The subdivision sets out four relevant considerations drawn from the experience revealed in the decided cases. The factors are to a certain extent overlapping, and they are not intended to exclude other considerations which may be applicable in particular situations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first factor brings in a consideration of what a judgment in the action would mean to the absentee. Would the absentee be adversely affected in a practical sense, and if so, would the prejudice be immediate and serious, or remote and minor? The possible collateral consequences of the judgment upon the parties already joined are also to be appraised. Would any party be ex<!-- PDFPage:131 -->posed to a fresh action by the absentee, and if so, how serious is the threat? See the elaborate discussion in Reed, supra; cf. <em>A. L. Smith Iron Co. v. Dickson</em>, 141 F.2d 3 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>Caldwell Mfg. Co. v. Unique Balance Co</em>., 18 F.R.D. 258 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second factor calls attention to the measures by which prejudice may be averted or lessened. The &ldquo;shaping of relief&rdquo; is a familiar expedient to this end. See, e.g., the award of money damages in lieu of specific relief where the latter might affect an absentee adversely. <em>Ward v. Deavers</em>, 203 F.2d 72 (D.C.Cir. 1953); <em>Miller & Lux, Inc. v. Nickel</em>, 141 F.Supp. 41 (N.D.Calif. 1956). On the use of &ldquo;protective provisions,&rdquo; see <em>Roos v. Texas Co</em>., supra; <em>Atwood v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co</em>., 275 Fed. 513, 519 (1st Cir. 1921), cert. denied, 257 U.S. 661 (1922); cf. <em>Stumpf v. Fidelity Gas Co</em>., 294 F.2d 886 (9th Cir. 1961); and the general statement in <em>National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board</em>, 309 U.S. 350, 363 (1940).</p>
<p class="note-body">Sometimes the party is himself able to take measures to avoid prejudice. Thus a defendant faced with a prospect of a second suit by an absentee may be in a position to bring the latter into the action by defensive interpleader. See <em>Hudson v. Newell</em>, 172 F.2d 848, 852 mod., 176 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1949); <em>Gauss v. Kirk</em>, 198 F.2d 83, 86 (D.C.Cir. 1952); <em>Abel v. Brayton Flying Service, Inc</em>., 248 F.2d 713, 716 (5th Cir. 1957) (suggestion of possibility of counterclaim under Rule 13(h)); cf. <em>Parker Rust-Proof Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co</em>., 105 F.2d 976 (2d Cir. 1939) cert. denied, 308 U.S. 597 (1939). See also the absentee may sometimes be able to avert prejudice to himself by voluntarily appearing in the action or intervening on an ancillary basis. See <em>Developments in the Law</em>, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 882; Annot., <em>Intervention or Subsequent Joinder of Parties as Affecting Jurisdiction of Federal Court Based on Diversity of Citizenship</em>, 134 A.L.R. 335 (1941); <em>Johnson v. Middleton</em>, 175 F.2d 535 (7th Cir. 1949); <em>Kentucky Nat. Gas Corp. v. Duggins</em>, 165 F.2d 1011 (6th Cir. 1948); <em>McComb v. McCormack</em>, 159 F.2d 219 (5th Cir. 1947). The court should consider whether this, in turn, would impose undue hardship on the absentee. (For the possibility of the court's informing an absentee of the pendency of the action, see comment under subdivision (c) below.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The third factor&mdash;whether an &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; judgment can be rendered in the absence of a given person&mdash;calls attention to the extent of the relief that can be accorded among the parties joined. It meshes with the other factors, especially the &ldquo;shaping of relief&rdquo; mentioned under the second factor. Cf. <em>Kroese v. General Steel Castings Corp</em>., 179 F.2d 760 (3d Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 983 (1950).</p>
<p class="note-body">The fourth factor, looking to the practical effects of a dismissal, indicates that the court should consider whether there is any assurance that the plaintiff, if dismissed, could sue effectively in another forum where better joinder would be possible. See <em>Fitzgerald v. Haynes</em>, 241 F.2d 417, 420 (3d Cir. 1957); <em>Fouke v. Schenewerk</em>, 197 F.2d 234, 236 (5th Cir. 1952); cf. <em>Warfield v. Marks</em>, 190 F.2d 178 (5th Cir. 1951).</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision uses the word &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; only in a conclusory sense, that is, a person is &ldquo;regarded as indispensable&rdquo; when he cannot be made a party and, upon consideration of the factors above mention, it is determined that in his absence it would be preferable to dismiss the action, rather than to retain it.</p>
<p class="note-body">A person may be added as a party at any stage of the action on motion or on the court's initiative (see Rule 21); and a motion to dismiss, on the ground that a person has not been joined and justice requires that the action should not proceed in his absence, may be made as late as the trial on the merits (see Rule 12(h)(2), as amended; cf. Rule 12(b)(7), as amended). However, when the moving party is seeking dismissal in order to protect himself against a later suit by the absent person (subdivision (a)(2)(ii)), and is not seeking vicariously to protect the absent person against a prejudicial judgment (subdivision (a)(2)(i)), his undue delay in making the motion can properly be counted against him as a reason for denying the motion. A joinder question should be decided with reasonable promptness, but decision may properly be deferred if adequate information is not available at the time. Thus the relationship of an absent person to the action, and the practical effects of an adjudication upon him and others, may not be sufficiently revealed at the pleading stage; in such a case it would be appropriate to defer decision until the action was further advanced. Cf. Rule 12(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule makes no special provision for the problem arising in suits against subordinate Federal officials where it has often been set up as a defense that some superior officer must be joined. Frequently this defense has been accompanied by or intermingled with defenses of sovereign community or lack of consent of the United States to suit. So far as the issue of joinder can be isolated from the rest, the new subdivision seems better adapted to handle it than the predecessor provision. See the discussion in <em>Johnson v. Kirkland</em>, 290 F.2d 440, 446&ndash;47 (5th Cir. 1961) (stressing the practical orientation of the decisions); <em>Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro</em>, 349 U.S. 48, 54 (1955). Recent legislation, P.L. 87&ndash;748, 76 Stat. 744, approved October 5, 1962, adding &sect;&sect;1361, 1391(e) to Title 28, U.S.C., vests original jurisdiction in the District Courts over actions in the nature of mandamus to compel officials of the United States to perform their legal duties, and extends the range of service of process and liberalizes venue in these actions. If, then, it is found that a particular official should be joined in the action, the legislation will make it easy to bring him in.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) parallels the predecessor subdivision (c) of Rule 19. In some situations it may be desirable to advise a person who has not been joined of the fact that the action is pending, and in particular cases the court in its discretion may itself convey this information by directing a letter or other informal notice to the absentee.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) repeats the exception contained in the first clause of the predecessor subdivision (a).</p>

<p class="note-body">See the amendment of Rule 18(a) and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto. It has been thought that a lack of clarity in the antecedent of the word &ldquo;them,&rdquo; as it appeared in two places in Rule 20(a), contributed to the view, taken by some courts, that this rule limited the joinder of claims in certain situations of permissive party joinder. Although the amendment of Rule 18(a) should make clear that this view is untenable, it has been considered advisable to amend Rule 20(a) to eliminate any ambiguity. See 2 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> 202 (Wright Ed. 1961).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff avers that the plaintiff is not liable in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants. A defendant exposed to similar liability may obtain such interpleader by way of cross-claim or counterclaim. The provisions of this rule supplement and do not in any way limit the joinder of parties permitted in Rule 20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The remedy herein provided is in addition to and in no way supersedes or limits the remedy provided by Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;&sect;1335, 1397, and 2361. Actions under those provisions shall be conducted in accordance with these rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first paragraph provides for interpleader relief along the newer and more liberal lines of joinder in the alternative. It avoids the confusion and restrictions that developed around actions of strict interpleader and actions in the nature of interpleader. Compare <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Kegan et al</em>., (D.C.Md., 1938) [22 F.Supp. 326]. It does not change the rules on service of process, jurisdiction, and venue, as established by judicial decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph allows an action to be brought under the recent interpleader statute when applicable. By this paragraph all remedies under the statute are continued, but the manner of obtaining them is in accordance with these rules. For temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions under this statute, see Rule 65(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule substantially continues such statutory provisions as U.S.C., Title 38, &sect;445 [now 1984] (Actions on claims; jurisdiction; parties; procedure; limitation; witnesses; definitions) (actions upon veterans&rsquo; contracts of insurance with the United States), providing for interpleader by the United States where it acknowledges indebtedness under a contract of insurance with the United States; U.S.C., Title 49, &sect;97 [now 80110(e)] (Interpleader of conflicting claimants) (by carrier which has issued bill of lading).

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prerequisites to a Class Action</cap-smallcap>. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Class Actions Maintainable</cap-smallcap>. An action may be maintained as a class action if the pre<!-- PDFPage:133 -->requisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination by Order Whether Class Action To Be Maintained; Notice; Judgment; Actions Conducted Partially as Class Actions.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained. An order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In any class action maintained under subdivision (b)(3), the court shall direct to the members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice shall advise each member that (A) the court will exclude the member from the class if the member so requests by a specified date; (B) the judgment, whether favorable or not, will include all members who do not request exclusion; and (C) any member who does not request exclusion may, if the member desires, enter an appearance through counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under subdivision (b)(1) or (b)(2), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and describe those whom the court finds to be members of the class. The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under subdivision (b)(3), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and specify or describe those to whom the notice provided in subdivision (c)(2) was directed, and who have not requested exclusion, and whom the court finds to be members of the class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) When appropriate (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Orders in Conduct of Actions</cap-smallcap>. In the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders: (1) determining the course of proceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument; (2) requiring, for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in such manner as the court may direct to some or all of the members of any step in the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to intervene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come into the action; (3) imposing conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors; (4) requiring that the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allegations as to representation of absent persons, and that the action proceed accordingly; (5) dealing with similar procedural matters. The orders may be combined with an order under Rule 16, and may be altered or amended as may be desirable from time to time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Dismissal or Compromise</cap-smallcap>. A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>. A court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order. An appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. This is a substantial restatement of [former] Equity Rule 38 (Representatives of Class) as that rule has been construed. It applies to all actions, whether formerly denominated legal or equitable. For a general analysis of class actions, effect of judgment, and requisites of jurisdiction see Moore, <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: Some Problems Raised by the Preliminary Draft</em>, 25 Georgetown L.J. 551, 570 <em>et seq</em>. (1937); Moore and Cohn, <em>Federal Class Actions</em>, 32 Ill.L.Rev. 307 (1937); Moore and Cohn, <em>Federal Class Actions&mdash;Jurisdiction and Effect of Judgment</em>, 32 Ill.L.Rev. 555&mdash;567 (1938); Lesar, <em>Class Suits and the Federal Rules</em>, 22 Minn.L.Rev. 34 (1937); <em>cf</em>. Arnold and James, <em>Cases on Trials, Judgments and Appeals</em> (1936) 175; and see Blume, <em>Jurisdictional Amount in Representative Suits</em>, 15 Minn.L.Rev. 501 (1931).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:134 --><p class="note-body">The general test of [former] Equity Rule 38 (Representatives of Class) that the question should be &ldquo;one of common or general interest to many persons constituting a class so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court,&rdquo; is a common test. For states which require the two elements of a common or general interest and numerous persons, as provided for in [former] Equity Rule 38, see Del.Ch.Rule 113; Fla.Comp.Gen.Laws Ann. (Supp., 1936) &sect;4918 (7); Georgia Code (1933) &sect;37&ndash;1002, and see <em>English Rules Under the Judicature Act</em> (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 16, r. 9. For statutory provisions providing for class actions when the question is one of common or general interest or when the parties are numerous, see Ala.Code Ann. (Michie, 1928) &sect;5701; 2 Ind.Stat.Ann. (Burns, 1933) &sect;2&ndash;220; N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;195; Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;260.12. These statutes have, however, been uniformly construed as though phrased in the conjunctive. See <em>Garfein v. Stiglitz</em>, 260 Ky. 430, 86 S.W.(2d) 155 (1935). The rule adopts the test of [former] Equity Rule 38, but defines what constitutes a &ldquo;common or general interest&rdquo;. Compare with code provisions which make the action dependent upon the propriety of joinder of the parties. See Blume, <em>The &ldquo;Common Questions&rdquo; Principle in the Code Provision for Representative Suits</em>, 30 Mich.L.Rev. 878 (1932). For discussion of what constitutes &ldquo;numerous persons&rdquo; see Wheaton, <em>Representative Suits Involving Numerous Litigants</em>, 19 Corn.L.Q. 399 (1934); Note, 36 Harv.L.Rev. 89 (1922).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Clause (1), Joint, Common, or Secondary Right</em>. This clause is illustrated in actions brought by or against representatives of an unincorporated association. See <em>Oster v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen</em>, 271 Pa. 419, 114 Atl. 377 (1921); <em>Pickett v. Walsh</em>, 192 Mass. 572, 78 N.E. 753, 6 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1067 (1906); <em>Colt v. Hicks</em>, 97 Ind.App. 177, 179 N.E. 335 (1932). Compare Rule 17(b) as to when an unincorporated association has capacity to sue or be sued in its common name; <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co</em>., 259 U.S. 344 (1922) (an unincorporated association was sued as an entity for the purpose of enforcing against it a federal substantive right); Moore, <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: Some Problems Raised by the Preliminary Draft</em>, 25 Georgetown L.J. 551, 566 (for discussion of jurisdictional requisites when an unincorporated association sues or is sued in its common name and jurisdiction is founded upon diversity of citizenship). For an action brought by representatives of one group against representatives of another group for distribution of a fund held by an unincorporated association, see <em>Smith v. Swormstedt</em>, 16 How. 288 (U.S. 1853). Compare <em>Christopher, et al. v. Brusselback</em>, 58 S.Ct. 350 [302 U.S. 500] (1938).</p>
<p class="note-body">For an action to enforce rights held in common by policyholders against the corporate issuer of the policies, see <em>Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur v. Cauble</em>, 255 U.S. 356 (1921). See also <em>Terry v. Little</em>, 101 U.S. 216 (1880); <em>John A. Roebling's Sons Co. v. Kinnicutt</em>, 248 Fed. 596 (D.C.N.Y., 1917) dealing with the right held in common by creditors to enforce the statutory liability of stockholders.</p>
<p class="note-body">Typical of a secondary action is a suit by stockholders to enforce a corporate right. For discussion of the general nature of these actions see <em>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority</em>, 297 U.S. 288 (1936); Glenn, <em>The Stockholder's Suit&mdash;Corporate and Individual Grievances</em>, 33 Yale L.J. 580 (1924); McLaughlin, <em>Capacity of Plaintiff-Stockholder to Terminate a Stockholder's Suit</em>, 46 Yale L.J. 421 (1937). See also <em>Subdivision (b)</em> of this rule which deals with Shareholder's Action; Note, 15 Minn.L.Rev. 453 (1931).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Clause (2)</em>. A creditor's action for liquidation or reorganization of a corporation is illustrative of this clause. An action by a stockholder against certain named defendants as representatives of numerous claimants presents a situation converse to the creditor's action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Clause (3)</em>. See <em>Everglades Drainage League v. Napoleon Broward Drainage Dist</em>., 253 Fed. 246 (D.C.Fla., 1918); <em>Gramling v. Maxwell</em>, 52 F.(2d) 256 (D.C.N.C., 1931), approved in 30 Mich.L.Rev. 624 (1932); <em>Skinner v. Mitchell</em>, 108 Kan. 861, 197 Pac. 569 (1921); <em>Duke of Bedford v. Ellis</em> (1901) A.C. 1, for class actions when there were numerous persons and there was only a question of law or fact common to them; and see Blume, <em>The &ldquo;Common Questions&rdquo; Principle in the Code Provision for Representative Suits</em>, 30 Mich.L.Rev. 878 (1932).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (b)</em>. This is [former] Equity Rule 27 (Stockholder's Bill) with verbal changes. See also <em>Hawes v. Oakland</em>, 104 U.S. 450, 26 L.Ed. 827 (1882) and former Equity Rule 94, promulgated January 23, 1882, 104 U.S. IX.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1946 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b), relating to secondary actions by shareholders, provides among other things, that in, such an action the complainant &ldquo;shall aver (1) that the plaintiff was a shareholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains or that his share thereafter devolved on him by operation of law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">As a result of the decision in <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, 304 U.S. 64 (decided April 25, 1938, after this rule was promulgated by the Supreme Court, though before it took effect) a question has arisen as to whether the provision above quoted deals with a matter of substantive right or is a matter of procedure. If it is a matter of substantive law or right, then under <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em> clause (1) may not be validly applied in cases pending in states whose local law permits a shareholder to maintain such actions, although not a shareholder at the time of the transactions complained of. The Advisory Committee, believing the question should be settled in the courts, proposes no change in Rule 23 but thinks rather that the situation should be explained in an appropriate note.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule has a long history. In <em>Hawes v. Oakland</em> (1882) 104 U.S. 450, the Court held that a shareholder could not maintain such an action unless he owned shares at the time of the transactions complained of, or unless they devolved on him by operation of law. At that time the decision in <em>Swift v. Tyson</em> (1842) 16 Peters 1, was the law, and the federal courts considered themselves free to establish their own principles of equity jurisprudence, so the Court was not in 1882 and has not been, until <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em> in 1938, concerned with the question whether <em>Hawes v. Oakland</em> dealt with substantive right or procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">Following the decision in <em>Hawes v. Oakland</em>, and at the same term, the Court, to implement its decision, adopted [former] Equity Rule 94, which contained the same provision above quoted from Rule 23 F.R.C.P. The provision in [former] Equity Rule 94 was later embodied in [former] Equity Rule 27, of which the present Rule 23 is substantially a copy.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>City of Quincy v. Steel</em> (1887) 120 U.S. 241, 245, the Court referring to <em>Hawes v. Oakland</em> said: &ldquo;In order to give effect to the principles there laid down, this Court at that term adopted Rule 94 of the rules of practice for courts of equity of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Some other cases dealing with [former] Equity Rules 94 or 27 prior to the decision in <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em> are <em>Dimpfel v. Ohio & Miss. R. R</em>. (1884) 110 U.S. 209; <em>Illinois Central R. Co. v. Adams</em> (1901) 180 U.S. 28, 34; <em>Venner v. Great Northern Ry</em>. (1908) 209 U.S. 24, 30; <em>Jacobson v. General Motors Corp</em>. (S.D.N.Y. 1938) 22 F.Supp. 255, 257. These cases generally treat <em>Hawes v. Oakland</em> as establishing a &ldquo;principle&rdquo; of equity, or as dealing not with jurisdiction but with the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to maintain an action, or have said that the defense under the equity rule is analogous to the defense that the plaintiff has no &ldquo;title&rdquo; and results in a dismissal &ldquo;for want of equity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Those state decisions which held that a shareholder acquiring stock after the event may maintain a derivative action are founded on the view that it is a right belonging to the shareholder at the time of the transaction and which passes as a right to the subsequent purchaser. See <em>Pollitz v. Gould</em> (1911) 202 N.Y. 11.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:135 --><p class="note-body">The first case arising after the decision in <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, in which this problem was involved, was <em>Summers v. Hearst</em> (S.D.N.Y. 1938) 23 F.Supp. 986. It concerned [former] Equity Rule 27, as Federal Rule 23 was not then in effect. In a well considered opinion Judge Leibell reviewed the decisions and said: &ldquo;The federal cases that discuss this section of Rule 27 support the view that it states a principle of substantive law.&rdquo; He quoted <em>Pollitz v. Gould</em> (1911) 202 N.Y. 11, as saying that the United States Supreme Court &ldquo;seems to have been more concerned with establishing this rule as one of practice than of substantive law&rdquo; but that &ldquo;whether it be regarded as establishing a principle of law or a rule of practice, this authority has been subsequently followed in the United States courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">He then concluded that, although the federal decisions treat the equity rule as &ldquo;stating a principle of substantive law&rdquo;, if [former] &ldquo;Equity Rule 27 is to be modified or revoked in view of <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, it is not the province of this Court to suggest it, much less impliedly to follow that course by disregarding the mandatory provisions of the Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Some other federal decisions since 1938 touch the question.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Piccard v. Sperry Corporation</em> (S.D.N.Y. 1941) 36 F.Supp. 1006, 1009&ndash;10, affirmed without opinion (C.C.A.2d, 1941) 120 F.(2d) 328, a shareholder, not such at the time of the transactions complained of, sought to intervene. The court held an intervenor was as much subject to Rule 23 as an original plaintiff; and that the requirement of Rule 23(b) was &ldquo;a matter of practice,&rdquo; not substance, and applied in New York where the state law was otherwise, despite <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>. In <em>York v. Guaranty Trust Co. of New York</em> (C.C.A.2d, 1944) 143 F.(2d) 503, rev'd on other grounds (1945) 65 S.Ct. 1464, the court said: &ldquo;Restrictions on the bringing of stockholders&rsquo; actions, such as those imposed by F.R.C.P. 23(b) or other state statutes are procedural,&rdquo; citing the <em>Piccard</em> and other cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Gallup v. Caldwell</em> (C.C.A.3d, 1941) 120 F.(2d) 90, 95, arising in New Jersey, the point was raised but not decided, the court saying that it was not satisfied that the then New Jersey rule differed from Rule 23(b), and that &ldquo;under the circumstances the proper course was to follow Rule 23(b).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Mullins v. De Soto Securities Co</em>. (W.D.La. 1942) 45 F.Supp. 871, 878, the point was not decided, because the court found the Louisiana rule to be the same as that stated in Rule 23(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Toebelman v. Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co</em>. (D.Del. 1941) 41 F.Supp. 334, 340, the court dealt only with another part of Rule 23(b), relating to prior demands on the stockholders and did not discuss <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins</em>, or its effect on the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Perrott v. United States Banking Corp</em>. (D.Del. 1944) 53 F.Supp. 953, it appeared that the Delaware law does not require the plaintiff to have owned shares at the time of the transaction complained of. The court sustained Rule 23(b), after discussion of the authorities, saying:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It seems to me the rule does not go beyond procedure. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Simply because a particular plaintiff cannot qualify as a proper party to maintain such an action does not destroy or even whittle at the cause of action. The cause of action exists until a qualified plaintiff can get it started in a federal court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Bankers Nat. Corp. v. Barr</em> (S.D.N.Y. 1945) 9 Fed.Rules Serv. 23b.11, Case 1, the court held Rule 23(b) to be one of procedure, but that whether the plaintiff was a stockholder was a substantive question to be settled by state law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The New York rule, as stated in <em>Pollitz v. Gould, supra</em>, has been altered by an act of the New York Legislature (Chapter 667, Laws of 1944, effective April 9, 1944, General Corporation Law, &sect;61) which provides that &ldquo;in any action brought by a shareholder in the right of a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. corporation, it must appear that the plaintiff was a stockholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains, or that his stock thereafter devolved upon him by operation of law.&rdquo; At the same time a further and separate provision was enacted, requiring under certain circumstances the giving of security for reasonable expenses and attorney's fees, to which security the corporation in whose right the action is brought and the defendants therein may have recourse. (Chapter 668, Laws of 1944, effective April 9, 1944, General Corporation Law, &sect;61&ndash;b.) These provisions are aimed at so-called &ldquo;strike&rdquo; stockholders&rsquo; suits and their attendant abuses. <em>Shielcrawt v. Moffett</em> (Ct.App. 1945) 294 N.Y. 180, 61 N.E.(2d) 435, rev'g 51 N.Y.S.(2d) 188, aff'g 49 N.Y.S.(2d) 64; <em>Noel Associates, Inc. v. Merrill</em> (Sup.Ct. 1944) 184 Misc. 646, 53 N.Y.S.(2d) 143.</p>
<p class="note-body">Insofar as &sect;61 is concerned, it has been held that the section is procedural in nature. <em>Klum v. Clinton Trust Co</em>. (Sup.Ct. 1944) 183 Misc. 340, 48 N.Y.S.(2d) 267; <em>Noel Associates, Inc. v. Merrill, supra</em>. In the latter case the court pointed out that &ldquo;The 1944 amendment to Section 61 rejected the rule laid down in the <em>Pollitz</em> case and substituted, in place thereof, in its precise language, the rule which has long prevailed in the Federal Courts and which is now Rule 23(b) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; There is, nevertheless, a difference of opinion regarding the application of the statute to pending actions. See <em>Klum v. Clinton Trust Co., supra</em> (applicable); <em>Noel Associates, Inc. v. Merrill, supra</em> (inapplicable).</p>
<p class="note-body">With respect to &sect;61&ndash;b, which may be regarded as a separate problem (<em>Noel Associates, Inc. v. Merrill, supra</em>), it has been held that even though the statute is procedural in nature&mdash;a matter not definitely decided&mdash;the Legislature evinced no intent that the provision should apply to actions pending when it became effective. <em>Shielcrawt v. Moffett, supra</em>. As to actions instituted after the effective date of the legislation, the constitutionality of &sect;61&ndash;b is in dispute. See <em>Wolf v. Atkinson</em> (Sup.Ct. 1944) 182 Misc. 675, 49 N.Y.S.(2d) 703 (constitutional); <em>Citron v. Mangel Stores Corp</em>. (Sup.Ct. 1944) &mdash; Misc. &mdash;, 50 N.Y.S.(2d) 416 (unconstitutional); Zlinkoff, <em>The American Investor and the Constitutionality of Section 61&ndash;B of the New York General Corporation Law</em> (1945) 54 Yale L.J. 352.</p>
<p class="note-body">New Jersey also enacted a statute, similar to Chapters 667 and 668 of the New York law. See P.L. 1945, Ch. 131, R.S.Cum.Supp. 14:3&ndash;15. The New Jersey provision similar to Chapter 668 (&sect;61&ndash;b) differs, however, in that it specifically applies retroactively. It has been held that this provision is procedural and hence will not govern a pending action brought against a New Jersey corporation in the New York courts. <em>Shielcrawt v. Moffett</em> (Sup.Ct.N.Y. 1945) 184 Misc. 1074, 56 N.Y.S.(2d) 134.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also generally, 2 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> (1938) 2250&ndash;2253, and Cum.Supplement &sect;23.05.</p>
<p class="note-body">The decisions here discussed show that the question is a debatable one, and that there is respectable authority for either view, with a recent trend towards the view that Rule 23(b)(1) is procedural. There is reason to say that the question is one which should not be decided by the Supreme Court <em>ex parte</em>, but left to await a judicial decision in a litigated case, and that in the light of the material in this note, the only inference to be drawn from a failure to amend Rule 23(b) would be that the question is postponed to await a litigated case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee is unanimously of the opinion that this course should be followed.</p>
<p class="note-body">If, however, the final conclusion is that the rule deals with a matter of substantive right, then the rule should be amended by adding a provision that Rule 23(b)(1) does not apply in jurisdictions where state law permits a shareholder to maintain a secondary action, although he was not a shareholder at the time of the transactions of which he complains.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Difficulties with the original rule</em>. The categories of class actions in the original rule were defined in terms of the abstract nature of the rights involved: the so-called &ldquo;true&rdquo; category was defined as involving &ldquo;joint, common, or secondary rights&rdquo;; the &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; category, as involving &ldquo;several&rdquo; rights related to &ldquo;specific prop<!-- PDFPage:136 -->erty&rdquo;; the &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; category, as involving &ldquo;several&rdquo; rights affected by a common question and related to common relief. It was thought that the definitions accurately described the situations amendable to the class-suit device, and also would indicate the proper extent of the judgment in each category, which would in turn help to determine the res judicata effect of the judgment if questioned in a later action. Thus the judgments in &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; class actions would extend to the class (although in somewhat different ways); the judgment in a &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; class action would extend only to the parties including intervenors. See Moore, <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: Some Problems Raised by the Preliminary Draft</em>, 25 Geo.L.J. 551, 570&ndash;76 (1937).</p>
<p class="note-body">In practice, the terms &ldquo;joint,&rdquo; &ldquo;common,&rdquo; etc., which were used as the basis of the Rule 23 classification proved obscure and uncertain. See Chaffee, <em>Some Problems of Equity</em> 245&ndash;46, 256&ndash;57 (1950); Kalven & Rosenfield, <em>The Contemporary Function of the Class Suit</em>, 8 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 684, 707 & n. 73 (1941); Keeffe, Levy & Donovan, <em>Lee Defeats Ben Hur</em>, 33 Corn.L.Q. 327, 329&ndash;36 (1948); <em>Developments in the Law: Multiparty Litigation in the Federal Courts</em>, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 874, 931 (1958); Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 19, as amended. The courts had considerable difficulty with these terms. See, e.g., <em>Gullo v. Veterans&rsquo; Coop. H. Assn</em>., 13 F.R.D. 11 (D.D.C. 1952); <em>Shipley v. Pittsburgh & L. E. R. Co</em>., 70 F.Supp. 870 (W.D.Pa. 1947); <em>Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp</em>., 27 F.Supp. 763 (E.D.Pa. 1939), rev'd, 108 F.2d 51 (3d Cir. 1939), rev'd, 311 U.S. 282 (1940), on remand, 39 F.Supp. 592 (E.D.Pa. 1941), rev'd sub nom. <em>Pennsylvania Co. for Ins. on Lives v. Deckert</em>, 123 F.2d 979 (3d Cir. 1941) (see Chafee, supra, at 264&ndash;65).</p>
<p class="note-body">Nor did the rule provide an adequate guide to the proper extent of the judgments in class actions. First, we find instances of the courts classifying actions as &ldquo;true&rdquo; or intimating that the judgments would be decisive for the class where these results seemed appropriate but were reached by dint of depriving the word &ldquo;several&rdquo; of coherent meaning. See, e.g., <em>System Federation No. 91 v. Reed</em>, 180 F.2d 991 (6th Cir. 1950); <em>Wilson v. City of Paducah</em>, 100 F.Supp. 116 (W.D.Ky. 1951); <em>Citizens Banking Co. v. Monticello State Bank</em>, 143 F.2d 261 (8th Cir. 1944); <em>Redmond v. Commerce Trust Co</em>., 144 F.2d 140 (8th Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 776 (1944); <em>United States v. American Optical Co</em>., 97 F.Supp. 66 (N.D.Ill. 1951); <em>National Hairdressers&rsquo; & C. Assn. v. Philad. Co</em>., 34 F.Supp. 264 (D.Del. 1940); 41 F.Supp. 701 (D.Del. 1940), aff'd mem., 129 F.2d 1020 (3d Cir. 1942). Second, we find cases classified by the courts as &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; in which, on a realistic view, it would seem fitting for the judgments to extend to the class. See, e.g., <em>Knapp v. Bankers Sec. Corp</em>., 17 F.R.D. 245 (E.D.Pa. 1954); aff'd 230 F.2d 717 (3d Cir. 1956); <em>Giesecke v. Denver Tramway Corp</em>., 81 F.Supp. 957 (D.Del. 1949); <em>York v. Guaranty Trust Co</em>., 143 F.2d 503 (2d Cir. 1944), rev'd on grounds not here relevant, 326 U.S. 90 (1945) (see Chafee, supra, at 208); cf. <em>Webster Eisenlohr, Inc. v. Kalodner</em>, 145 F.2d 316, 320 (3d Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 325 U.S. 807 (1945). But cf. the early decisions, <em>Duke of Bedford v. Ellis</em> [1901], A.C. 1; <em>Sheffield Waterworks v. Yeomans</em>, L.R. 2 Ch.App. 8 (1866); <em>Brown v. Vermuden</em>, 1 Ch.Cas. 272, 22 Eng.Rep. 796 (1676).</p>
<p class="note-body">The &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; action envisaged by original Rule 23 was in any event an anomaly because, although denominated a &ldquo;class&rdquo; action and pleaded as such, it was supposed not to adjudicate the rights or liabilities of any person not a party. It was believed to be an advantage of the &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; category that it would invite decisions that a member of the &ldquo;class&rdquo; could, like a member of the class in a &ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; action, intervene on an ancillary basis without being required to show an independent basis of Federal jurisdiction, and have the benefit of the date of the commencement of the action for purposes of the statute of limitations. See 3 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, pars. 23.10[1], 23.12 (2d ed. 1963). These results were attained in some instances but not in others. On the statute of limitations, see <em>Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley</em>, 300 F.2d 561 (10th Cir. 1961), pet. cert. dism., 371 U.S. 801 (1963); but cf. <em>P. W. Husserl, Inc. v. Newman</em>, 25 F.R.D. 264 (S.D.N.Y. 1960); <em>Athas v. Day</em>, 161 F.Supp. 916 (D.Colo. 1958). On ancillary intervention, see <em>Amen v. Black</em>, 234 F.2d 12 (10th Cir. 1956), cert. granted, 352 U.S. 888 (1956), dism. on stip., 355 U.S. 600 (1958); but. cf. <em>Wagner v. Kemper</em>, 13 F.R.D. 128 (W.D.Mo. 1952). The results, however, can hardly depend upon the mere appearance of a &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; category in the rule; they should turn no more basic considerations. See discussion of subdivision (c)(1) below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the original rule did not squarely address itself to the question of the measures that might be taken during the course of the action to assure procedural fairness, particularly giving notice to members of the class, which may in turn be related in some instances to the extension of the judgment to the class. See Chafee, supra, at 230&ndash;31; Keeffe, Levy & Donovan, supra; <em>Developments in the Law</em>, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 937&ndash;38; Note, <em>Binding Effect of Class Actions</em>, 67 Harv.L.Rev. 1059, 1062&ndash;65 (1954); Note, <em>Federal Class Actions: A Suggested Revision of Rule 23</em>, 46 Colum.L.Rev. 818, 833&ndash;36 (1946); Mich.Gen.Court R. 208.4 (effective Jan. 1, 1963); Idaho R.Civ.P. 23(d); Minn.R.Civ.P. 23.04; N.Dak.R.Civ.P. 23(d).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>The amended rule</em> describes in more practical terms the occasions for maintaining class actions; provides that all class actions maintained to the end as such will result in judgments including those whom the court finds to be members of the class, whether or not the judgment is favorable to the class; and refers to the measures which can be taken to assure the fair conduct of these actions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> states the prerequisites for maintaining any class action in terms of the numerousness of the class making joinder of the members impracticable, the existence of questions common to the class, and the desired qualifications of the representative parties. See Weinstein, <em>Revision of Procedure; Some Problems in Class Actions</em>, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. 433, 458&ndash;59 (1960); 2 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;562, at 265, &sect;572, at 351&ndash;52 (Wright ed. 1961). These are necessary but not sufficient conditions for a class action. See, e.g., <em>Giordano v. Radio Corp. of Am</em>., 183 F.2d 558, 560 (3d Cir. 1950); <em>Zachman v. Erwin</em>, 186 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.Tex. 1959); <em>Baim & Blank, Inc. v. Warren Connelly Co., Inc</em>., 19 F.R.D. 108 (S.D.N.Y. 1956). Subdivision (b) describes the additional elements which in varying situations justify the use of a class action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)</em>. The difficulties which would be likely to arise if resort were had to separate actions by or against the individual members of the class here furnish the reasons for, and the principal key to, the propriety and value of utilizing the class-action device. The considerations stated under clauses (A) and (B) are comparable to certain of the elements which define the persons whose joinder in an action is desirable as stated in Rule 19(a), as amended. See amended Rule 19(a)(2)(i) and (ii), and the Advisory Committee's Note thereto; Hazard, <em>Indispensable Party; The Historical Origin of a Procedural Phantom</em>, 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1254, 1259&ndash;60 (1961); cf. 3 <em>Moore</em>, supra, par. 23.08, at 3435.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Clause (A)</em>: One person may have rights against, or be under duties toward, numerous persons constituting a class, and be so positioned that conflicting or varying adjudications in lawsuits with individual members of the class might establish incompatible standards to govern his conduct. The class action device can be used effectively to obviate the actual or virtual dilemma which would thus confront the party opposing the class. The matter has been stated thus: &ldquo;The felt necessity for a class action is greatest when the courts are called upon to order or sanction the alteration of the status quo in circumstances such that a large number of persons are in a position to call on a single person to alter the status quo, or to complain if it is altered, and the possibility exists that [the] actor might be called upon to act in inconsistent ways.&rdquo; Louisell & Hazard, <em>Pleading and Procedure; State and Federal</em> 719 (1962); see <em>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble</em>, 255 U.S. 356, 366&ndash;67 (1921). To illustrate: Separate actions by individuals against a municipality to declare a bond issue <!-- PDFPage:137 -->invalid or condition or limit it, to prevent or limit the making of a particular appropriation or to compel or invalidate an assessment, might create a risk of inconsistent or varying determinations. In the same way, individual litigations of the rights and duties of riparian owners, or of landowners&rsquo; rights and duties respecting a claimed nuisance, could create a possibility of incompatible adjudications. Actions by or against a class provide a ready and fair means of achieving unitary adjudication. See <em>Maricopa County Mun. Water Con. Dist. v. Looney</em>, 219 F.2d 529 (9th Cir. 1955); <em>Rank v. Krug</em>, 142 F.Supp. 1, 154&ndash;59 (S.D.Calif. 1956), on app., <em>State of California v. Rank</em>, 293 F.2d 340, 348 (9th Cir. 1961); <em>Gart v. Cole</em>, 263 F.2d 244 (2d Cir. 1959), cert. denied 359 U.S. 978 (1959); cf. <em>Martinez v. Maverick Cty. Water Con. & Imp. Dist</em>., 219 F.2d 666 (5th Cir. 1955); 3 <em>Moore</em>, supra, par. 23.11[2], at 3458&ndash;59.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Clause (B)</em>: This clause takes in situations where the judgment in a nonclass action by or against an individual member of the class, while not technically concluding the other members, might do so as a practical matter. The vice of an individual actions would lie in the fact that the other members of the class, thus practically concluded, would have had no representation in the lawsuit. In an action by policy holders against a fraternal benefit association attacking a financial reorganization of the society, it would hardly have been practical, if indeed it would have been possible, to confine the effects of a validation of the reorganization to the individual plaintiffs. Consequently a class action was called for with adequate representation of all members of the class. See <em>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble</em>, 255 U.S. 356 (1921); <em>Waybright v. Columbian Mut. Life Ins. Co</em>., 30 F.Supp. 885 (W.D.Tenn. 1939); cf. <em>Smith v. Swormstedt</em>, 16 How. (57 U.S.) 288 (1853). For much the same reason actions by shareholders to compel the declaration of a dividend the proper recognition and handling of redemption or pre-emption rights, or the like (or actions by the corporation for corresponding declarations of rights), should ordinarily be conducted as class actions, although the matter has been much obscured by the insistence that each shareholder has an individual claim. See <em>Knapp v. Bankers Securities Corp</em>., 17 F.R.D. 245 (E.D.Pa. 1954), aff'd, 230 F.2d 717 (3d Cir. 1956); <em>Giesecke v. Denver Tramway Corp</em>., 81 F.Supp. 957 (D.Del. 1949); <em>Zahn v. Transamerica Corp</em>., 162 F.2d 36 (3d Cir. 1947); <em>Speed v. Transamerica Corp</em>., 100 F.Supp. 461 (D.Del. 1951); <em>Sobel v. Whittier Corp</em>., 95 F.Supp. 643 (E.D.Mich. 1951), app. dism., 195 F.2d 361 (6th Cir. 1952); <em>Goldberg v. Whittier Corp</em>., 111 F.Supp. 382 (E.D.Mich. 1953); <em>Dann v. Studebaker-Packard Corp</em>., 288 F.2d 201 (6th Cir. 1961); <em>Edgerton v. Armour & Co</em>.,94 F.Supp. 549 (S.D.Calif. 1950); <em>Ames v. Mengel Co</em>., 190 F.2d 344 (2d Cir. 1951). (These shareholders&rsquo; actions are to be distinguished from derivative actions by shareholders dealt with in new Rule 23.1). The same reasoning applies to an action which charges a breach of trust by an indenture trustee or other fiduciary similarly affecting the members of a large class of security holders or other beneficiaries, and which requires an accounting or like measures to restore the subject of the trust. See <em>Bosenberg v. Chicago T. & T. Co</em>., 128 F.2d 245 (7th Cir. 1942); <em>Citizens Banking Co. v. Monticello State Bank</em>, 143 F.2d 261 (8th Cir. 1944); <em>Redmond v. Commerce Trust Co</em>., 144 F.2d 140 (8th Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 776 (1944); cf. <em>York v. Guaranty Trust Co</em>., 143 F.2d 503 (2d Cir. 1944), rev'd on grounds not here relevant, 326 U.S. 99 (1945).</p>
<p class="note-body">In various situations an adjudication as to one or more members of the class will necessarily or probably have an adverse practical effect on the interests of other members who should therefore be represented in the lawsuit. This is plainly the case when claims are made by numerous persons against a fund insufficient to satisfy all claims. A class action by or against representative members to settle the validity of the claims as a whole, or in groups, followed by separate proof of the amount of each valid claim and proportionate distribution of the fund, meets the problem. Cf. <em>Dickinson v. Burnham</em>, 197 F.2d 973 (2d Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 875 (1952); 3 Moore, supra, at par. 23.09. The same reasoning applies to an action by a creditor to set aside a fraudulent conveyance by the debtor and to appropriate the property to his claim, when the debtor's assets are insufficient to pay all creditors&rsquo; claims. See <em>Hefferman v. Bennett & Armour</em>, 110 Cal.App.2d 564, 243 P.2d 846 (1952); cf. <em>City & County of San Francisco v. Market Street Ry</em>., 95 Cal.App.2d 648, 213 P.2d 780 (1950). Similar problems, however, can arise in the absence of a fund either present or potential. A negative or mandatory injunction secured by one of a numerous class may disable the opposing party from performing claimed duties toward the other members of the class or materially affect his ability to do so. An adjudication as to movie &ldquo;clearances and runs&rdquo; nominally affecting only one exhibitor would often have practical effects on all the exhibitors in the same territorial area. Cf. <em>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc</em>., 66 F.Supp. 323, 341&ndash;46 (S.D.N.Y. 1946); 334 U.S. 131, 144&ndash;48 (1948). Assuming a sufficiently numerous class of exhibitors, a class action would be advisable. (Here representation of subclasses of exhibitors could become necessary; see subdivision (c)(3)(B).)</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)</em>. This subdivision is intended to reach situations where a party has taken action or refused to take action with respect to a class, and final relief of an injunctive nature or of a corresponding declaratory nature, settling the legality of the behavior with respect to the class as a whole, is appropriate. Declaratory relief &ldquo;corresponds&rdquo; to injunctive relief when as a practical matter it affords injunctive relief or serves as a basis for later injunctive relief. The subdivision does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages. Action or inaction is directed to a class within the meaning of this subdivision even if it has taken effect or is threatened only as to one or a few members of the class, provided it is based on grounds which have general application to the class.</p>
<p class="note-body">Illustrative are various actions in the civil-rights field where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one whose members are incapable of specific enumeration. See <em>Potts v. Flax</em>, 313 F.2d 284 (5th Cir. 1963); <em>Bailey v. Patterson</em>, 323 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 972 (1964); <em>Brunson v. Board of Trustees of School District No. 1, Clarendon City, S.C</em>., 311 F.2d 107 (4th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 933 (1963); <em>Green v. School Bd. of Roanoke, Va</em>., 304 F.2d 118 (4th Cir. 1962); <em>Orleans Parish School Bd. v. Bush</em>, 242 F.2d 156 (5th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 921 (1957); <em>Mannings v. Board of Public Inst. of Hillsborough County, Fla</em>., 277 F.2d 370 (5th Cir. 1960); <em>Northcross v. Board of Ed. of City of Memphis</em>, 302 F.2d 818 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied 370 U.S. 944 (1962); <em>Frasier v. Board of Trustees of Univ. of N.C</em>., 134 F.Supp. 589 (M.D.N.C. 1955, 3-judge court), aff'd, 350 U.S. 979 (1956). Subdivision (b)(2) is not limited to civil-rights cases. Thus an action looking to specific or declaratory relief could be brought by a numerous class of purchasers, say retailers of a given description, against a seller alleged to have undertaken to sell to that class at prices higher than those set for other purchasers, say retailers of another description, when the applicable law forbids such a pricing differential. So also a patentee of a machine, charged with selling or licensing the machine on condition that purchasers or licensees also purchase or obtain licenses to use an ancillary unpatented machine, could be sued on a class basis by a numerous group of purchasers or licensees, or by a numerous group of competing sellers or licensors of the unpatented machine, to test the legality of the &ldquo;tying&rdquo; condition.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3)</em>. In the situations to which this subdivision relates, class-action treatment is not as clearly called for as in those described above, but it may nevertheless be convenient and desirable depending upon the particular facts. Subdivision (b)(3) encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote, uniformity of decision as to persons similarly <!-- PDFPage:138 -->situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results. Cf. Chafee, supra, at 201.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court is required to find, as a condition of holding that a class action may be maintained under this subdivision, that the questions common to the class predominate over the questions affecting individual members. It is only where this predominance exists that economies can be achieved by means of the class-action device. In this view, a fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action, and it may remain so despite the need, if liability is found, for separate determination of the damages suffered by individuals within the class. On the other hand, although having some common core, a fraud case may be unsuited for treatment as a class action if there was material variation in the representation made or in the kinds or degrees of reliance by the persons to whom they were addressed. See <em>Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young & Co., Inc</em>., 144 F.2d 387 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>Miller v. National City Bank of N.Y</em>., 166 F.2d 723 (2d Cir. 1948); and for like problems in other contexts, see <em>Hughes v. Encyclopaedia Brittanica</em>, 199 F.2d 295 (7th Cir. 1952); <em>Sturgeon v. Great Lakes Steel Corp</em>., 143 F.2d 819 (6th Cir. 1944). A &ldquo;mass accident&rdquo; resulting in injuries to numerous persons is ordinarily not appropriate for a class action because of the likelihood that significant questions, not only of damages but of liability and defenses of liability, would be present, affecting the individuals in different ways. In these circumstances an action conducted nominally as a class action would degenerate in practice into multiple lawsuits separately tried. See <em>Pennsylvania R.R. v. United States</em>, 111 F.Supp. 80 (D.N.J. 1953); cf. Weinstein, supra, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. at 469. Private damage claims by numerous individuals arising out of concerted antitrust violations may or may not involve predominating common questions. See <em>Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley</em>, 300 F.2d 561 (10th Cir. 1961), pet. cert. dism., 371 U.S. 801 (1963); cf. <em>Weeks v. Bareco Oil Co</em>., 125 F.2d 84 (7th Cir. 1941); <em>Kainz v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc</em>., 194 F.2d 737 (7th Cir. 1952); <em>Hess v. Anderson, Clayton & Co</em>., 20 F.R.D. 466 (S.D.Calif. 1957).</p>
<p class="note-body">That common questions predominate is not itself sufficient to justify a class action under subdivision (b)(3), for another method of handling the litigious situation may be available which has greater practical advantages. Thus one or more actions agreed to by the parties as test or model actions may be preferable to a class action; or it may prove feasible and preferable to consolidate actions. Cf. Weinstein, supra, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. at 438&ndash;54. Even when a number of separate actions are proceeding simultaneously, experience shows that the burdens on the parties and the courts can sometimes be reduced by arrangements for avoiding repetitious discovery or the like. Currently the Coordinating Committee on Multiple Litigation in the United States District Courts (a subcommittee of the Committee on Trial Practice and Technique of the Judicial Conference of the United States) is charged with developing methods for expediting such massive litigation. To reinforce the point that the court with the aid of the parties ought to assess the relative advantages of alternative procedures for handling the total controversy, subdivision (b)(3) requires, as a further condition of maintaining the class action, that the court shall find that that procedure is &ldquo;superior&rdquo; to the others in the particular circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Factors (A)&ndash;(D) are listed, non-exhaustively, as pertinent to the findings. The court is to consider the interests of individual members of the class in controlling their own litigations and carrying them on as they see fit. See <em>Weeks v. Bareco Oil Co</em>., 125 F.2d 84, 88&ndash;90, 93&ndash;94 (7th Cir. 1941) (anti-trust action); see also <em>Pentland v. Dravo Corp</em>., 152 F.2d 851 (3d Cir. 1945), and Chaffee, supra, at 273&ndash;75, regarding policy of Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, &sect;16(b), 29 U.S.C. &sect;216(b), prior to amendment by Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, &sect;5(a). [The present provisions of 29 U.S.C. &sect;216(b) are not intended to be affected by Rule 23, as amended.]</p>
<p class="note-body">In this connection the court should inform itself of any litigation actually pending by or against the individuals. The interests of individuals in conducting separate lawsuits may be so strong as to call for denial of a class action. On the other hand, these interests may be theoretic rather than practical; the class may have a high degree of cohesion and prosecution of the action through representatives would be quite unobjectionable, or the amounts at stake for individuals may be so small that separate suits would be impracticable. The burden that separate suits would impose on the party opposing the class, or upon the court calendars, may also fairly be considered. (See the discussion, under subdivision (c)(2) below, of the right of members to be excluded from the class upon their request.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Also pertinent is the question of the desirability of concentrating the trial of the claims in the particular forum by means of a class action, in contrast to allowing the claims to be litigated separately in forums to which they would ordinarily be brought. Finally, the court should consider the problems of management which are likely to arise in the conduct of a class action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(1)</em>. In order to give clear definition to the action, this provision requires the court to determine, as early in the proceedings as may be practicable, whether an action brought as a class action is to be so maintained. The determination depends in each case on satisfaction of the terms of subdivision (a) and the relevant provisions of subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">An order embodying a determination can be conditional; the court may rule, for example, that a class action may be maintained only if the representation is improved through intervention of additional parties of a stated type. A determination once made can be altered or amended before the decision on the merits if, upon fuller development of the facts, the original determination appears unsound. A negative determination means that the action should be stripped of its character as a class action. See subdivision (d)(4). Although an action thus becomes a nonclass action, the court may still be receptive to interventions before the decision on the merits so that the litigation may cover as many interests as can be conveniently handled; the questions whether the intervenors in the nonclass action shall be permitted to claim &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; jurisdiction or the benefit of the date of the commencement of the action for purposes of the statute of limitations are to be decided by reference to the laws governing jurisdiction and limitations as they apply in particular contexts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Whether the court should require notice to be given to members of the class of its intention to make a determination, or of the order embodying it, is left to the court's discretion under subdivision (d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(2)</em> makes special provision for class actions maintained under subdivision (b)(3). As noted in the discussion of the latter subdivision, the interests of the individuals in pursuing their own litigations may be so strong here as to warrant denial of a class action altogether. Even when a class action is maintained under subdivision (b)(3), this individual interest is respected. Thus the court is required to direct notice to the members of the class of the right of each member to be excluded from the class upon his request. A member who does not request exclusion may, if he wishes, enter an appearance in the action through his counsel; whether or not he does so, the judgment in the action will embrace him.</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice setting forth the alternatives open to the members of the class, is to be the best practicable under the circumstances, and shall include individual notice to the members who can be identified through reasonable effort. (For further discussion of this notice, see the statement under subdivision (d)(2) below.)</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(3)</em>. The judgment in a class action maintained as such to the end will embrace the class, that is, in a class action under subdivision (b)(1) or (b)(2), those found by the court to be class members; in a class action under subdivision (b)(3), those to whom <!-- PDFPage:139 -->the notice prescribed by subdivision (c)(2) was directed, excepting those who requested exclusion or who are ultimately found by the court not to be members of the class. The judgment has this scope whether it is favorable or unfavorable to the class. In a (b)(1) or (b)(2) action the judgment &ldquo;describes&rdquo; the members of the class, but need not specify the individual members; in a (b)(3) action the judgment &ldquo;specifies&rdquo; the individual members who have been identified and described the others.</p>
<p class="note-body">Compare subdivision (c)(4) as to actions conducted as class actions only with respect to particular issues. Where the class-action character of the lawsuit is based solely on the existence of a &ldquo;limited fund,&rdquo; the judgment, while extending to all claims of class members against the fund, has ordinarily left unaffected the personal claims of nonappearing members against the debtor. See 3 Moore, supra, par. 23.11[4].</p>
<p class="note-body">Hitherto, in a few actions conducted as &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; class actions and thus nominally designed to extend only to parties and others intervening <em>before</em> the determination of liability, courts have held or intimated that class members might be permitted to intervene <em>after</em> a decision on the merits favorable to their interests, in order to secure the benefits of the decision for themselves, although they would presumably be unaffected by an unfavorable decision. See, as to the propriety of this so-called &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; intervention in &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; actions, the conflicting views expressed in <em>Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley</em>, 300 F.2d 561 (10th Cir. 1961), pet. cert. dism., 371 U.S. 801 (1963); <em>York v. Guaranty Trust Co</em>., 143 F.2d 503, 529 (2d Cir. 1944), rev'd on grounds not here relevant, 326 U.S. 99 (1945); <em>Pentland v. Dravo Corp</em>., 152 F.2d 851, 856 (3d Cir. 1945); <em>Speed v. Transamerica Corp</em>., 100 F.Supp. 461, 463 (D.Del. 1951); <em>State Wholesale Grocers v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co</em>., 24 F.R.D. 510 (N.D.Ill. 1959); <em>Alabama Ind. Serv. Stat. Assn. v. Shell Pet Corp</em>., 28 F.Supp. 386, 390 (N.D.Ala. 1939); <em>Tolliver v. Cudahy Packing Co</em>., 39 F.Supp. 337, 339 (E.D.Tenn. 1941); Kalven & Rosenfield, supra, 8 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 684 (1941); Comment, 53 Nw.U.L.Rev. 627, 632&ndash;33 (1958); Developments in the Law, supra, 71 Harv.L.Rev. at 935; 2 Barron & Holtzoff, supra, &sect;568; but cf. <em>Lockwood v. Hercules Powder Co</em>., 7 F.R.D. 24, 28&ndash;29 (W.D.Mo. 1947); <em>Abram v. San Joaquin Cotton Oil Co</em>., 46 F.Supp. 969, 976&ndash;77 (S.D.Calif. 1942); Chaffee, supra, at 280, 285; 3 <em>Moore</em>, supra, par. 23.12, at 3476. Under proposed subdivision (c)(3), one-way intervention is excluded; the action will have been early determined to be a class or nonclass action, and in the former case the judgment, whether or not favorable, will include the class, as above stated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although thus declaring that the judgment in a class action includes the class, as defined, subdivision (c)(3) does not disturb the recognized principle that the court conducting the action cannot predetermine the <em>res judicata</em> effect of the judgment; this can be tested only in a subsequent action. See Restatement, <em>Judgments</em> &sect;86, comment (h), &sect;116 (1942). The court, however, in framing the judgment in any suit brought as a class action, must decide what its extent or coverage shall be, and if the matter is carefully considered, questions of <em>res judicata</em> are less likely to be raised at a later time and if raised will be more satisfactorily answered. See Chafee, supra, at 294; Weinstein, supra, 9 Buffalo L.Rev. at 460.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(4)</em>. This provision recognizes that an action may be maintained as a class action as to particular issues only. For example, in a fraud or similar case the action may retain its &ldquo;class&rdquo; character only through the adjudication of liability to the class; the members of the class may thereafter be required to come in individually and prove the amounts of their respective claims.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two or more classes may be represented in a single action. Where a class is found to include subclasses divergent in interest, the class may be divided correspondingly, and each subclass treated as a class.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is concerned with the fair and efficient conduct of the action and lists some types of orders which may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court should consider how the proceedings are to be arranged in sequence, and what measures should be taken to simplify the proof and argument. See subdivision (d)(1). The orders resulting from this consideration, like the others referred to in subdivision (d), may be combined with a pretrial order under Rule 16, and are subject to modification as the case proceeds.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(2) sets out a non-exhaustive list of possible occasions for orders requiring notice to the class. Such notice is not a novel conception. For example, in &ldquo;limited fund&rdquo; cases, members of the class have been notified to present individual claims after the basic class decision. Notice has gone to members of a class so that they might express any opposition to the representation, see <em>United States v. American Optical Co</em>., 97 F.Supp. 66 (N.D.Ill. 1951), and 1950&ndash;51 CCH Trade Cases 64573&ndash;74 (par. 62869); cf. <em>Weeks v. Bareco Oil Co</em>., 125 F.2d 84, 94 (7th Cir. 1941), and notice may encourage interventions to improve the representation of the class. Cf. <em>Oppenheimer v. F. J. Young & Co</em>., 144 F.2d 387 (2d Cir. 1944). Notice has been used to poll members on a proposed modification of a consent decree. See record in <em>Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States</em>, 366 U.S. 683 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(2) does not require notice at any stage, but rather calls attention to its availability and invokes the court's discretion. In the degree that there is cohesiveness or unity in the class and the representation is effective, the need for notice to the class will tend toward a minimum. These indicators suggest that notice under subdivision (d)(2) may be particularly useful and advisable in certain class actions maintained under subdivision (b)(3), for example, to permit members of the class to object to the representation. Indeed, under subdivision (c)(2), notice must be ordered, and is not merely discretionary, to give the members in a subdivision (b)(3) class action an opportunity to secure exclusion from the class. This mandatory notice pursuant to subdivision (c)(2), together with any discretionary notice which the court may find it advisable to give under subdivision (d)(2), is designed to fulfill requirements of due process to which the class action procedure is of course subject. See <em>Hansberry v. Lee</em>, 311 U.S. 32 (1940); <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co</em>., 339 U.S. 306 (1950); cf. <em>Dickinson v. Burnham</em>, 197 F.2d 973, 979 (2d Cir. 1952), and studies cited at 979 n. 4; see also <em>All American Airways, Inc. v. Elderd</em>, 209 F.2d 247, 249 (2d Cir. 1954); <em>Gart v. Cole</em>, 263 F.2d 244, 248&ndash;49 (2d Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 978 (1959).</p>
<p class="note-body">Notice to members of the class, whenever employed under amended Rule 23, should be accommodated to the particular purpose but need not comply with the formalities for service of process. See Chafee, supra, at 230&ndash;31; <em>Brendle v. Smith</em>, 7 F.R.D. 119 (S.D.N.Y. 1946). The fact that notice is given at one stage of the action does not mean that it must be given at subsequent stages. Notice is available fundamentally &ldquo;for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action&rdquo; and should not be used merely as a device for the undesirable solicitation of claims. See the discussion in <em>Cherner v. Transitron Electronic Corp</em>., 201 F.Supp. 934 (D.Mass. 1962); <em>Hormel v. United States</em>, 17 F.R.D. 303 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).</p>
<p class="note-body">In appropriate cases the court should notify interested government agencies of the pendency of the action or of particular steps therein.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(3) reflects the possibility of conditioning the maintenance of a class action, e.g., on the strengthening of the representation, see subdivision (c)(1) above; and recognizes that the imposition of conditions on intervenors may be required for the proper and efficient conduct of the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to orders under subdivision (d)(4), see subdivision (c)(1) above.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) requires approval of the court, after notice, for the dismissal or compromise of any class action.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. This permissive interlocutory appeal provision is adopted under the power conferred by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(e). Appeal from an order granting or denying class certification is permitted in the sole discretion of the court of appeals. No other type of Rule 23 order is covered by this provision. The court of appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal, akin to the discretion exercised by the Supreme Court in acting on a petition for certiorari. This discretion suggests an analogy to the provision in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b) for permissive appeal on certification by a district court. Subdivision (f), however, departs from the &sect;1292(b) model in two significant ways. It does not require that the district court certify the certification ruling for appeal, although the district court often can assist the parties and court of appeals by offering advice on the desirability of appeal. And it does not include the potentially limiting requirements of &sect;1292(b) that the district court order &ldquo;involve[] a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The courts of appeals will develop standards for granting review that reflect the changing areas of uncertainty in class litigation. The Federal Judicial Center study supports the view that many suits with class-action allegations present familiar and almost routine issues that are no more worthy of immediate appeal than many other interlocutory rulings. Yet several concerns justify expansion of present opportunities to appeal. An order denying certification may confront the plaintiff with a situation in which the only sure path to appellate review is by proceeding to final judgment on the merits of an individual claim that, standing alone, is far smaller than the costs of litigation. An order granting certification, on the other hand, may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability. These concerns can be met at low cost by establishing in the court of appeals a discretionary power to grant interlocutory review in cases that show appeal-worthy certification issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">Permission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive. Permission is most likely to be granted when the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law, or when, as a practical matter, the decision on certification is likely dispositive of the litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The district court, having worked through the certification decision, often will be able to provide cogent advice on the factors that bear on the decision whether to permit appeal. This advice can be particularly valuable if the certification decision is tentative. Even as to a firm certification decision, a statement of reasons bearing on the probable benefits and costs of immediate appeal can help focus the court of appeals decision, and may persuade the disappointed party that an attempt to appeal would be fruitless.</p>
<p class="note-body">The 10-day period for seeking permission to appeal is designed to reduce the risk that attempted appeals will disrupt continuing proceedings. It is expected that the courts of appeals will act quickly in making the preliminary determination whether to permit appeal. Permission to appeal does not stay trial court proceedings. A stay should be sought first from the trial court. If the trial court refuses a stay, its action and any explanation of its views should weigh heavily with the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">Appellate Rule 5 has been modified to establish the procedure for petitioning for leave to appeal under subdivision (f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made after Publication (GAP Report)</em>. No changes were made in the text of Rule 23(f) as published.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several changes were made in the published Committee Note. (1) References to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1292(b) interlocutory appeals were revised to dispel any implication that the restrictive elements of &sect;1292(b) should be read in to Rule 23(f). New emphasis was placed on court of appeals discretion by making explicit the analogy to certiorari discretion. (2) Suggestions that the new procedure is a &ldquo;modest&rdquo; expansion of appeal opportunities, to be applied with &ldquo;restraint,&rdquo; and that permission &ldquo;almost always will be denied when the certification decision turns on case-specific matters of fact and district court discretion,&rdquo; were deleted. It was thought better simply to observe that courts of appeals will develop standards &ldquo;that reflect the changing areas of uncertainty in class litigation.&rdquo;</p>

The complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for the plaintiff's failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Intervention of Right</cap-smallcap>. Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Permissive Intervention</cap-smallcap>. Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. When a party to an action relies for ground of claim or defense upon any statute or executive order administered by a federal or state governmental officer or agency or upon any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made pursuant to the statute or executive order, the officer or agency upon timely application may be permitted to intervene in the action. In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedure</cap-smallcap>. A person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion to intervene upon the parties as provided in Rule 5. The motion shall state the grounds therefor and shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought. The same procedure shall be followed when a statute of the United States gives a right to intervene. When the constitutionality of an act of Congress affecting the public interest is drawn in question in any action in which the United States or an officer, agency, or employee thereof is not a party, the court shall notify the Attorney General of the United States as provided in Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;2403. When the constitutionality of any statute of a State affecting the public interest is drawn in question in any action in which that State or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is not a party, the court shall notify the attorney general of the State as provided in Title 28, U.S.C. &sect;2403. A party challenging the constitutionality of legislation should call the attention of the court to its consequential duty, but failure to do so is not a waiver of any constitutional right otherwise timely asserted.</p>

<p class="note-body">Compare with the last sentence of [former] Equity Rule 37 (Parties Generally&mdash;Intervention). This rule amplifies and restates the present federal practice at law and in equity.

See generally Moore and Levi, <em>Federal Intervention: I The Right to Intervene and Reorganization</em> (1936), 45 Yale L.J. 565. Under the codes two types of intervention are provided, one for the recovery of specific real or personal property (2 Ohio Gen.Code Ann. (Page, 1926) &sect;11263; Wyo.Rev.Stat.Ann.

The addition to subdivision (a)(3) covers the situation where property may be in the ac<!-- PDFPage:142 -->tual custody of some other officer or agency&mdash;such as the Secretary of the Treasury&mdash;but the control and disposition of the property is lodged in the court wherein the action is pending.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment conforms to the amendment of Rule 5(a). See the Advisory Committee's Note to that amendment.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In attempting to overcome certain difficulties which have arisen in the application of present Rule 24(a)(2) and (3), this amendment draws upon the revision of the related Rules 19 (joinder of persons needed for just adjudication) and 23 (class actions), and the reasoning underlying that revision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 24(a)(3) as amended in 1948 provided for intervention of right where the applicant established that he would be adversely affected by the distribution or disposition of property involved in an action to which he had not been made a party. Significantly, some decided cases virtually disregarded the language of this provision. Thus Professor Moore states: &ldquo;The concept of a fund has been applied so loosely that it is possible for a court to find a fund in almost any in personam action.&rdquo; 4 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em>, par. 24.09[3], at 55 (2d ed. 1962), and see, e.g., <em>Formulabs, Inc. v. Hartley Pen Co</em>., 275 F.2d 52 (9th Cir. 1960). This development was quite natural, for Rule 24(a)(3) was unduly restricted. If an absentee would be substantially affected in a practical sense by the determination made in an action, he should, as a general rule, be entitled to intervene, and his right to do so should not depend on whether there is a fund to be distributed or otherwise disposed of. Intervention of right is here seen to be a kind of counterpart to Rule 19(a)(2)(i) on joinder of persons needed for a just adjudication: where, upon motion of a party in an action, an absentee should be joined so that he may protect his interest which as a practical matter may be substantially impaired by the disposition of the action, he ought to have a right to intervene in the action on his own motion. See Louisell & Hazard, <em>Pleading and Procedure: State and Federal</em> 749&ndash;50 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">The general purpose of original Rule 24(a)(2) was to entitle an absentee, purportedly represented by a party, to intervene in the action if he could establish with fair probability that the representation was inadequate. Thus, where an action is being prosecuted or defended by a trustee, a beneficiary of the trust should have a right to intervene if he can show that the trustee's representation of his interest probably is inadequate; similarly a member of a class should have the right to intervene in a class action if he can show the inadequacy of the representation of his interest by the representative parties before the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Original Rule 24(a)(2), however, made it a condition of intervention that &ldquo;the applicant is or may be bound by a judgment in the action,&rdquo; and this created difficulties with intervention in class actions. If the &ldquo;bound&rdquo; language was read literally in the sense of res judicata, it could defeat intervention in some meritorious cases. A member of a class to whom a judgment in a class action extended by its terms (see Rule 23(c)(3), as amended) might be entitled to show in a later action, when the judgment in the class action was claimed to operate as res judicata against him, that the &ldquo;representative&rdquo; in the class action had not in fact adequately represented him. If he could make this showing, the class-action judgment might be held not to bind him. See <em>Hansberry v. Lee</em>, 311 U.S. 32 (1940). If a class member sought to intervene in the class action proper, while it was still pending, on grounds of inadequacy of representation, he could be met with the argument: if the representation was in fact inadequate, he would not be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; by the judgment when it was subsequently asserted against him as res judicata, hence he was not entitled to intervene; if the representation was in fact adequate, there was no occasion or ground for intervention. See <em>Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States</em>, 366 U.S. 683 (1961); cf. <em>Sutphen Estates, Inc. v. United States</em>, 342 U.S. 19 (1951). This reasoning might be linguistically justified by original Rule 24(a)(2); but it could lead to poor results. Compare the discussion in <em>International M. & I. Corp. v. Von Clemm</em>, 301 F.2d 857 (2d Cir. 1962); <em>Atlantic Refining Co. v. Standard Oil Co</em>., 304 F.2d 387 (D.C.Cir. 1962). A class member who claims that his &ldquo;representative&rdquo; does not adequately represent him, and is able to establish that proposition with sufficient probability, should not be put to the risk of having a judgment entered in the action which by its terms extends to him, and be obliged to test the validity of the judgment as applied to his interest by a later collateral attack. Rather he should, as a general rule, be entitled to intervene in the action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that an applicant is entitled to intervene in an action when his position is comparable to that of a person under Rule 19(a)(2)(i), as amended, unless his interest is already adequately represented in the action by existing parties. The Rule 19(a)(2)(i) criterion imports practical considerations, and the deletion of the &ldquo;bound&rdquo; language similarly frees the rule from undue preoccupation with strict considerations of res judicata.</p>
<p class="note-body">The representation whose adequacy comes into question under the amended rule is not confined to formal representation like that provided by a trustee for his beneficiary or a representative party in a class action for a member of the class. A party to an action may provide practical representation to the absentee seeking intervention although no such formal relationship exists between them, and the adequacy of this practical representation will then have to be weighed. See <em>International M. & I. Corp. v. Von Clemm</em>, and <em>Atlantic Refining Co. v. Standard Oil Co</em>., both supra; <em>Wolpe v. Poretsky</em>, 144 F.2d 505 (D.C.Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 777 (1944); cf. <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Bisanz Bros</em>., 249 F.2d 22 (8th Cir. 1957); and generally, Annot., 84 A.L.R.2d 1412 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">An intervention of right under the amended rule may be subject to appropriate conditions or restrictions responsive among other things to the requirements of efficient conduct of the proceedings.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Language is added to bring Rule 24(c) into conformity with the statute cited, resolving some confusion reflected in district court rules. As the text provides, counsel challenging the constitutionality of legislation in an action in which the appropriate government is not a party should call the attention of the court to its duty to notify the appropriate governmental officers. The statute imposes the burden of notification on the court, not the party making the constitutional challenge, partly in order to protect against any possible waiver of constitutional rights by parties inattentive to the need for notice. For this reason, the failure of a party to call the court's attention to the matter cannot be treated as a waiver.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Death.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the successors or representatives of the deceased party and, together with the notice of hearing, shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and upon persons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 4 for the service of a summons, and may be served in any judicial district. Unless the motion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death as provided herein for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the event of the death of one or more of the plaintiffs or of one or more of the defendants in an action in which the right sought to be enforced survives only to the surviving plaintiffs or only against the surviving defendants, the action does not abate. The death shall be suggested upon the record and the action shall proceed in favor of or against the surviving parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Incompetency</cap-smallcap>. If a party becomes incompetent, the court upon motion served as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule may allow the action to be continued by or against the party's representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Interest</cap-smallcap>. In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. Service of the motion shall be made as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Public Officers; Death or Separation From Office.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) When a public officer is a party to an action in his official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action does not abate and the officer's successor is automatically substituted as a party. Proceedings following the substitution shall be in the name of the substituted party, but any misnomer not affecting the substantial rights of the parties shall be disregarded. An order of substitution may be entered at any time, but the omission to enter such an order shall not affect the substitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A public officer who sues or is sued in an official capacity may be described as a party by the officer's official title rather than by name; but the court may require the officer's name to be added.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1937</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (a)</em>. 1. The first paragraph of this rule is based upon [former] Equity Rule 45 (Death of Party&mdash;Revivor) and U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;778 (Death of parties; substitution of executor or administrator). The <em>scire facias</em> procedure provided for in the statute cited is superseded and the writ is abolished by Rule 81 (b). Paragraph two states the content of U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;779 (Death of one of several plaintiffs or defendants). With these two paragraphs compare generally English Rules Under the Judicature Act (The Annual Practice, 1937) O. 17, r.r. 1&ndash;10.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This rule modifies U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;778 (Death of parties; substitution of executor or administrator), 779 (Death of one of several plaintiffs or defendants), and 780 (Survival of actions, suits, or proceedings, etc.) insofar as they differ from it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions (b) and (c)</em>. These are a combination and adaptation of N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;83 and Calif.Code Civ.Proc. (Deering, 1937) &sect;385; see also 4 Nev.Comp.Laws (Hillyer, 1929) &sect;8561.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision (d)</em>. With the first and last sentences compare U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;780 (Survival of actions, suits, or proceedings, etc.). With the second sentence of this subdivision compare <em>Ex parte La Prade</em>, 289 U.S. 444 (1933).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 941, U.S.C. Title 28, &sect;780, is repealed and not included in revised Title 28, for the stated reason that it is &ldquo;Superseded by Rules 25 and 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&rdquo; See Report from the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, to Accompany H.R. 3214, House Rept. 308 (80th Cong., 1st Sess.), p. A239. Those officers which that Act specified but which were not enumerated in Rule 25(d), namely, officers of &ldquo;the Canal Zone, or of a Territory or an insular possession of the United States, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or other governmental agency of such Territory or insular possession,&rdquo; should now be specifically enumerated in the rule and the amendment so provides.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1961 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(1)</em>. Present Rule 25(d) is generally considered to be unsatisfactory. 4 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;25.01[7] (2d ed. 1950); Wright, <em>Amendments to the Federal Rules: The Function of a Continuing Rules Committee</em>, 7 Vand.L.Rev. 521, 529 (1954); <em>Developments in the Law&mdash;Remedies Against the United States and Its Officials</em>, 70 Harv.L.Rev. 827, 931&ndash;34 (1957). To require, as a condition of substituting a successor public officer as a party to a pending action, that an application be made with a showing that there is substantial need for continuing the litigation, can rarely serve any useful purpose and fosters a burdensome formality. And to prescribe a short, fixed time period for substitution which cannot be extended even by agreement, see <em>Snyder v. Buck</em>, 340 U.S. 15, 19 (1950), with the penalty of dismissal of the action, &ldquo;makes a trap for unsuspecting litigants which seems unworthy of a great government.&rdquo; <em>Vibra Brush <!-- PDFPage:144 -->Corp. v. Schaffer</em>, 256 F.2d 681, 684 (2d Cir. 1958). Although courts have on occasion found means of undercutting the rule, <em>e.g. Acheson v. Furusho</em>, 212 F.2d 284 (9th Cir. 1954) (substitution of defendant officer unnecessary on theory that only a declaration of status was sought), it has operated harshly in many instances, <em>e.g. Snyder v. Buck, supra; Poindexter v. Folsom</em>, 242 F.2d 516 (3d Cir. 1957).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment, the successor is automatically substituted as a party without an application or showing of need to continue the action. An order of substitution is not required, but may be entered at any time if a party desires or the court thinks fit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The general term &ldquo;public officer&rdquo; is used in preference to the enumeration which appears in the present rule. It comprises Federal, State, and local officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The expression &ldquo;in his official capacity&rdquo; is to be interpreted in its context as part of a simple procedural rule for substitution; care should be taken not to distort its meaning by mistaken analogies to the doctrine of sovereign immunity from suit or the Eleventh Amendment. The amended rule will apply to all actions brought by public officers for the government, and to any action brought in form against a named officer, but intrinsically against the government or the office or the incumbent thereof whoever he may be from time to time during the action. Thus the amended rule will apply to actions against officers to compel performance of official duties or to obtain judicial review of their orders. It will also apply to actions to prevent officers from acting in excess of their authority or under authority not validly conferred, <em>cf. Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson</em>, 223 U.S. 605 (1912), or from enforcing unconstitutional enactments, <em>cf. Ex parte Young</em>, 209 U.S. 123 (1908); <em>Ex parte La Prade</em>, 289 U.S. 444 (1933). In general it will apply whenever effective relief would call for corrective behavior by the one then having official status and power, rather than one who has lost that status and power through ceasing to hold office. <em>Cf. Land v. Dollar</em>, 330 U.S. 731 (1947); <em>Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp</em>., 337 U.S. 682 (1949). Excluded from the operation of the amended rule will be the relatively infrequent actions which are directed to securing money judgments against the named officers enforceable against their personal assets; in these cases Rule 25(a)(1), not Rule 25(d), applies to the question of substitution. Examples are actions against officers seeking to make them pay damages out of their own pockets for defamatory utterances or other misconduct in some way related to the office, see <em>Barr v. Matteo</em>, 360 U.S. 564 (1959); <em>Howard v. Lyons</em>, 360 U.S. 593 (1959); <em>Gregoire v. Biddle</em>, 177 F.2d 579 (2d Cir. 1949), <em>cert. denied</em>, 339 U.S. 949 (1950). Another example is the anomalous action for a tax refund against a collector of internal revenue, see <em>Ignelzi v. Granger</em>, 16 F.R.D. 517 (W.D.Pa. 1955), 28 U.S.C. &sect;2006, 4 Moore, <em>supra</em>, &nbsp;25.05, p. 531; but see 28 U.S.C. &sect;1346(a)(1), authorizing the bringing of such suits against the United States rather than the officer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Automatic substitution under the amended rule, being merely a procedural device for substituting a successor for a past officeholder as a party, is distinct from and does not affect any substantive issues which may be involved in the action. Thus a defense of immunity from suit will remain in the case despite a substitution.</p>
<p class="note-body">Where the successor does not intend to pursue the policy of his predecessor which gave rise to the lawsuit, it will be open to him, after substitution, as plaintiff to seek voluntary dismissal of the action, or as defendant to seek to have the action dismissed as moot or to take other appropriate steps to avert a judgment or decree. Contrast <em>Ex parte La Prade, supra; Allen v. Regents of the University System</em>, 304 U.S. 439 (1938); <em>McGrath v. National Assn. of Mfgrs</em>., 344 U.S. 804 (1952); <em>Danenberg v. Cohen</em>, 213 F.2d 944 (7th Cir. 1954).</p>
<p class="note-body">As the present amendment of Rule 25(d)(1) eliminates a specified time period to secure substitution of public officers, the reference in Rule 6(b) (regarding enlargement of time) to Rule 25 will no longer apply to these public-officer substitutions.</p>
<p class="note-body">As to substitution on appeal, the rules of the appellate courts should be consulted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(2)</em>. This provision, applicable in &ldquo;official capacity&rdquo; cases as described above, will encourage the use of the official title without any mention of the officer individually, thereby recognizing the intrinsic character of the action and helping to eliminate concern with the problem of substitution. If for any reason it seems necessary or desirable to add the individual's name, this may be done upon motion or on the court's initiative without dismissal of the action; thereafter the procedure of amended Rule 25(d)(1) will apply if the individual named ceases to hold office.</p>
<p class="note-body">For examples of naming the office or title rather than the officeholder, see Annot., 102 A.L.R. 943, 948&ndash;52; Comment, 50 Mich.L.Rev. 443, 450 (1952); <em>cf</em>. 26 U.S.C. &sect;7484. Where an action is brought by or against a board or agency with continuity of existence, it has been often decided that there is no need to name the individual members and substitution is unnecessary when the personnel changes. 4 Moore, <em>supra</em>, &nbsp;25.09, p. 536. The practice encouraged by amended Rule 25(d)(2) is similar.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1963 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Present Rule 25(a)(1), together with present Rule 6(b), results in an inflexible requirement that an action be dismissed as to a deceased party if substitution is not carried out within a fixed period measured from the time of the death. The hardships and inequities of this unyielding requirement plainly appear from the cases. See <em>e.g., Anderson v. Yungkau</em>, 329 U.S. 482, 67 S.Ct. 428, 91 L.Ed. 436 (1947); <em>Iovino v. Waterson</em>, 274 F.2d 41 (1959), <em>cert. denied, Carlin v. Sovino</em>, 362 U.S. 949, 80 S.Ct. 860, 4 L.Ed.2d 867 (1960); <em>Perry v. Allen</em>, 239 F.2d 107 (5th Cir. 1956); <em>Starnes v. Pennsylvania R.R</em>., 26 F.R.D. 625 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd per curiam</em>, 295 F.2d 704 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 813, 82 S.Ct. 688, 7 L.Ed.2d 612 (1962); <em>Zdanok v. Glidden Co</em>., 28 F.R.D. 346 (S.D.N.Y. 1961). See also 4 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;25.01[9] (Supp. 1960); 2 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice & Procedure</em> &sect;621, at 420&ndash;21 (Wright ed. 1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule establishes a time limit for the motion to substitute based not upon the time of the death, but rather upon the time information of the death as provided by the means of a suggestion of death upon the record, i.e., service of a statement of the fact of the death. Cf. Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 110, &sect;54(2) (Smith-Hurd 1956). The motion may not be made later than 90 days after the service of the statement unless the period is extended pursuant to Rule 6(b), as amended. See the Advisory Committee's Note to amended Rule 6(b). See also the new Official Form 30.</p>
<p class="note-body">A motion to substitute may be made by any party or by the representative of the deceased party without awaiting the suggestion of death. Indeed, the motion will usually be so made. If a party or the representative of the deceased party desires to limit the time within which another may make the motion, he may do so by suggesting the death upon the record.</p>
<p class="note-body">A motion to substitute made within the prescribed time will ordinarily be granted, but under the permissive language of the first sentence of the amended rule (&ldquo;the court may order&rdquo;) it may be denied by the court in the exercise of a sound discretion if made long after the death&mdash;as can occur if the suggestion of death is not made or is delayed&mdash;and circumstances have arisen rendering it unfair to allow substitution. Cf. <em>Anderson v. Yungkau</em>, supra, 329 U.S. at 485, 486, 67 S.Ct. at 430, 431, 91 L.Ed. 436, where it was noted under the present rule that settlement and distribution of the state of a deceased defendant might be so far advanced as to warrant denial of a motion for substitution even though made within the time limit prescribed by that rule. Accordingly, a party interested in securing substitution under the amended rule should not assume that he can rest indefinitely awaiting the suggestion of death before he makes his motion to substitute.</p>
