<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Rules.</strong> The United States Court of Federal Claims, acting by a majority of its judges, may, after giving appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment, make and amend rules governing its practice. Such rules, to the extent permitted by this court's jurisdiction, shall be consistent with the FRCP and shall conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A rule takes effect on the date specified by the court and remains in effect unless amended by the court. Copies of rules and amendments shall be made available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedures When There Is No Controlling Law.</strong> A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law or rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2072, or 2503(b). No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or these rules, unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 83 is modeled after FRCP 83. The rule recognizes the court's rule-making authority as set forth at 28 U.S.C. &sect;2503, as well as the assigned judge's authority to regulate practice in an individual case, so long as that practice is consistent with federal law and rules.</p>
