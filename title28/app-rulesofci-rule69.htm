<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure.</em> A money judgment is enforced by a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise. The procedure on execution&mdash;and in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of judgment or execution&mdash;must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located, but a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Obtaining Discovery.</em> In aid of the judgment or execution, the judgment creditor or a successor in interest whose interest appears of record may obtain discovery from any person&mdash;including the judgment debtor&mdash;as provided in these rules or by the procedure of the state where the court is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Against Certain Public Officers.</cap-smallcap> When a judgment has been entered against a revenue officer in the circumstances stated in 28 U.S.C. &sect;2006, or against an officer of Congress in the circumstances stated in 2 U.S.C. &sect;118, the judgment must be satisfied as those statutes provide.</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment substitutes the present statutory reference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1970 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment assures that, in aid of execution on a judgment, all discovery procedures provided in the rules are available and not just discovery via the taking of a deposition. Under the present language, one court has held that Rule 34 discovery is unavailable to the judgment creditor. <em>M. Lowenstein & Sons, Inc. v. American Underwear Mfg. Co</em>., 11 F.R.D. 172 (E.D.Pa. 1951). Notwithstanding the language, and relying heavily on legislative history referring to Rule 33, the Fifth Circuit has held that a judgment creditor may invoke Rule 33 interrogatories. <em>United States v. McWhirter</em>, 376 F.2d 102 (5th Cir. 1967). But the court's reasoning does not extend to discovery except as provided in Rules 26&ndash;33. One commentator suggests that the existing language might properly be stretched to all discovery, 7 <em>Moore's Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;69.05[1] (2d ed. 1966), but another believes that a rules amendment is needed. 3 Barron & Holtzoff, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em> 1484 (Wright ed. 1958). Both commentators and the court in <em>McWhirter</em> are clear that, as a matter of policy, Rule 69 should authorize the use of all discovery devices provided in the rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 69 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Amended Rule 69(b) incorporates directly the provisions of 2 U.S.C. &sect;118 and 28 U.S.C. &sect;2006, deleting the incomplete statement in former Rule 69(b) of the circumstances in which execution does not issue against an officer.</p>
