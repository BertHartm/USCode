<h3 class="section-head">Rule 13. Counterclaim</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Compulsory Counterclaims.</strong> The answer shall state as a counterclaim any claim which, at the time of serving the answer, the defendant has against any plaintiff, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the answer need not state the claim if at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Permissive Counterclaims.</strong> The answer may state as a counterclaim any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim.</strong> A counterclaim may or may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Counterclaim Against the United States.</strong> These rules shall not be construed to enlarge beyond the limits now fixed by law the right to assert counterclaims or to claim credits against the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading.</strong> A claim which either matured or was acquired by the defendant after serving its pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Omitted Counterclaim.</strong> When the defendant fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, it may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Cross-Claim Against Co-Party.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Joinder of Additional Parties.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Separate Trials; Separate Judgments.</strong> If the court orders separate trials as provided in RCFC 42(b), judgment on a counterclaim may be rendered in accordance with the terms of RCFC 54(b) when the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party have been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) has been changed to add the language of FRCP 13(d) in recognition of the fact that there is no statutory bar to third-party defendants filing counterclaims against the United States. <em>See</em> 41 U.S.C. &sect;114 and RCFC 14. Other significant differences between this version and the FRCP have been preserved as necessary in light of the fact that the United States is the only defendant in this court.</p>
