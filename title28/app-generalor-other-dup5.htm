<p class="statutory-body">Setting a case for trial is the responsibility of the judge to whom the case is assigned, and may be made (1) without request of the parties or (2) upon request of a party and notice to the other parties or (3) in such other manner as the court deems expedient.

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 40 parallels, but is not identical to, FRCP 40. Like its FRCP counterpart, however, the purpose of the rule is to identify the responsibility of the judge in scheduling a matter for trial. The changes made to the text of the rule are minor and intended to clarify the rule's essential purpose, i.e., that it is the judge's responsibility to determine the date and place of trial in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;173, 798(a), and 2503(c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Directly Related Cases.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> At the time a complaint is filed, the filing attorney (or <em>pro se</em> plaintiff) shall file and serve on all parties who have appeared a Notice of Directly Related Case(s). Cases are deemed directly related when an earlier-filed case and the action being filed:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> involve the same contract, property or patent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Where a Notice of Directly Related Case(s) is filed along with a new complaint, the clerk shall assign the case to the judge to whom the earliest-filed directly related case is assigned. If the judge to whom the related case is assigned determines that the case in question is not in fact directly related, the judge will return the case to the clerk for random assignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Where the existence of directly related cases becomes apparent only after initial assignment, the Notice of Directly Related Case(s) shall be filed in all related cases, captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case. Solely for the purpose of filing this notice, counsel in the later-filed case may appear in the earlier-filed case. The notice may be accompanied by a motion to transfer and a suggestion for consolidation under RCFC 42.1. The assigned judge in the earliest-filed case, after consultation with the judge in the later-filed case, will grant or deny the motion to transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Content of the Notice of Directly Related Case(s).</strong> The notice shall contain the title and case number of the related case, a brief statement of the relationship of the actions according to the criteria set forth in subdivision (a), and a statement addressing whether assignment to a single judge or other action, including consolidation, is or is not likely to conserve judicial resources and promote an efficient determination of the actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Indirectly Related Cases.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Whenever it appears to a party that there are two or more cases before the court that present common issues of fact and that transfer, consolidation, or the adoption of a coordinated discovery schedule would significantly promote the efficient administration of justice, the party may file a Notice of Indirectly Related Case(s). The notice shall be captioned <!-- PDFPage:436 -->in the name of the earliest-filed case. Solely for purposes of filing the notice, counsel may appear in an earlier-filed case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The notice shall list the name and docket number of all indirectly related cases and shall detail the reasons supporting the proposed action. Counsel shall serve all parties in the related cases. The clerk shall file the notice in those cases and furnish a courtesy copy of the notice to the chief judge. Solely for the purpose of responding to the notice, counsel in the related cases may appear in the earliest-filed case to file a response to the notice. The response shall be filed within 21 days after service and captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case. Responses shall be served on counsel in all cases. The clerk shall file copies of the responses in each of the cases and shall furnish courtesy copies to the chief judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The assigned judge of the earliest-filed case shall call a meeting of all of the assigned judges to determine what, if any, action is appropriate. The parties to each action shall be notified of any resulting decision.</p>

<p class="note-body">RCFC 40.2 has no FRCP counterpart. The subject of the rule&mdash;Related Cases&mdash;previously appeared in these rules as RCFC 77(f) (as revised by General Order No. 36). The renumbering of the rule reflects its more logical placement in the structure of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike the predecessor rule, RCFC 40.2 recognizes two types of related cases: directly related cases and indirectly related cases. Directly related cases retain the definition that applied under former RCFC 77(f). Thus, cases that &ldquo;involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims&rdquo; or &ldquo;involve the same contract, property, or patent&rdquo; are deemed to be directly related. Cases that are directly related share an identity of parties and/or subject matter that, for the sake of consistency in outcome, warrant their assignment to a single judge. Indirectly related cases, by contrast, share only &ldquo;common issues of fact.&rdquo; In the interests of efficiency and the conservation of resources, such cases may warrant consolidated management during the pretrial stage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to recognizing two forms of related cases, RCFC 40.2 also prescribes the notice procedures that are to be followed for the identification of such cases to the court and interested counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> The Judicial Improvements Act of 2002, 28 U.S.C. &sect;363, directs the United States Court of Federal Claims to prescribe rules for the filing of complaints against judges of the court who have engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the court or who are unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> A copy of these rules, titled &ldquo;Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims Governing Complaints of Judicial Misconduct and Disability,&rdquo; is available upon request from the Office of the Clerk of the United States Court of Federal Claims, 717 Madison Place, NW, Washington, DC 20005, or may be obtained from the court's website at <em>www.uscfc.uscourts.gov</em>.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) By Plaintiff; by Stipulation.</strong> Subject to the provisions of RCFC 23 and of any statute of the United States, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (i) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs, or (ii) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States an action based on or including the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) By Order of Court.</strong> Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance [sic] save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by the United States prior to the service upon it of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.</strong> For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply <!-- PDFPage:437 -->with these rules or any order of court, the court may dismiss on its own motion or defendant may move for dismissal of an action or any claim. Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision of this rule and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for failure to join a party under RCFC 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Dismissal of Counterclaim or Third-Party Claim.</strong> The provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim or third-party claim. A voluntary dismissal by the claimant alone pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this rule shall be made before a responsive pleading is served or, if there is none, before the introduction of evidence at the trial or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Costs of Previously Dismissed Action.</strong> If a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action in any court commences an action based upon or including the same claim against the defendant, the court may make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it may deem proper and may stay the proceedings in the action until the plaintiff has complied with the order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Consolidation.</strong> When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials.</strong> The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Separate Determination of Liability.</strong> Upon stipulation of the parties, as approved by the court, or upon order of the court, a trial may be limited to the issues of law and fact relating to the right of a party to recover, reserving the determination of the amount of recovery, if any, for further proceedings. In any case, whether or not a stipulation or order has been made under subdivision (c) of this rule, the court, upon determining that a party is entitled to recover, may reserve determination of the amount of the recovery for further proceedings. Any motion for reconsideration shall be filed not later than 10 days after a separate determination of liability.</p>

A final certification may be made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of the documents, the court may, for good cause shown, (i) admit an attested copy without final certification or (ii) permit the foreign official record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification. The final certification is unnecessary if the record and the attestation are certified as provided in a treaty or convention to which the United States and the foreign country in which the official record is located are parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Lack of Record.</strong> A written statement that after diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records designated by the statement, authenticated as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this rule in the case of a domestic record, or complying with the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) of this rule for a summary in the case of a foreign record, is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Other Proof.</strong> This rule does not prevent the proof of official records or of entry or lack of entry therein by any other method authorized by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Form (See Appendix of Forms, Forms 6 and 7A); Issuance.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Every subpoena shall</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> state the name of the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> state the title of the action and its docket number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony or to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, documents or tangible things in the possession, custody or control of that person, or to permit inspection of premises, at a time and place therein specified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> set forth the text of subdivisions (c) and (d) of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A command to produce evidence or to permit inspection may be joined with a command to appear at trial or hearing or at deposition, or may be issued separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before service. An attorney as officer of the court, authorized to sign filings under RCFC 83.1, may also issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to such person and, if the person's attendance is commanded, by tendering to that person the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;1821. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be tendered. Prior notice of any commanded production of documents and things or inspection of premises before trial shall be served on each party in the manner prescribed by RCFC 5(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A) of this rule, a subpoena may be served at any place that is within 100 miles of the place of the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection specified in the subpoena, but the court upon proper application and good cause shown may authorize the service of a subpoena at any other place. A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country who is a national or resident of the United States shall issue under the circumstances and in the manner and be served as provided in Title 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Proof of service when necessary shall be made by filing with the clerk of the court a statement of the date and manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the person who made the service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protection of Persons Subject to Subpoenas.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a subpoena shall <!-- PDFPage:439 -->take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to that subpoena. The court shall enforce this duty and impose upon the party or attorney in breach of this duty an appropriate sanction, which may include, but is not limited to, lost earnings and a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)(A)</strong> A person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, documents or tangible things, or inspection of premises need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless commanded to appear for deposition, hearing or trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(B)</strong> Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this rule, a person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying may, within 14 days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than 14 days after service, serve upon the party or attorney designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials or of the premises. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the court. If objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an order to compel the production. Such an order to compel production shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying commanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)(A)</strong> On timely motion, the court shall quash or modify the subpoena if it</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(i)</strong> fails to allow reasonable time for compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(ii)</strong> requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to travel to a place more than 100 miles from the place where that person resides, is employed or regularly transacts business in person, except that, subject to the provisions of clause (c)(3)(B)(iii) of this rule, such a person may in order to attend trial be commanded to travel from any such place, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iii)</strong> requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter and no exception or waiver applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iv)</strong> subjects a person to undue burden.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(B)</strong> If a subpoena</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(i)</strong> requires disclosure of a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(ii)</strong> requires disclosure of an unretained expert's opinion or information not describing specific events or occurrences in dispute and resulting from the expert's study made not at the request of any party, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iii)</strong> requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial, the court may, to protect a person subject to or affected by the subpoena, quash or modify the subpoena or, if the party in whose behalf the subpoena is issued shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship and assures that the person to whom the subpoena is addressed will be reasonably compensated, the court may order appearance or production only upon specified conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Duties in Responding to Subpoena.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable the demanding party to contest the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Contempt.</strong> Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued. An adequate cause for failure to obey exists when a subpoena purports to require a nonparty to attend or produce at a place not within the limits provided by clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 52. Findings by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Effect.</strong> In all actions tried upon the facts, the court shall find the facts specially and state <!-- PDFPage:440 -->separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to RCFC 58; and in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall similarly set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action. Requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of review. Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_52_1_target" name="Rule_52_1">1</a></sup> credibility of the witnesses. It will be sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are stated orally and recorded in open court following the close of the evidence or appear in an opinion or memorandum of decision filed by the court. Findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under RCFC 12 or 56 or any other motion except as provided in subdivision (c) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendment.</strong> On a party's motion filed no later than 10 days after entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings&mdash;or make additional findings&mdash;and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under RCFC 59. The sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings may be later questioned whether or not in this court the party raising the question objected to the findings, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Judgment on Partial Findings.</strong> If during a trial a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue, or the court may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. Such a judgment shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>

<p class="note-body">The principal change in RCFC 52 relates to the enlargement of subdivision (c) to include, among issues subject to judgment on partial findings, the adjudication of issues critical to the legal sufficiency of a &ldquo;defense.&rdquo; The amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of law may be entered against both plaintiffs and defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> address pretrial and post-trial matters that cannot be addressed effectively and timely by the assigned judge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A master must not have a relationship to the parties, counsel, action, or assigned judge that would require disqualification of a judge under 28 U.S.C. &sect;455 unless the parties consent with the court's approval to appointment of a particular person after disclosure of any potential grounds for disqualification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> In requesting the appointment of a master, the assigned judge must consider the fairness of imposing the likely expenses on the parties and must protect against unreasonable expense or delay.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Order Appointing Master.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Notice.</strong> The assigned judge must give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard before a master is appointed. A party may suggest to the assigned judge candidates for appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Contents.</strong> The order appointing a master must direct the master to proceed with all reasonable diligence and must state:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the master's duties, including any investigation or enforcement duties, and any limits on the master's authority under Rule 53(c);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the circumstances&mdash;if any&mdash;in which the master may communicate ex parte with the assigned judge or a party;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Entry of Order.</strong> The assigned judge may request an order appointing a master only after the master has filed an affidavit disclosing whether there is any ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. &sect;455 and, if a ground for disqualification is disclosed, after the parties have consented with the assigned judge's approval to waive the disqualification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Amendment.</strong> The order appointing a master may be amended by the chief judge at any time upon the recommendation of the assigned judge. The assigned judge may make such a recommendation at any time after the assigned judge has given notice to the parties, and an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Master's Authority.</strong> Unless the appointing order expressly directs otherwise, a master has authority to regulate all proceedings and take all appropriate measures to perform fairly and efficiently the assigned duties.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Master's Reports.</strong> A master must report to the assigned judge as required by the order of appointment. The master must file the report and promptly serve a copy of the report on each party unless the assigned judge directs otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Action on Master's Order, Report, or Recommendations.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Action.</strong> In acting on a master's order, report, or recommendations, the assigned judge must afford an opportunity to be heard and may receive evidence, and may: adopt or affirm; modify; wholly or partly reject or reverse; or resubmit to the master with instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Time To Object or Move.</strong> A party may file objections to&mdash;or a motion to adopt or modify&mdash;the master's order, report, or recommendations no later than 20 days from the time the master's order, report, or recommendations are served, unless the assigned judge sets a different time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Fact Findings.</strong> The assigned judge must decide de novo all objections to findings of fact made or recommended by a master unless the parties stipulate with the assigned judge's consent that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the master's findings will be reviewed for clear error, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> the findings of a master appointed under RCFC 53(a)(1)(A) or (C) will be final.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Legal Conclusions.</strong> The assigned judge must decide de novo all objections to conclusions of law made or recommended by a master.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Procedural Matters.</strong> Unless the order of appointment establishes a different standard of review, the assigned judge may set aside a master's ruling on a procedural matter only for an abuse of discretion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Compensation.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Fixing Compensation.</strong> The assigned judge must fix the master's compensation before or after judgment on the basis and terms stated in the order of appointment. The chief judge, upon the recommendation of the assigned judge, may set a new basis and terms. The assigned judge may make such a recommendation after the assigned judge has given notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 53 adopts the significantly revised text of FRCP 53, effective December 1, 2003, with minor adjustments in language reflecting differences in jurisdiction between this court and the district courts. The principal adjustments in language occur in the introductory text of subdivision (a) which adds the words &ldquo;the chief judge, at the request of the assigned judge&rdquo; as an additional qualification to the appointment of a master and in the related text of subdivisions (b)(4) and (h)(1). The distinction between the roles of chief judge and assigned judge is carried through into the subdivisions of the rule where the words &ldquo;assigned judge&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;court.&rdquo; The added language addresses the fact that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;798(c), the court's authority to appoint special masters to assist the court in carrying out its functions rests exclusively with the chief judge.</p>
