<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Setting a case for trial is the responsibility of the judge to whom the case is assigned, and may be made (1) without request of the parties or (2) upon request of a party and notice to the other parties or (3) in such other manner as the court deems expedient. All trials shall be scheduled by the judge by order filed with the clerk. Precedence shall be given to actions entitled thereto by any statute of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The text of RCFC 40 parallels, but is not identical to, FRCP 40. Like its federal rules counterpart, however, the purpose of the rule is to identify the responsibility of the judge in scheduling a matter for trial. The changes made to the text of the rule are minor and intended to clarify the rule's essential purpose, i.e., that it is the judge's responsibility to determine the date and place of trial in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;173, 798(a), and 2503(c).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Directly-Related Cases.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> At the time a complaint is filed, the filing attorney (or <em>pro se</em> plaintiff) shall file and serve on all parties who have appeared a Notice of Directly-Related Case(s). Cases are deemed directly related when an earlier-filed case and the action being filed:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> involve the same contract, property or patent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Where a Notice of Directly-Related Cases is filed along with the new complaint, the clerk shall assign the case to the judge to whom the earliest-filed directly-related case is assigned. If the judge to whom the related case is assigned determines that the case in question is not in fact directly related, the judge will return the case to the clerk for random assignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Where the existence of directly-related cases becomes apparent only after initial assignment, the Notice of Directly-Related Cases shall be filed in all related cases, captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case. Solely for the purpose of filing this notice, counsel in the later-filed case may appear in the earlier-filed case. The Notice may be accompanied by a motion to transfer and a suggestion for consolidation under RCFC 42.1. The judge in the earliest-filed case, after consultation with the judge in the later-filed case, will grant or deny the motion to transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> Content of the Notice of Directly-Related Case(s). The notice of related case shall contain: the title and case number of the related case; a brief statement of the relationship of the actions according to the criteria set forth in subdivision (a); and a statement addressing whether assignment to a single judge or other action, including consolidation, is or is not likely to conserve judicial resources and promote an efficient determination of the actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Indirectly-Related Cases.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Whenever it appears to a party that there are two or more cases before the court that present common issues of fact and that transfer, consolidation, or the adoption of a coordinated discovery schedule would significantly promote the efficient administration of justice, the party may file a Notice of Indirectly-Related Cases. The notice shall be captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case which is related. Solely for purposes of filing the notice, counsel may appear in an earlier-filed case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> The notice shall list the name and docket number of all indirectly-related cases and shall detail the reasons supporting the proposed action. Counsel shall serve all parties in the related cases. The clerk shall file the notice in those cases and furnish a courtesy copy of the notice to the chief judge. Solely for the purpose of responding to the notice, counsel in the related cases may appear in the earliest-filed case to file a response to the notice. The response shall be filed within 21 days of service and captioned in the name of the earliest-filed case. Responses shall be served on counsel in all cases. The clerk shall file copies of the responses in each of the cases and shall furnish courtesy copies to the chief judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The presiding judge of the earliest-filed case shall call a meeting of all of the presiding judges to determine what, if any, action is appropriate. The parties to each action shall be notified of any resulting decision.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 40.2 has no FRCP counterpart. The subject of the rule&mdash;Related Cases&mdash;previously appeared in these rules as RCFC 77(f) (as revised by General Order No. 36). The renumbering of the rule reflects its more logical placement in the structure of the court's rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike the predecessor rule, RCFC 40.2 recognizes two types of related cases: directly-related cases and indi<!-- PDFPage:430 -->rectly-related cases. Directly-related cases retain the definition that applied under former RCFC 77(f). Thus, cases that &ldquo;involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims&rdquo; or &ldquo;involve the same contract, property, or patent&rdquo; are deemed to be directly related. Cases that are directly related share an identity of parties and/or subject matter that, for the sake of consistency in outcome, warrant their assignment to a single judge. Indirectly-related cases, by contrast, share only &ldquo;common issues of fact.&rdquo; In the interests of efficiency and the conservation of resources, such cases may warrant consolidated management during their pretrial stage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to recognizing two forms of related cases, RCFC 40.2 also prescribes the notice procedures that are to be followed for the identification of such cases to the court and interested counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a)</strong> The Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980, 28 U.S.C. &sect;372(c)(18), directs the United States Court of Federal Claims to prescribe rules for the filing of complaints against judges of the court who have engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the court or who are unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b)</strong> A copy of these rules, titled &ldquo;Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims Governing Complaints of Judicial Misconduct and Disability,&rdquo; is available upon request from the Office of the Clerk of the United States Court of Federal Claims, 717 Madison Place, NW, Washington, DC 20005.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) By Plaintiff; by Stipulation.</strong> Subject to the provisions of RCFC 23, and of any statute of the United States, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (i) by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs, or (ii) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States an action based on or including the same claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) By Order of Court.</strong> Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by the United States prior to the service upon it of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.</strong> For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, the court may dismiss on its own motion or defendant may move for dismissal of an action or any claim. Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision of this rule and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, or for failure to join a party under RCFC 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Dismissal of Counterclaim or Third-Party Claim.</strong> The provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim or third-party claim. A voluntary dismissal by the claimant alone pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this rule shall be made before a responsive pleading is served or, if there is none, before the introduction of evidence at the trial or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Costs of Previously-Dismissed Action.</strong> If a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action in any court commences an action based upon or including the same claim against the defendant, the court may make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it may deem proper and may stay the proceedings in the action until the plaintiff has complied with the order.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Consolidation.</strong> When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Trials.</strong> The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Separate Determination of Liability.</strong> Upon stipulation of the parties, approved by the court, or upon order of the court, a trial may be lim<!-- PDFPage:431 -->ited to the issues of law and fact relating to the right of a party to recover, reserving the determination of the amount of recovery, if any, for further proceedings. In any case, whether or not a stipulation or order has been made under subdivision (c) of this rule, the court, upon determining that a party is entitled to recover, may reserve determination of the amount of the recovery for further proceedings. Any motion for reconsideration shall be filed not later than 10 days after a separate determination of liability.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Authentication.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Domestic.</strong> An official record kept within the United States, or any state, district, or commonwealth, or within a territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or by the officer's deputy, and accompanied by a certificate that such officer has the custody. The certificate may be made by a judge of a court of record of the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the court, or may be made by any public officer having a seal of office and having official duties in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the officer's office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Foreign.</strong> A foreign official record, or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof; or a copy thereof, attested by a person authorized to make the attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to the genuineness of the signature and official position (i) of the attesting person, or (ii) of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official position relates to the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position relating to the attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of the documents, the court may, for good cause shown, (i) admit an attested copy without final certification or (ii) permit the foreign official record to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without a final certification. The final certification is unnecessary if the record and the attestation are certified as provided in a treaty or convention to which the United States and the foreign country in which the official record is located are parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Lack of Record.</strong> A written statement that after diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records designated by the statement, authenticated as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this rule in the case of a domestic record, or complying with the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) of this rule for a summary in the case of a foreign record, is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Form (See Appendix of Forms, Forms 6 and 7A); Issuance.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Every subpoena shall</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> state the name of the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> state the title of the action and its docket number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony or to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, documents or tangible things in the possession, custody or control of that person, or to permit inspection of premises, at a time and place therein specified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> set forth the text of subdivisions (c) and (d) of this rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A command to produce evidence or to permit inspection may be joined with a command to appear at trial or hearing or at deposition, or may be issued separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before service. An attorney as officer of the court, authorized to sign filings under RCFC 83.1, may also issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Service.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to such person and, if the person's attendance is commanded, by tendering to that person the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;1821. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be tendered. Prior notice of any commanded production of documents and things or inspection of premises before trial shall be served on each party in the manner prescribed by RCFC 5(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A) of this rule, a subpoena may be served at any place that is within 100 miles of the place of the deposition, hearing, trial, production, or inspection specified in the subpoena; but the court upon proper application and good cause shown may authorize the service of a subpoena at any other place. A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country who is a national or resident of the United States shall issue under the circumstances and in the manner and be served as provided in Title 28 U.S.C. &sect;1783.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> Proof of service when necessary shall be made by filing with the clerk of the court a statement of the date and manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the person who made the service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protection of Persons Subject to Subpoenas.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to that subpoena. The court shall enforce this duty and impose upon the party or attorney in breach of this duty an appropriate sanction, which may include, but is not limited to, lost earnings and a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)(A)</strong> A person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, documents or tangible things or inspection of premises need not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless commanded to appear for deposition, hearing or trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(B)</strong> Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this rule, a person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying may, within 14 days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than 14 days after service, serve upon the party or attorney designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials or of the premises. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the court. If objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an order to compel the production. Such an order to compel production shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party from significant expense resulting from the inspection and copying commanded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)(A)</strong> On timely motion, the court shall quash or modify the subpoena if it</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(i)</strong> fails to allow reasonable time for compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(ii)</strong> requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to travel to a place more than 100 miles from the place where that person resides, is employed or regularly transacts business in person, except that, subject to the provisions of clause (c)(3)(B)(iii) of this rule, such a person may in order to attend trial be commanded to travel from any such place, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iii)</strong> requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter and no exception or waiver applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iv)</strong> subjects a person to undue burden.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(B)</strong> If a subpoena</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(i)</strong> requires disclosure of a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(ii)</strong> requires disclosure of an unretained expert's opinion or information not describing <!-- PDFPage:433 -->specific events or occurrences in dispute and resulting from the expert's study made not at the request of any party, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(iii)</strong> requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to incur substantial expense to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial, the court may, to protect a person subject to or affected by the subpoena, quash or modify the subpoena or, if the party in whose behalf the subpoena is issued shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship and assures that the person to whom the subpoena is addressed will be reasonably compensated, the court may order appearance or production only upon specified conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Duties in Responding to Subpoena.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to enable the demanding party to contest the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Contempt.</strong> Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued. An adequate cause for failure to obey exists when a subpoena purports to require a nonparty to attend or produce at a place not within the limits provided by clause (ii) of subparagraph (c)(3)(A).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 52. Findings by the Court; Judgment on Partial Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Effect.</strong> In all actions tried upon the facts, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to RCFC 58; and in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall similarly set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action. Requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of review. Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_52_1_target" name="Rule_52_1">1</a></sup> credibility of the witnesses. It will be sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are stated orally and recorded in open court following the close of the evidence or appear in an opinion or memorandum of decision filed by the court. Findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under RCFC 12 or 56 or any other motion except as provided in subdivision (c) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendment.</strong> On a party's motion filed no later than 10 days after entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings&mdash;or make additional findings&mdash;and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under RCFC 59. The sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings may be questioned whether or not the party raising the question objected to the findings, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Judgment on Partial Findings.</strong> If during a trial a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue, or the court may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. Such a judgment shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">The principal change in RCFC 52 relates to the enlargement of subdivision (c) to include, among issues subject to judgment on partial findings, the adjudication of issues critical to the legal sufficiency of a &ldquo;defense.&rdquo; The amendment makes clear that judgments as a matter of law may be entered against both plaintiffs <!-- PDFPage:434 -->and defendants and with respect to issues or defenses that may not be wholly dispositive of a claim or defense.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 53. Masters</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Appointment and Compensation.</strong> The chief judge, at the request of the presiding judge, may appoint a special master. As used in these rules, the word &ldquo;master&rdquo; includes a referee, an auditor, an examiner, and an assessor. The compensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties or paid out of any fund or subject matter of the action, which is in the custody and control of the court as the court may direct. The master shall not retain the master's report as security for the master's compensation; but when the party ordered to pay the compensation allowed by the court does not pay it after notice and within the time prescribed by the court, the master is entitled to a writ of execution against the delinquent party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Reference.</strong> A reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule. Save in matters of account and of difficult computation of damages, a reference shall be made only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Powers.</strong> The order of reference to the master may specify or limit the master's powers and may direct the master to report only upon particular issues or to do or perform particular acts or to receive and report evidence only and may fix the time and place for beginning and closing the hearings and for the filing of the master's report. Subject to the specifications and limitations stated in the order, the master has and shall exercise the power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before the master and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the master's duties under the order. The master may require the production before the master of evidence upon all matters embraced in the reference, including the production of all books, papers, vouchers, documents, and writings applicable thereto. The master may rule upon the admissibility of evidence unless otherwise directed by the order of reference and has the authority to put witnesses on oath and may examine them and may call the parties to the action and examine them upon oath. When a party so requests, the master shall make a record of the evidence offered and excluded in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as provided in the Federal Rules of Evidence for a court sitting without a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Proceedings.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Meetings.</strong> When a reference is made, the clerk shall forthwith furnish the master with a copy of the order of reference. Upon receipt thereof unless the order of reference otherwise provides, the master shall forthwith set a time and place for the first meeting of the parties or their attorneys to be held within 20 days after the date of the order of reference and shall notify the parties or their attorneys. It is the duty of the master to proceed with all reasonable diligence. Either party, on notice to the parties and master, may apply to the court for an order requiring the master to speed the proceedings and to make the report. If a party fails to appear at the time and place appointed, the master may proceed <em>ex parte</em> or, in the master's discretion, adjourn the proceedings to a future day, giving notice to the absent party of the adjournment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Witnesses.</strong> The parties may procure the attendance of witnesses before the master by the issuance and service of subpoenas as provided in RCFC 45. If without adequate excuse a witness fails to appear or give evidence, the witness may be punished as for a contempt and be subjected to the consequences, penalties, and remedies provided in RCFC 37 and 45.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Statement of Accounts.</strong> When matters of accounting are in issue before the master, the master may prescribe the form in which the accounts shall be submitted and in any proper case may require or receive in evidence a statement by a certified public accountant who is called as a witness. Upon objection of a party to any of the items thus submitted or upon a showing that the form of statement is insufficient, the master may require a different form of statement to be furnished, or the accounts or specific items thereof to be proved by oral examination of the accounting parties or upon written interrogatories or in such other manner as the master directs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Report.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Contents and Filing.</strong> The master shall prepare a report upon the matters submitted to the master by the order of reference and, if required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, the master shall set them forth in the report. The master shall file the report with the clerk of the court and serve on all parties notice of the filing. Unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall file with the report a transcript of the proceedings and of the evidence and the original exhibits. Unless otherwise directed by the order of reference, the master shall serve a copy of the report on each party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Acceptance of Report.</strong> The court shall accept the master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. Within 10 days after being served with notice of the filing of the report any party may serve written objections thereto upon the other parties. Application to the court for action upon the report and upon objections thereto shall be by motion. The court after hearing may adopt the report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part or may receive further evidence or may recommit it with instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) In Jury Actions.</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Stipulation as to Findings.</strong> The effect of a master's report is the same whether or not the parties have consented to the reference; but, when the parties stipulate that a master's findings of fact shall be final, only questions of law arising upon the report shall thereafter be considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Draft Report.</strong> Before filing the master's report, a master may submit a draft thereof to counsel for all parties for the purpose of receiving their suggestions.</p>
