<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Hearing or Rehearing En Banc May Be Ordered.</strong> A majority of the circuit judges who are in regular active service may order that an appeal or other proceeding be heard or reheard by the court of appeals en banc. An en banc hearing or rehearing is not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the court's decisions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Petition for Hearing or Rehearing En Banc.</strong> A party may petition for a hearing or rehearing en banc.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The petition must begin with a statement that either:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the panel decision conflicts with a decision of the United States Supreme Court or of the court to which the petition is addressed (with citation to the conflicting case or cases) and consideration by the full court is therefore necessary to secure and maintain uniformity of the court's decisions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the proceeding involves one or more questions of exceptional importance, each of which must be concisely stated; for example, a petition may assert that a proceeding presents a question of exceptional importance if it involves an issue on which the panel decision conflicts with the authoritative decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Except by the court's permission, a petition for an en banc hearing or rehearing must not exceed 15 pages, excluding material not counted under Rule 32.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For purposes of the page limit in Rule 35(b)(2), if a party files both a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for rehearing en banc, they are considered a single document even if they are filed separately, unless separate filing is required by local rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Time for Petition for Hearing or Rehearing En Banc.</strong> A petition that an appeal be heard initially en banc must be filed by the date when the appellee's brief is due. A petition for a rehearing en banc must be filed within the time prescribed by Rule 40 for filing a petition for rehearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Number of Copies.</strong> The number of copies to be filed must be prescribed by local rule and may be altered by order in a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Response.</strong> No response may be filed to a petition for an en banc consideration unless the court orders a response.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:55 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Call for a Vote.</strong> A vote need not be taken to determine whether the case will be heard or reheard en banc unless a judge calls for a vote.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1967</h4>
<p class="note-body">Statutory authority for in banc hearings is found in 28 U.S.C. &sect;46(c). The proposed rule is responsive to the Supreme Court's view in <em>Western Pacific Ry. Corp. v. Western Pacific Ry. Co</em>., 345 U.S. 247, 73 S.Ct. 656, 97 L.Ed. 986 (1953), that litigants should be free to suggest that a particular case is appropriate for consideration by all the judges of a court of appeals. The rule is addressed to the procedure whereby a party may suggest the appropriateness of convening the court in banc. It does not affect the power of a court of appeals to initiate in banc hearings <em>sua sponte.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">The provision that a vote will not be taken as a result of the suggestion of the party unless requested by a judge of the court in regular active service or by a judge who was a member of the panel that rendered a decision sought to be reheard is intended to make it clear that a suggestion of a party as such does not require any action by the court. See <em>Western Pacific Ry. Corp. v. Western Pacific Ry. Co</em>., supra, 345 U.S. at 262, 73 S.Ct. 656. The rule merely authorizes a suggestion, imposes a time limit on suggestions for rehearings in banc, and provides that suggestions will be directed to the judges of the court in regular active service.</p>
<p class="note-body">In practice, the suggestion of a party that a case be reheard in banc is frequently contained in a petition for rehearing, commonly styled &ldquo;petition for rehearing in banc.&rdquo; Such a petition is in fact merely a petition for a rehearing, with a suggestion that the case be reheard in banc. Since no response to the suggestion, as distinguished from the petition for rehearing, is required, the panel which heard the case may quite properly dispose of the petition without reference to the suggestion. In such a case the fact that no response has been made to the suggestion does not affect the finality of the judgment or the issuance of the mandate, and the final sentence of the rule expressly so provides.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the present rule there is no specific provision for a response to a suggestion that an appeal be heard in banc. This has led to some uncertainty as to whether such a response may be filed. The proposed amendment would resolve this uncertainty.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the present rule provides a time limit for suggestions for rehearing in banc, it does not deal with the timing of a request that the appeal be heard in banc initially. The proposed amendment fills this gap as well, providing that the suggestion must be made by the date of which the appellee's brief is filed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provision is made for circulating the suggestions to members of the panel despite the fact that senior judges on the panel would not be entitled to vote on whether a suggestion will be granted.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Subdivision (d) is added; it authorizes the courts of appeals to prescribe the number of copies of suggestions for hearing or rehearing in banc that must be filed. Because the number of copies needed depends directly upon the number of judges in the circuit, local rules are the best vehicle for setting the required number of copies.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language and organization of the rule are amended to make the rule more easily understood. In addition to changes made to improve the understanding, the Advisory Committee has changed language to make style and terminology consistent throughout the appellate rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several substantive changes are made in this rule, however.</p>
<p class="note-body">One of the purposes of the substantive amendments is to treat a request for a rehearing en banc like a petition for panel rehearing so that a request for a rehearing en banc will suspend the finality of the court of appeals&rsquo; judgment and delay the running of the period for filing a petition for writ of certiorari. Companion amendments are made to Rule 41.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (a).</strong> The title of this subdivision is changed from &ldquo;when hearing or rehearing in banc <em>will</em> be ordered&rdquo; to &ldquo;When Hearing or Rehearing En Banc <em>May</em> Be Ordered.&rdquo; The change emphasizes the discretion a court has with regard to granting en banc review.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (b).</strong> The term &ldquo;petition&rdquo; for rehearing en banc is substituted for the term &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; for rehearing en banc. The terminology change reflects the Committee's intent to treat similarly a petition for panel rehearing and a request for a rehearing en banc. The terminology change also delays the running of the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari because Sup. Ct. R. 13.3 says:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by any party, the time to file the petition for a writ of certiorari for all parties .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. runs from the date of the denial of the petition for rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing is granted, the subsequent entry of judgment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments also require each petition for en banc consideration to begin with a statement concisely demonstrating that the case meets the usual criteria for en banc consideration. It is the Committee's hope that requiring such a statement will cause the drafter of a petition to focus on the narrow grounds that support en banc consideration and to realize that a petition should not be filed unless the case meets those rigid standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">Intercircuit conflict is cited as one reason for asserting that a proceeding involves a question of &ldquo;exceptional importance.&rdquo; Intercircuit conflicts create problems. When the circuits construe the same federal law differently, parties&rsquo; rights and duties depend upon where a case is litigated. Given the increase in the number of cases decided by the federal courts and the limitation on the number of cases the Supreme Court can hear, conflicts between the circuits may remain unresolved by the Supreme Court for an extended period of time. The existence of an intercircuit conflict often generates additional litigation in the other circuits as well as in the circuits that are already in conflict. Although an en banc proceeding will not necessarily prevent intercircuit conflicts, an en banc proceeding provides a safeguard against unnecessary intercircuit conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some circuits have had rules or internal operating procedures that recognize a conflict with another circuit as a legitimate basis for granting a rehearing en banc. An intercircuit conflict may present a question of &ldquo;exceptional importance&rdquo; because of the costs that intercircuit conflicts impose on the system as a whole, in addition to the significance of the issues involved. It is not, however, the Committee's intent to make the granting of a hearing or rehearing en banc mandatory whenever there is an intercircuit conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment states that &ldquo;a petition may assert that a proceeding presents a question of exceptional importance if it involves an issue on which the panel decision conflicts with the authoritative decisions of every other United States Court of Appeals that has addressed the issue.&rdquo; [The Supreme Court revised the proposed amendment to Rule 35(b)(1)(B) by deleting &ldquo;every&rdquo; before &ldquo;other United States Court of Appeals&rdquo;.] That language contemplates two situations in which a rehearing en banc may be appropriate. The first is when a panel decision creates a conflict. A panel decision creates a conflict when it conflicts with the decisions of all other circuits that have considered the <!-- PDFPage:56 -->issue. If a panel decision simply joins one side of an already existing conflict, a rehearing en banc may not be as important because it cannot avoid the conflict. The second situation that may be a strong candidate for a rehearing en banc is one in which the circuit persists in a conflict created by a pre-existing decision of the same circuit and no other circuits have joined on that side of the conflict. The amendment states that the conflict must be with an &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; decision of another circuit. &ldquo;Authoritative&rdquo; is used rather than &ldquo;published&rdquo; because in some circuits unpublished opinions may be treated as authoritative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Counsel are reminded that their duty is fully discharged without filing a petition for rehearing en banc unless the case meets the rigid standards of subdivision (a) of this rule and even then the granting of a petition is entirely within the court's discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) of this subdivision establishes a maximum length for a petition. Fifteen pages is the length currently used in several circuits. Each request for en banc consideration must be studied by every active judge of the court and is a serious call on limited judicial resources. The extraordinary nature of the issue or the threat to uniformity of the court's decision can be established in most cases in less than fifteen pages. A court may shorten the maximum length on a case by case basis but the rule does not permit a circuit to shorten the length by local rule. The Committee has retained page limits rather than using word or line counts similar to those in amended Rule 32 because there has not been a serious enough problem to justify importing the word and line-count and typeface requirements that are applicable to briefs into other contexts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3), although similar to (2), is separate because it deals with those instances in which a party files both a petition for rehearing en banc under this rule and a petition for panel rehearing under Rule 40.</p>
<p class="note-body">To improve the clarity of the rule, the material dealing with filing a response to a petition and with voting on a petition have been moved to new subdivisions (e) and (f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (c).</strong> Two changes are made in this subdivision. First, the sentence stating that a request for a rehearing en banc does not affect the finality of the judgment or stay the issuance of the mandate is deleted. Second, the language permitting a party to include a request for rehearing en banc in a petition for panel rehearing is deleted. The Committee believes that those circuits that want to require two separate documents should have the option to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (e).</strong> This is a new subdivision. The substance of the subdivision, however, was drawn from former subdivision (b). The only changes are stylistic; no substantive changes are intended.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Subdivision (f).</strong> This is a new subdivision. The substance of the subdivision, however, was drawn from former subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because of the discretionary nature of the en banc procedure, the filing of a suggestion for rehearing en banc has not required a vote; a vote is taken only when requested by a judge. It is not the Committee's intent to change the discretionary nature of the procedure or to require a vote on a petition for rehearing en banc. The rule continues, therefore, to provide that a court is not obligated to vote on such petitions. It is necessary, however, that each court develop a procedure for disposing of such petitions because they will suspend the finality of the court's judgment and toll the time for filing a petition for certiorari.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (b) contained language directing the clerk to distribute a &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; to certain judges and indicating which judges may call for a vote. New subdivision (f) does not address those issues because they deal with internal court procedures.</p>
