<h3 class="section-head">Rule 46. Objecting to a Ruling or Order</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A formal exception to a ruling or order is unnecessary. When the ruling or order is requested or made, a party need only state the action that it wants the court to take or objects to, along with the grounds for the request or objection. Failing to object does not prejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the ruling or order was made.</p>

<p class="note-body">Abolition of formal exceptions is often provided by statute. See Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937), ch. 110, &sect;204; Neb.Comp.Stat. (1929) &sect;20&ndash;1139; N.M.Stat.Ann. (Courtright, 1929) &sect;105&ndash;830; 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7653; Ohio Code Ann. (Throckmorton, 1936) &sect;11560; 1 S.D.Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;2542; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933) &sect;&sect;104&ndash;39&ndash;2, 104&ndash;24&ndash;18; Va.Rules of Court, Rule 22, 163 Va. v, xii (1935); Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;270.39. Compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;583, 445, and 446, all as amended by L. 1936, ch. 915. Rule 51 deals with objections to the court's instructions to the jury.</p>
<p class="note-body">U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;776 (Bill of exceptions; authentication; signing of by judge) and [former] 875 (Review of findings in cases tried without a jury) are superseded insofar as they provide for formal exceptions, and a bill of exceptions.</p>
