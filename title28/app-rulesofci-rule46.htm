<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Formal exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which the party desires the court to take or the party's objection to the action of the court and the grounds therefor; and, if a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection does not thereafter prejudice the party.</p>

<p class="note-body">Abolition of formal exceptions is often provided by statute. See Ill.Rev.Stat. (1937), ch. 110, &sect;204; Neb.Comp.Stat. (1929) &sect;20&ndash;1139; N.M.Stat.Ann. (Courtright, 1929) &sect;105&ndash;830; 2 N.D.Comp.Laws Ann. (1913) &sect;7653; Ohio Code Ann. (Throckmorton, 1936) &sect;11560; 1 S.D.Comp.Laws (1929) &sect;2542; Utah Rev.Stat.Ann. (1933) &sect;&sect;104&ndash;39&ndash;2, 104&ndash;24&ndash;18; Va.Rules of Court, Rule 22, 163 Va. v, xii (1935); Wis.Stat. (1935) &sect;270.39. Compare N.Y.C.P.A. (1937) &sect;&sect;583, 445, and 446, all as amended by L. 1936, ch. 915. Rule 51 deals with objections to the court's instructions to the jury.</p>
<p class="note-body">U.S.C., Title 28, [former] &sect;&sect;776 (Bill of exceptions; authentication; signing of by judge) and [former] 875 (Review of findings in cases tried without a jury) are superseded insofar as they provide for formal exceptions, and a bill of exceptions.</p>
