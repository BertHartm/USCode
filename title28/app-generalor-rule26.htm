<h3 class="section-head">Rule 26. General Provisions Governing Discovery</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Discovery Methods.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property, for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; requests for admission; and calls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discovery Scope and Limits.</strong> Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods set forth in subdivision (a) of this rule shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the limitations on the parties&rsquo; resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. The court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion under subdivision (c) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2) <em>Trial Preparation: Materials.</em></strong> Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)(3) of this rule, a party may obtain discovery of documents and <!-- PDFPage:370 -->tangible things otherwise discoverable under subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative (including that other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party. Upon request, a person not a party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that person. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement previously made is (A) a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or (B) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3) <em>Trial Preparation: Experts.</em></strong> Discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under the provisions of subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be obtained only as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(A)(i)</strong> A party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion. <strong>(ii)</strong> Upon motion, the court may order further discovery by other means, subject to such restrictions as to scope and such provisions, pursuant to subdivision (b)(3)(C) of this rule, concerning fees and expenses as the court may deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(B)</strong> A party may discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial, only as provided in Rule 35(b) or upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(C)</strong> Unless manifest injustice would result: <strong>(i)</strong> the court shall require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery under subdivisions (b)(3)(A)(ii) and (b)(3)(B) of this rule; and <strong>(ii)</strong> with respect to discovery obtained under subdivision (b)(3)(A)(ii) of this rule the court may require, and with respect to discovery obtained under subdivision (b)(3)(B) of this rule the court shall require, the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protective Orders.</strong> Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, see Appendix G 8, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following: <strong>(1)</strong> that the discovery not be had; <strong>(2)</strong> that the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place; <strong>(3)</strong> that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery; <strong>(4)</strong> that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be limited to certain matters; <strong>(5)</strong> that discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court; <strong>(6)</strong> that a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of the court; <strong>(7)</strong> that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; <strong>(8)</strong> that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court. If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The provisions of Rule 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Sequence and Timing of Discovery.</strong> Unless the court upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, shall not operate to delay any other party's discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Supplementation of Responses.</strong> A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the party's response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the party's response with respect to any question directly addressed to <strong>(A)</strong> the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and <strong>(B)</strong> the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the expert witness is expected to testify, and the substance of the expert witness&rsquo; testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if the party obtains information upon the basis of which <strong>(A)</strong> the party knows that the response was incorrect when made or <strong>(B)</strong> the party knows that the response though correct when made is no longer true and <!-- PDFPage:371 -->the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Discovery Conference.</strong> At any time after commencement of an action the court may direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for a conference on the subject of discovery. The court may do so upon motion by the attorney for any party if the motion includes:</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(1)</strong> A statement of the issues as they then appear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(2)</strong> A proposed plan and schedule of discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(3)</strong> Any limitations proposed to be placed on discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(4)</strong> Any other proposed orders with respect to discovery; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(5)</strong> A statement showing that the attorney making the motion has made a reasonable effort to reach agreement with opposing attorneys on the matters set forth in the motion. Each party and each party's attorney are under a duty to participate in good faith in the framing of a discovery plan if a plan is proposed by the attorney for any party. Notice of the motion shall be served on all parties. Objections or additions to matters set forth in the motion shall be served not later than 10 days after service of the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Following the discovery conference, the court may enter an order tentatively identifying the issues for discovery purposes, establishing a plan and schedule for discovery, setting limitations on discovery, if any; and determining such other matters, including the allocation of expenses, as are necessary for the proper management of discovery in the action. An order may be altered or amended whenever justice so requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the right of a party who properly moves for a discovery conference to prompt convening of the conference, the court may combine the discovery conference with a pretrial conference authorized by Rule 16.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Signing of Discovery Requests, Responses, and Objections.</strong> Every request for discovery or response or objection thereto made by a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by the attorney of record in such attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign the request, response, or objection and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that the attorney or party has read the request, response, or objection and that to the best of the attorney's or party's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry it is: <strong>(1)</strong> consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; <strong>(2)</strong> not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay, or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and <strong>(3)</strong> not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If a certification is made in violation of these rules, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose behalf the request, response, or objection is made, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
