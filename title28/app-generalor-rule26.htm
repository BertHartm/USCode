<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Required Disclosures; Methods to Discover Additional Matter.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) Initial Disclosures.</strong> Except in categories of proceedings specified in RCFC 26(a)(1)(E), or to the extent otherwise stipulated or directed by order, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to other parties:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment, identifying the subjects of the information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> a copy of, or a description by category and location of, all documents, data compilations, and tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party and that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> a computation of any category of damages claimed by the disclosing party, making available for inspection and copying as under RCFC 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, not privileged or protected from disclosure, on which such computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(D)</strong> [Not used.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(E)</strong> The following categories of proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure under RCFC 26(a)(1):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(i)</strong> an action for review on an administrative record, including procurement protest and military pay cases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ii)</strong> [Not used.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iii)</strong> an action brought without counsel by a person in custody of the United States, a state, or a state subdivision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(iv, v, vi and vii)</strong> [Not used.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(viii)</strong> an action to enforce an arbitration award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em"><strong>(ix)</strong> an action under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">These disclosures must be made within 14 days after the filing of the Joint Preliminary Status Report (see Appendix A &nbsp;4) unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during the Early Meeting of Counsel (see Appendix A &nbsp;3) that initial disclosures are not appropriate in the circumstances of the action and states the objection in the Joint Preliminary Status Report. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures&mdash;if any&mdash;are to be made, and set the time for disclosure. Any party first served or otherwise joined after the Joint Preliminary Status Report must make these disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order. A party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it and is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully completed its investigation of the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Disclosure of Expert Testimony.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> In addition to the disclosures required by paragraph (1), a party shall disclose to other parties the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present evidence under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> Except as otherwise stipulated or directed by the court, this disclosure shall, with respect to a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony, be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the wit<!-- PDFPage:418 -->ness. The report shall contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor; the data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions; any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions; the qualifications of the witness, including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the preceding ten years; the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony; and a listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within the preceding four years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> These disclosures shall be made at the times and in the sequence directed by the court. In the absence of other directions from the court or stipulation by the parties, see Appendix A &nbsp;5, 8, the disclosures shall be made at least 70 days before the scheduled close of discovery or, if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under paragraph (2)(B), within 30 days after the disclosure made by the other party. The parties shall supplement these disclosures when required under subdivision (e)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Pretrial Disclosures.</strong> [Not used. See Appendix A &nbsp;13, 15, 16.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Form of Disclosures.</strong> Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under RCFC 26(a)(1) through (3) must be made in writing, signed, and served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Methods to Discover Additional Matter.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property under RCFC 34 or 45(a)(1)(C), for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Discovery Scope and Limits.</strong> Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) In General.</strong> Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. Relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. All discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by RCFC 26(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) Limitations.</strong> By order, the court may alter the limits in these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or the length of depositions under RCFC 30. By order, the court may also limit the number of requests under RCFC 36. The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties&rsquo; resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues. The court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion under RCFC 26(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) Trial Preparation: Materials.</strong> Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)(4), a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under subdivision (b)(1) of this rule and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that party. Upon request, a person not a party may obtain without the required showing a statement concerning the action or its subject matter previously made by that person. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement previously made is (A) a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or (B) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) Trial Preparation: Experts.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. If a report from the expert is required under subdivision (a)(2)(B), the deposition shall not be conducted until after the report is provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> A party may, through interrogatories or by deposition, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or prepa<!-- PDFPage:419 -->ration for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial only as provided in RCFC 35(b) or upon a showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> Unless manifest injustice would result, (i) the court shall require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to the discovery under this subdivision; and (ii) with respect to discovery obtained under subdivision (b)(4)(B) of this rule the court shall require the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5) Claims of Privilege or Protection of Trial Preparation Materials.</strong> When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable under these rules by claiming that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation material, the party shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Protective Orders.</strong> Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, accompanied by a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action, and for good cause shown, the court may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> that the disclosure or discovery not be had;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> that the disclosure or discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4)</strong> that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the disclosure or discovery be limited to certain matters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(5)</strong> that discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(6)</strong> that a deposition, after being sealed, be opened only by order of the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(7)</strong> that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a designated way; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(8)</strong> that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or other person provide or permit discovery. The provisions of RCFC 37(a)(4) apply to award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Timing and Sequence of Discovery.</strong> Except in categories of proceedings exempted from initial disclosure under RCFC 26(a)(1)(E), or when authorized under these rules or by order or agreement of the parties, a party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Appendix A &nbsp;3. Unless the court upon motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any sequence, and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, does not operate to delay any other party's discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Supplementation of Disclosures and Responses.</strong> A party who has made a disclosure under subdivision (a) or responded to a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> A party is under a duty to supplement at appropriate intervals its disclosures under subdivision (a) if the party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing. With respect to testimony of an expert from whom a report is required under subdivision (a)(2)(B) the duty extends both to information contained in the report and to information provided through a deposition of the expert.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Conference of Parties; Planning for Discovery.</strong> [Not used. See Appendix A &nbsp;3.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Signing of Disclosures, Discovery Requests, Responses, and Objections.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1)</strong> Every disclosure made pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) or Appendix A &nbsp;13, 15, and 16 shall be signed by the attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. An unrepresented party shall sign the disclosure and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the disclosure is complete and correct as of the time it is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2)</strong> Every discovery request, response, or objection made by a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by the attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated. An unrepresented party shall sign the request, response, or objection and state the party's address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a certification that to the best of <!-- PDFPage:420 -->the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, response, or objection is:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(A)</strong> consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(B)</strong> not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><strong>(C)</strong> not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3)</strong> If without substantial justification a certification is made in violation of the rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose behalf the disclosure, request, response, or objection is made, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Rules Committee Note</h4>
<p class="note-body">RCFC 26 has been revised to parallel the structure and content of its counterpart in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The limited number of changes to the current federal rule, as amended in 2000, reflect those deemed necessary to accommodate the nature and jurisdiction of this court. Except for these changes, the rule shown conforms fully to the text of FRCP 26. Because the Appendix A Early Meeting of Counsel substantially accomplishes the same purpose as the FRCP 26(f) conference of counsel, the timing of initial disclosures was keyed to the former. Consequently, in lieu of the language of FRCP 26(f), cross reference is made to Appendix A &nbsp;3.</p>
