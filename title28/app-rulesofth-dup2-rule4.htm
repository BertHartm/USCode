<p class="statutory-body">(5) After making service as prescribed in this subdivision (a), the clerk shall return a copy of the summons, together with proof of service and a receipt for payment of the filing fee, to the person who filed the summons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Summons and Complaint&mdash;Service by Plaintiff. In any action required to be commenced by the concurrent filing of a summons and complaint, the plaintiff shall cause service of the summons and complaint to be made in accordance with this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Service of a summons and complaint may be effected by any person who is not a party and who is at least 18 years of age. At the request of the plaintiff, however, the court may direct that service be effected by a United States marshal, deputy United States marshal, or other person or officer specially appointed by the court for that purpose. Such an appointment must be made when the plaintiff is authorized to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1915.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:430 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) In an action commenced under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1581(d), the court is authorized to serve the summons and complaint where the action was commenced <em>pro se</em> and the plaintiff has failed to make service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Waiver of Service; Duty to Save Costs of Service; Request to Waive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A defendant who waives service of a summons does not thereby waive any objection to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual, corporation, or association that is subject to service under subdivision (e), (f), or (h) and that receives notice of an action in the manner provided in this paragraph has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of serving the summons. To avoid costs, the plaintiff may notify such a defendant of the commencement of the action and request that the defendant waive service of a summons. The notice and request</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be in writing and shall be addressed directly to the defendant, if an individual, or else to an officer or managing or general agent (or other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service of process) of a defendant subject to service under subdivision (h);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be dispatched through first-class mail or other reliable means;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall be accompanied by a copy of the complaint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall inform the defendant, by means of a text substantially in the form as set forth in Forms 1A and 1B of the Appendix of Forms, of the consequences of compliance and of a failure to comply with the request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) shall set forth the date on which the request is sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) shall allow the defendant a reasonable time to return the waiver, which shall be at least 30 days from the date on which the request is sent, or 60 days from that date if the defendant is addressed outside any judicial district of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) shall provide the defendant with an extra copy of the notice and request, as well as a prepaid means of compliance in writing. If a defendant located within the United States fails to comply with a request for waiver made by a plaintiff located within the United States, the court shall impose the costs subsequently incurred in effecting service on the defendant unless good cause for the failure be shown.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A defendant that, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver so requested is not required to serve an answer to the complaint until 60 days after the date on which the request for waiver of service was sent, or 90 days after that date if the defendant was addressed outside any judicial district of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) When the plaintiff files a waiver of service with the court, the action shall proceed, except as provided in paragraph (3), as if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing the waiver, and no proof of service shall be required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The costs to be imposed on a defendant under paragraph (2) for failure to comply with a request to waive service of a summons shall include the costs subsequently incurred in effecting service under subdivision (e), (f), or (h), together with the costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, of any motion required to collect the costs of service.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Service Upon Individuals in a Foreign Country.

<p class="statutory-body">(k) Territorial Limits of Effective Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service is effective to establish jurisdiction over the person of a defendant</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) who is a party joined under USCIT R. 14 or 19 and is served at a place within a judicial district of the United States, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) when authorized by a statute of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service is also effective, with respect to claims arising under federal law, to establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Proof of Service. If service is not waived, the person effecting service shall make proof thereof to the court. If service is made by a person other than a United States marshal or deputy United States marshal, the person shall make affidavit thereof. Proof of service in a place not within any judicial district of the United States shall, if effected under paragraph (1) of subdivision (f), be made pursuant to the applicable treaty or convention, and shall, if effected under paragraph (2) or (3) thereof, include a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence of delivery to the addressee satisfactory to the court. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service. The court may allow proof of service to be amended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) Time Limit For Service. If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision does not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (f) or (j)(1).</p>
