<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">A close relationship exists between this rule and Rule 403 which requires exclusion when &ldquo;probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.&rdquo; The present rule recognizes the practice of admitting evidence for a limited purpose and instructing the jury accordingly. The availability and effectiveness of this practice must be taken into consideration in reaching a decision whether to exclude for unfair prejudice under Rule 403. In <em>Bruton v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 818, 88 S.Ct. 126, 19 L.Ed.2d 70 (1968), the Court ruled that a limiting instruction did not effectively protect the accused against the prejudicial effect of admitting in evidence the confession of a codefendant which implicated him. The decision does not, however, bar the use of limited admissibility with an instruction where the risk of prejudice is less serious.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions are found in Uniform Rule 6; California Evidence Code &sect;355; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure &sect;60&ndash;406; New Jersey Evidence Rule 6. The wording of the present rule differs, however, in repelling any implication that limiting or curative instructions are sufficient in all situations.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93&ndash;650</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 106 as submitted by the Supreme Court (now Rule 105 in the bill) dealt with the subject of evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but is not admissible against another party or for another purpose. The Committee adopted this Rule without change on the understanding that it does not affect the authority of a court to order a severance in a multi-defendant case.</p>
