<p class="note-body"><em>Prior section 506.&mdash;</em>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;511 (R.S. &sect;793; June 24, 1898, ch. 495, &sect;2, 30 Stat. 487; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;United States attorney&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;district attorney.&rdquo; (See Reviser's Note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;The Supreme Court of the Territory, and the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia&rdquo; were omitted as obsolete. This section, as revised, applies to all districts enumerated in chapter 5 of this title. There were no provisions respecting vacancies in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Therefore this section remedies this situation and establishes a uniform method to fill interim vacancies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and a copy shall be entered on the journal of the court&rdquo; after &ldquo;filed in the clerk's office of said court&rdquo;, in section 511 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of section 511 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to marshals, are incorporated in sections 544 and 545 [see Prior Provisions notes under those sections] of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
