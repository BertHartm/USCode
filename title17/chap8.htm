<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Appointment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Librarian of Congress shall appoint 3 full-time Copyright Royalty Judges, and shall appoint 1 of the 3 as the Chief Copyright Royalty Judge. The Librarian shall make appointments to such positions after consultation with the Register of Copyrights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Functions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the functions of the Copyright Royalty Judges shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To make determinations and adjustments of reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments as provided in sections 112(e), 114, 115, 116, 118, 119 and 1004. The rates applicable under sections 114(f)(1)(B), 115, and 116 shall be calculated to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) To maximize the availability of creative works to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) To afford the copyright owner a fair return for his or her creative work and the copyright user a fair income under existing economic conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and the copyright user in the product made available to the public with respect to relative creative contribution, technological contribution, capital in<!-- PDFPage:176 -->vestment, cost, risk, and contribution to the opening of new markets for creative expression and media for their communication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) To minimize any disruptive impact on the structure of the industries involved and on generally prevailing industry practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) national monetary inflation or deflation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) changes in the average rates charged cable subscribers for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant dollar level of the royalty fee per subscriber which existed as of the date of October 19, 1976,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) if the average rates charged cable system subscribers for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions are changed so that the average rates exceed national monetary inflation, no change in the rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) shall be permitted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) no increase in the royalty fee shall be permitted based on any reduction in the average number of distant signal equivalents per subscriber.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Copyright Royalty Judges may consider all factors relating to the maintenance of such level of payments, including, as an extenuating factor, whether the industry has been restrained by subscriber rate regulating authorities from increasing the rates for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the event that the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission are amended at any time after April 15, 1976, to permit the carriage by cable systems of additional television broadcast signals beyond the local service area of the primary transmitters of such signals, the royalty rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to ensure that the rates for the additional distant signal equivalents resulting from such carriage are reasonable in the light of the changes effected by the amendment to such rules and regulations. In determining the reasonableness of rates proposed following an amendment of Federal Communications Commission rules and regulations, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall consider, among other factors, the economic impact on copyright owners and users; except that no adjustment in royalty rates shall be made under this subparagraph with respect to any distant signal equivalent or fraction thereof represented by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) carriage of any signal permitted under the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976, or the carriage of a signal of the same type (that is, independent, network, or noncommercial educational) substituted for such permitted signal; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a television broadcast signal first carried after April 15, 1976, pursuant to an individual waiver of the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, as such rules and regulations were in effect on April 15, 1976.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The gross receipts limitations established by section 111(d)(1)(C) and (D) shall be adjusted to reflect national monetary inflation or deflation or changes in the average rates charged cable system subscribers for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant dollar value of the exemption provided by such section, and the royalty rate specified therein shall not be subject to adjustment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In cases where the Copyright Royalty Judges determine that controversy exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall determine the distribution of such fees, including partial distributions, in accordance with section 111, 119, or 1007, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Copyright Royalty Judges may make a partial distribution of such fees during the pendency of the proceeding under subparagraph (B) if all participants under section 803(b)(2) in the proceeding that are entitled to receive those fees that are to be partially distributed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) agree to such partial distribution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) sign an agreement obligating them to return any excess amounts to the extent necessary to comply with the final determination on the distribution of the fees made under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) file the agreement with the Copyright Royalty Judges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) agree that such funds are available for distribution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Copyright Royalty Judges and any other officer or employee acting in good faith in distributing funds under subparagraph (C) shall not be held liable for the payment of any excess fees under subparagraph (C). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall, at the time the final determination is made, calculate any such excess amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To accept or reject royalty claims filed under sections 111, 119, and 1007, on the basis of timeliness or the failure to establish the basis for a claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To accept or reject rate adjustment petitions as provided in section 804 and petitions <!-- PDFPage:177 -->to participate as provided in section 803(b) (1) and (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7)(A) To adopt as a basis for statutory terms and rates or as a basis for the distribution of statutory royalty payments, an agreement concerning such matters reached among some or all of the participants in a proceeding at any time during the proceeding, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Copyright Royalty Judges shall provide to those that would be bound by the terms, rates, or other determination set by any agreement in a proceeding to determine royalty rates an opportunity to comment on the agreement and shall provide to participants in the proceeding under section 803(b)(2) that would be bound by the terms, rates, or other determination set by the agreement an opportunity to comment on the agreement and object to its adoption as a basis for statutory terms and rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Copyright Royalty Judges may decline to adopt the agreement as a basis for statutory terms and rates for participants that are not parties to the agreement, if any participant described in clause (i) objects to the agreement and the Copyright Royalty Judges conclude, based on the record before them if one exists, that the agreement does not provide a reasonable basis for setting statutory terms or rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) License agreements voluntarily negotiated pursuant to section 112(e)(5), 114(f)(3), 115(c)(3)(E)(i), 116(c), or 118(b)(2) that do not result in statutory terms and rates shall not be subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).</p>

<!-- PDFPage:179 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In making determinations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(i) Subject to clause (ii) of this subparagraph and subparagraph (B), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall have full independence in making determinations concerning adjustments and determinations of copyright royalty rates and terms, the distribution of copyright royalties, the acceptance or rejection of royalty claims, rate adjustment petitions, and petitions to participate, and in issuing other rulings under this title, except that the Copyright Royalty Judges may consult with the Register of Copyrights on any matter other than a question of fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A Copyright Royalty Judge or Judges, or, by motion to the Copyright Royalty Judge or Judges, any participant in a proceeding may request an interpretation by the Register of Copyrights concerning any material question of substantive law (not including questions of procedure before the Copyright Royalty Judges, the ultimate adjustments and determinations of copyright royalty rates and terms, the ultimate distribution of copyright royalties, or the acceptance or rejection of royalty claims, rate adjustment petitions, or petitions to participate) concerning an interpretation or construction of those provisions of this title that are the subject of the proceeding. Any such request for a written interpretation by the Register of Copyrights shall be on the record. Reasonable provision shall be made for comment by the participants in the proceeding on the material question of substantive law in such a way as to minimize duplication and delay. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Register of Copyrights shall deliver to the Copyright Royalty Judges a response within 14 days after the Register of Copyrigts&nbsp;<sup><a href="#802_1_target" name="802_1">1</a></sup> receives all of the briefs or comments of the participants. Such decision shall be in writing and shall be included by the Copyright Royalty Judges in the record that accompanies their final determination. If such a decision is timely delivered to the Copyright Royalty Judges, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall apply the legal interpretation embodied in the response of the Register of Copyrights in resolving material questions of substantive law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Novel questions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(i) In any case in which a novel material question of substantive law concerning an interpretation of those provisions of this title that are the subject of the proceeding is presented, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall request a decision of the Register of Copyrights, in writing, to resolve such novel question. Reasonable provision shall be made for comment on such request by the participants in the proceeding, in such a way as to minimize duplication and delay. The Register of Copyrights shall transmit his or her decision to the Copyright Royalty Judges within 30 days after the Register of Copyrights receives all of the briefs or comments of the participants. Such decision shall be in writing and included by the Copyright Royalty Judges in the record that accompanies their final determination. If such a decision is timely delivered to the Copyright Royalty Judges, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall apply the legal determinations embodied in the decision of the Register of Copyrights in resolving material questions of substantive law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In clause (i), a &ldquo;novel question of law&rdquo; is a question of law that has not been determined in prior decisions, determinations, and rulings described in section 803(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall consult with the Register of Copyrights with respect to any determination or ruling that would require that any act be performed by the Copyright Office, and any such determination or ruling shall not be binding upon the Register of Copyrights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Review of legal conclusions by the register of copyrights</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Register of Copyrights may review for legal error the resolution by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a material question of substantive law under this title that underlies or is contained in a final determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges. If the Register of Copyrights concludes, after taking into consideration the views of the participants in the proceeding, that any resolution reached by the Copyright Royalty Judges was in material error, the Register of Copyrights shall issue a written decision correcting such legal error, which shall be made part of the record of the proceeding. The Register of Copyrights shall issue such written decision not later than 60 days after the date on which the final determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges is issued. Additionally, the Register of Copyrights shall cause to be published in the Federal Register such written decision, together with a specific identification of the legal conclusion of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is determined to be erroneous. As to conclusions of substantive law involving an interpretation of the statutory provisions of this title, the decision of the Register of Copyrights shall be binding as precedent upon the Copyright Royalty Judges in subsequent proceedings under this chapter. When a decision has been rendered pursuant to this subparagraph, the Register of Copyrights may, on the basis of and in accordance with such decision, intervene as of right in any appeal of a final determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges pursuant to section 803(d) in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If, prior to intervening in such an appeal, the Register of Copyrights gives notification to, and undertakes to consult with the Attorney General with respect to such intervention, and the Attorney General fails, within a reasonable period after receiving such notification, to intervene in such appeal, the Register of Copyrights may intervene in such appeal in his or her own name by any attorney des<!-- PDFPage:180 -->ignated by the Register of Copyrights for such purpose. Intervention by the Register of Copyrights in his or her own name shall not preclude the Attorney General from intervening on behalf of the United States in such an appeal as may be otherwise provided or required by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Effect on judicial review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to alter the standard applied by a court in reviewing legal determinations involving an interpretation or construction of the provisions of this title or to affect the extent to which any construction or interpretation of the provisions of this title shall be accorded deference by a reviewing court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Performance appraisals.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any regulation of the Library of Congress, and subject to subparagraph (B), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall not receive performance appraisals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Relating to sanction or removal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent that the Librarian of Congress adopts regulations under subsection (h) relating to the sanction or removal of a Copyright Royalty Judge and such regulations require documentation to establish the cause of such sanction or removal, the Copyright Royalty Judge may receive an appraisal related specifically to the cause of the sanction or removal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Inconsistent Duties Barred</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No Copyright Royalty Judge may undertake duties that conflict with his or her duties and responsibilities as a Copyright Royalty Judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Standards of Conduct</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Librarian of Congress shall adopt regulations regarding the standards of conduct, including financial conflict of interest and restrictions against ex parte communications, which shall govern the Copyright Royalty Judges and the proceedings under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Removal or Sanction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Librarian of Congress may sanction or remove a Copyright Royalty Judge for violation of the standards of conduct adopted under subsection (h), misconduct, neglect of duty, or any disqualifying physical or mental disability. Any such sanction or removal may be made only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, but the Librarian of Congress may suspend the Copyright Royalty Judge during the pendency of such hearing. The Librarian shall appoint an interim Copyright Royalty Judge during the period of any such suspension.</p>

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, petitioners whose petitions are filed more than 30 days after publication of notice of commencement of a proceeding are not eligible to object to a settlement reached during the voluntary negotiation period under paragraph (3), and any objection filed by such a petitioner shall not be taken into account by the Copyright Royalty Judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Petitions to participate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each petition to participate in a proceeding shall describe the petitioner's interest in the subject matter of the proceeding. Parties with similar interests may file a single petition to participate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Determination of subsequent proceedings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the close of the voluntary negotiation proceedings, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, if further proceedings under this chapter are necessary, determine whether and to what extent paragraphs (4) and (5) will apply to the parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Small claims procedure in distribution proceedings.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in a proceeding under this chapter to determine the distribution of royalties, the contested amount of a claim is $10,000 or less, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall decide the controversy on the basis of the filing of the written direct statement by the participant, the response by any opposing participant, and 1 additional response by each such party. The participant asserting the claim shall not be required to pay the filing fee under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Bad faith inflation of claim</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Copyright Royalty Judges determine that a participant asserts in bad faith an amount in controversy in excess of $10,000 for the purpose of avoiding a determination under the procedure set forth in subparagraph (A), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall impose a fine on that participant in an amount not to exceed the difference between the actual amount distributed and the amount asserted by the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Paper proceedings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Copyright Royalty Judges in proceedings under this chapter may decide, sua sponte or upon motion of a participant, to determine issues on the basis of the filing of the written direct statement by the participant, the response by any opposing participant, and one additional response by each such participant. Prior to making such decision to proceed on such a paper record only, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall offer to all parties to the proceeding the opportunity to comment on the decision. The procedure under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be applied in cases in which there is no genuine issue of material fact, there is no need for evidentiary hearings, and all participants in the proceeding agree in writing to the procedure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may be applied under such other circumstances as the Copyright Royalty Judges consider appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Regulations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue regulations to carry out their functions under this title. All regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges are subject to the approval of the Librarian of Congress. Not later than 120 days after Copyright Royalty Judges or interim Copyright Royalty Judges, as the case may be, are first appointed after the enactment of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, such judges shall issue regulations to govern proceedings under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Interim regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Until regulations are adopted under subparagraph (A), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall apply the regulations in effect under this chapter on the day before the effective date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, to the extent such regulations are not inconsistent with this chapter, except that functions carried out under such regulations by the Librarian of Congress, the Register of Copyrights, or copyright arbitra<!-- PDFPage:182 -->tion royalty panels that, as of such date of enactment, are to be carried out by the Copyright Royalty Judges under this chapter, shall be carried out by the Copyright Royalty Judges under such regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Regulations issued under subparagraph (A) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The written direct statements of all participants in a proceeding under paragraph (2) shall be filed by a date specified by the Copyright Royalty Judges, which may be not earlier than 4 months, and not later than 5 months, after the end of the voluntary negotiation period under paragraph (3). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Copyright Royalty Judges may allow a participant in a proceeding to file an amended written direct statement based on new information received during the discovery process, within 15 days after the end of the discovery period specified in clause (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) Following the submission to the Copyright Royalty Judges of written direct statements by the participants in a proceeding under paragraph (2), the judges shall meet with the participants for the purpose of setting a schedule for conducting and completing discovery. Such schedule shall be determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) In this chapter, the term &ldquo;written direct statements&rdquo; means witness statements, testimony, and exhibits to be presented in the proceedings, and such other information that is necessary to establish terms and rates, or the distribution of royalty payments, as the case may be, as set forth in regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty Judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Hearsay may be admitted in proceedings under this chapter to the extent deemed appropriate by the Copyright Royalty Judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Discovery in such proceedings shall be permitted for a period of 60 days, except for discovery ordered by the Copyright Royalty Judges in connection with the resolution of motions, orders, and disputes pending at the end of such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding under this chapter to determine royalty rates may request of an opposing participant nonprivileged documents directly related to the written direct statement or written rebuttal statement of that participant. Any objection to such a request shall be resolved by a motion or request to compel production made to the Copyright Royalty Judges in accordance with regulations adopted by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Each motion or request to compel discovery shall be determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges, or by a Copyright Royalty Judge when permitted under subsection (a)(2). Upon such motion, the Copyright Royalty Judges may order discovery pursuant to regulations established under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi)(I) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding under this chapter to determine royalty rates may, by means of written motion or on the record, request of an opposing participant or witness other relevant information and materials if, absent the discovery sought, the Copyright Royalty Judges&rsquo; resolution of the proceeding would be substantially impaired. In determining whether discovery will be granted under this clause, the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) whether the burden or expense of producing the requested information or materials outweighs the likely benefit, taking into account the needs and resources of the participants, the importance of the issues at stake, and the probative value of the requested information or materials in resolving such issues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) whether the requested information or materials would be unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or are obtainable from another source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(cc) whether the participant seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the proceeding or by other means to obtain the information sought.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) This clause shall not apply to any proceeding scheduled to commence after December 31, 2010.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) In a proceeding under this chapter to determine royalty rates, the participants entitled to receive royalties shall collectively be permitted to take no more than 10 depositions and secure responses to no more than 25 interrogatories, and the participants obligated to pay royalties shall collectively be permitted to take no more than 10 depositions and secure responses to no more than 25 interrogatories. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall resolve any disputes among similarly aligned participants to allocate the number of depositions or interrogatories permitted under this clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) The rules and practices in effect on the day before the effective date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, relating to discovery in proceedings under this chapter to determine the distribution of royalty fees, shall continue to apply to such proceedings on and after such effective date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) In proceedings to determine royalty rates, the Copyright Royalty Judges may issue a subpoena commanding a participant or witness to appear and give testimony, or to produce and permit inspection of documents or tangible things, if the Copyright Royalty Judges&rsquo; resolution of the proceeding would be substantially impaired by the absence of such testimony or production of documents or tangible things. Such subpoena shall specify with reasonable particularity the materials to be produced or the scope and nature of the required testimony. Nothing in this clause shall preclude the Copyright Royalty Judges from requesting the production by <!-- PDFPage:183 -->a nonparticipant of information or materials relevant to the resolution by the Copyright Royalty Judges of a material issue of fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall order a settlement conference among the participants in the proceeding to facilitate the presentation of offers of settlement among the participants. The settlement conference shall be held during a 21-day period following the end of the discovery period and shall take place outside the presence of the Copyright Royalty Judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xi) No evidence, including exhibits, may be submitted in the written direct statement or written rebuttal statement of a participant without a sponsoring witness, except where the Copyright Royalty Judges have taken official notice, or in the case of incorporation by reference of past records, or for good cause shown.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Copyright Royalty Judges.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Timing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue their determination in a proceeding not later than 11 months after the conclusion of the 21-day settlement conference period under subsection (b)(6)(C)(x), but, in the case of a proceeding to determine successors to rates or terms that expire on a specified date, in no event later than 15 days before the expiration of the then current statutory rates and terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Rehearings.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Copyright Royalty Judges may, in exceptional cases, upon motion of a participant in a proceeding under subsection (b)(2), order a rehearing, after the determination in the proceeding is issued under paragraph (1), on such matters as the Copyright Royalty Judges determine to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Timing for filing motion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any motion for a rehearing under subparagraph (A) may only be filed within 15 days after the date on which the Copyright Royalty Judges deliver to the participants in the proceeding their initial determination concerning rates and terms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Participation by opposing party not required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any case in which a rehearing is ordered, any opposing party shall not be required to participate in the rehearing, except that nonparticipation may give rise to the limitations with respect to judicial review provided for in subsection (d)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>No negative inference</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No negative inference shall be drawn from lack of participation in a rehearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Continuity of rates and terms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(i) If the decision of the Copyright Royalty Judges on any motion for a rehearing is not rendered before the expiration of the statutory rates and terms that were previously in effect, in the case of a proceeding to determine successors to rates and terms that expire on a specified date, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is the subject of the rehearing motion shall be effective as of the day following the date on which the rates and terms that were previously in effect expire; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) in the case of a proceeding under section 114(f)(1)(C) or 114(f)(2)(C), royalty rates and terms shall, for purposes of section 114(f)(4)(B), be deemed to have been set at those rates and terms contained in the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is the subject of the rehearing motion, as of the date of that determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The pendency of a motion for a rehearing under this paragraph shall not relieve persons obligated to make royalty payments who would be affected by the determination on that motion from providing the statements of account and any reports of use, to the extent required, and paying the royalties required under the relevant determination or regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), whenever royalties described in clause (ii) are paid to a person other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60 days after the motion for rehearing is resolved or, if the motion is granted, within 60 days after the rehearing is concluded, return any excess amounts previously paid to the extent necessary to comply with the final determination of royalty rates by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Any underpayment of royalties resulting from a rehearing shall be paid within the same period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Contents of determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges shall be supported by the written record and shall set forth the findings of fact relied on by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Among other terms adopted in a determination, the Copyright Royalty Judges may specify notice and recordkeeping requirements of users of the copyrights at issue that apply in lieu of those that would otherwise apply under regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Continuing jurisdiction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Copyright Royalty Judges may, with the approval of the Register of Copyrights, issue an amendment to a written determination to correct any technical or clerical errors in the determination or to modify the terms, but not the rates, of royalty payments in response to unforeseen circumstances that would frustrate the proper implementation of such determination. Such amendment shall be set forth in a written addendum to the determination that shall be distributed to the participants of the proceeding and shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Protective order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue such orders as may be appropriate to protect confidential information, including orders excluding confidential information from the record of the determination that is published or made available to the public, except that any terms or rates of royalty payments or distributions may not be excluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Publication of determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;By no later than the end of the 60-day period pro<!-- PDFPage:184 -->vided in section 802(f)(1)(D), the Librarian of Congress shall cause the determination, and any corrections thereto, to be published in the Federal Register.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Appeal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges under subsection (c) may, within 30 days after the publication of the determination in the Federal Register, be appealed, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by any aggrieved participant in the proceeding under subsection (b)(2) who fully participated in the proceeding and who would be bound by the determination. Any participant that did not participate in a rehearing may not raise any issue that was the subject of that rehearing at any stage of judicial review of the hearing determination. If no appeal is brought within that 30-day period, the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges shall be final, and the royalty fee or determination with respect to the distribution of fees, as the case may be, shall take effect as set forth in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Effect of rates.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Expiration on specified date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When this title provides that the royalty rates and terms that were previously in effect are to expire on a specified date, any adjustment or determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges of successor rates and terms for an ensuing statutory license period shall be effective as of the day following the date of expiration of the rates and terms that were previously in effect, even if the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges is rendered on a later date. A licensee shall be obligated to continue making payments under the rates and terms previously in effect until such time as rates and terms for the successor period are established. Whenever royalties pursuant to this section are paid to a person other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60 days after the final determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges establishing rates and terms for a successor period or the exhaustion of all rehearings or appeals of such determination, if any, return any excess amounts previously paid to the extent necessary to comply with the final determination of royalty rates. Any underpayment of royalties by a copyright user shall be paid to the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges within the same period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Other cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In cases where rates and terms have not, prior to the inception of an activity, been established for that particular activity under the relevant license, such rates and terms shall be retroactive to the inception of activity under the relevant license covered by such rates and terms. In other cases where rates and terms do not expire on a specified date, successor rates and terms shall take effect on the first day of the second month that begins after the publication of the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges in the Federal Register, except as otherwise provided in this title, or by the Copyright Royalty Judges, or as agreed by the participants in a proceeding that would be bound by the rates and terms. Except as otherwise provided in this title, the rates and terms, to the extent applicable, shall remain in effect until such successor rates and terms become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Obligation to make payments.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The pendency of an appeal under this subsection shall not relieve persons obligated to make royalty payments under section 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, 119, or 1003, who would be affected by the determination on appeal, from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) providing the statements of account and any report of use; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) paying the royalties required under the relevant determination or regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), whenever royalties described in clause (i) are paid to a person other than the Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60 days after the final resolution of the appeal, return any excess amounts previously paid (and interest thereon, if ordered pursuant to paragraph (3)) to the extent necessary to comply with the final determination of royalty rates on appeal. Any underpayment of royalties resulting from an appeal (and interest thereon, if ordered pursuant to paragraph (3)) shall be paid within the same period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Jurisdiction of court</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court, pursuant to section 706 of title 5, modifies or vacates a determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges, the court may enter its own determination with respect to the amount or distribution of royalty fees and costs, and order the repayment of any excess fees, the payment of any underpaid fees, and the payment of interest pertaining respectively thereto, in accordance with its final judgment. The court may also vacate the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges and remand the case to the Copyright Royalty Judges for further proceedings in accordance with subsection (a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Administrative Matters.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Deduction of costs of library of congress and copyright office from filing fees.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<!-- PDFPage:185 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Deduction from filing fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Librarian of Congress may, to the extent not otherwise provided under this title, deduct from the filing fees collected under subsection (b) for a particular proceeding under this chapter the reasonable costs incurred by the Librarian of Congress, the Copyright Office, and the Copyright Royalty Judges in conducting that proceeding, other than the salaries of the Copyright Royalty Judges and the 3 staff members appointed under section 802(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to pay the costs incurred under this chapter not covered by the filing fees collected under subsection (b). All funds made available pursuant to this subparagraph shall remain available until expended.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Positions required for administration of compulsory licensing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 307 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1994, shall not apply to employee positions in the Library of Congress that are required to be filled in order to carry out section 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 118, or 119 or chapter 10.</p>
