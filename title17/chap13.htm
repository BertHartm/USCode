<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Designs Protected.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The designer or other owner of an original design of a useful article which makes the article attractive or distinctive in appearance to the purchasing or using public may secure the protection provided by this chapter upon complying with and subject to this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Vessel hulls</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The design of a vessel hull, including a plug or mold, is subject to protection under this chapter, notwithstanding section 1302(4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A design is &ldquo;original&rdquo; if it is the result of the designer's creative endeavor that provides a distinguishable variation over prior work pertaining to similar articles which is more than merely trivial and has not been copied from another source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A &ldquo;useful article&rdquo; is a vessel hull, including a plug or mold, which in normal use has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. An article which normally is part of a useful article shall be deemed to be a useful article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; is a craft&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that is designed and capable of independently steering a course on or through water through its own means of propulsion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that is designed and capable of carrying and transporting one or more passengers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A &ldquo;hull&rdquo; is the frame or body of a vessel, including the deck of a vessel, exclusive of masts, sails, yards, and rigging.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A &ldquo;plug&rdquo; means a device or model used to make a mold for the purpose of exact duplication, regardless of whether the device or model has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A &ldquo;mold&rdquo; means a matrix or form in which a substance for material is used, regardless of whether the matrix or form has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey information.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Acts of Infringement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (b), it shall be infringement of the exclusive rights in a design protected under this chapter for any person, without the consent of the owner of the design, within the United States and during the term of such protection, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make, have made, or import, for sale or for use in trade, any infringing article as defined in subsection (e); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) sell or distribute for sale or for use in trade any such infringing article.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Acts of Sellers and Distributors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A seller or distributor of an infringing article who did not make or import the article shall be deemed to have infringed on a design protected under this chapter only if that person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) induced or acted in collusion with a manufacturer to make, or an importer to import such article, except that merely purchasing or giving an order to purchase such article in the ordinary course of business shall not of itself constitute such inducement or collusion; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) refused or failed, upon the request of the owner of the design, to make a prompt and full disclosure of that person's source of such article, and that person orders or reorders such article after receiving notice by registered or certified mail of the protection subsisting in the design.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Acts Without Knowledge</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It shall not be infringement under this section to make, have made, import, sell, or distribute, any article embodying a design which was created without knowledge that a design was protected under this chapter and was copied from such protected design.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Acts in Ordinary Course of Business</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who incorporates into that person's product of manufacture an infringing article acquired from others in the ordinary course of business, or who, without knowledge of the protected design embodied in an infringing article, makes or processes the infringing article for the account of another person in the ordinary course of business, shall not be deemed to have infringed the rights in that design under this chapter except under a condition contained in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b). Accepting an order or reorder from the source of the infringing article shall be deemed ordering or reordering within the meaning of subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Infringing Article Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As used in this section, an &ldquo;infringing article&rdquo; is any article the design of which has been copied from a design protected under this chapter, without the consent of the owner of the protected design. An infringing article is not an illustration or picture of a protected design in an advertisement, book, periodical, newspaper, photograph, broadcast, motion picture, or similar medium. A design shall not be deemed to have been copied from a protected design if it is original and not substantially similar in appearance to a protected design.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Establishing Originality</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The party to any action or proceeding under this chapter who alleges rights under this chapter in a design shall have the burden of establishing the design's originality whenever the opposing party introduces an earlier work which is identical to such design, or so similar as to make prima facie showing that such design was copied from such work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Reproduction for Teaching or Analysis</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is not an infringement of the exclusive rights of a design owner for a person to reproduce the design in a useful article or in any other form solely for the purpose of teaching, analyzing, or evaluating the appearance, concepts, or techniques embodied in the design, or the function of the useful article embodying the design.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Errors in omitting a joint designer or in naming an alleged joint designer shall not affect the validity of the registration, or the actual ownership or the protection of the design, unless it is shown that the error occurred with deceptive intent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Design Made in Scope of Employment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a case in which the design was made within the regular scope of the designer's employment and individual authorship of the design is difficult or impossible to ascribe and the application so states, the name and address of the employer for whom the design was made may be stated instead of that of the individual designer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Pictorial Representation of Design</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The application for registration shall be accompanied by two copies of a drawing or other pictorial representation of the useful article embodying the design, having one or more views, adequate to show the design, in a form and style suitable for reproduction, which shall be deemed a part of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Design in More Than One Useful Article</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the distinguishing elements of a design are in substantially the same form in different useful articles, the design shall be protected as to all such useful articles when protected as to one of them, but not more than one registration shall be required for the design.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Application for More Than One Design</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;More than one design may be included in the same application under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator.

Registration under this subsection shall be announced by publication. The date of registration shall be the date of publication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Refusal To Register; Reconsideration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in the judgment of the Administrator, the application for registration relates to a design which on its face is not subject to protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall send to the applicant a notice of refusal to register and the grounds for the refusal. Within 3 months after the date on which the notice of refusal is sent, the applicant may, by written request, seek reconsideration of the application.

Upon receipt of an application for cancellation, the Administrator shall send to the owner of the design, as shown in the records of the Office of the Administrator, a notice of the application, and the owner shall have a period of 3 months after the date on which such notice is mailed in which to present arguments to the Administrator for support of the validity of the registration. The Administrator shall also have the authority to establish, by regulation, conditions under which the opposing parties may appear and be heard in support of their arguments. If, after the periods provided for the presentation of arguments have expired, the Administrator determines that the applicant for cancellation has established that the design is not subject to protection under this chapter, the Administrator shall order the registration stricken from the record. Cancellation under this subsection shall be announced by publication, and notice of the Administrator's final determination with respect to any application for cancellation shall be sent to the applicant and to the owner of record.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The owner of a design is entitled, after issuance of a certificate of registration of the design under this chapter, to institute an action for any infringement of the design.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review of Refusal To Register</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the owner of a design may seek judicial review of a final refusal of the Administrator to register the design under this chapter by bringing a civil action, and may in the same action, if the court adjudges the design subject to protection under this chapter, enforce the rights in that design under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The owner of a design may seek judicial review under this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the owner has previously duly filed and prosecuted to final refusal an application in proper form for registration of the design;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner causes a copy of the complaint in the action to be delivered to the Administrator within 10 days after the commencement of the action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the defendant has committed acts in respect to the design which would constitute infringement with respect to a design protected under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Administrator as Party to Action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may, at the Administrator's option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the design claim by entering an appearance within 60 days after being served with the complaint, but the failure of the Administrator to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Use of Arbitration To Resolve Dispute</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The parties to an infringement dispute under this chapter, within such time as may be specified by the Administrator by regulation, may determine the dispute, or any aspect of the dispute, by arbitration. Arbitration shall be governed by title 9. The parties shall give notice of any arbitration award to the Administrator, and such award shall, as between the parties to the arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it relates. The arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice is given. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Administrator from determining whether a design is subject to registration in a cancellation proceeding under section 1313(c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Damages</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon a finding for the claimant in an action for infringement under this chapter, the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement. In <!-- PDFPage:200 -->addition, the court may increase the damages to such amount, not exceeding $50,000 or $1 per copy, whichever is greater, as the court determines to be just.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Infringer's Profits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As an alternative to the remedies provided in subsection (a), the court may award the claimant the infringer's profits resulting from the sale of the copies if the court finds that the infringer's sales are reasonably related to the use of the claimant's design. In such a case, the claimant shall be required to prove only the amount of the infringer's sales and the infringer shall be required to prove its expenses against such sales.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Statute of Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No recovery under subsection (a) or (b) shall be had for any infringement committed more than 3 years before the date on which the complaint is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Attorney's Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In an action for infringement under this chapter, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party.</p>
