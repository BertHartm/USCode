<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A design is &ldquo;original&rdquo; if it is the result of the designer's creative endeavor that provides a distinguishable variation over prior work pertaining to similar articles which is more than merely trivial and has not been copied from another source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A &ldquo;useful article&rdquo; is a vessel hull, including a plug or mold, which in normal use has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A &ldquo;plug&rdquo; means a device or model used to make a mold for the purpose of exact duplication, regardless of whether the device or model has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A &ldquo;mold&rdquo; means a matrix or form in which a substance for material is used, regardless of whether the matrix or form has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey information.</p>
