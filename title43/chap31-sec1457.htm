<p class="note-body">Geographic information is critical to promote economic development, improve our stewardship of natu<!-- PDFPage:338 -->ral resources, and protect the environment. Modern technology now permits improved acquisition, distribution, and utilization of geographic (or geospatial) data and mapping. The National Performance Review has recommended that the executive branch develop, in cooperation with State, local, and tribal governments, and the private sector, a coordinated National Spatial Data Infrastructure to support public and private sector applications of geospatial data in such areas as transportation, community development, agriculture, emergency response, environmental management, and information technology.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America; and to implement the recommendations of the National Performance Review; to advance the goals of the National Information Infrastructure; and to avoid wasteful duplication of effort and promote effective and economical management of resources by Federal, State, local, and tribal governments, it is ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. DEFINITIONS. (a) &ldquo;National Spatial Data Infrastructure&rdquo; (&ldquo;NSDI&rdquo;) means the technology, policies, standards, and human resources necessary to acquire, process, store, distribute, and improve utilization of geospatial data.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Geospatial data&rdquo; means information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the earth. This information may be derived from, among other things, remote sensing, mapping, and surveying technologies. Statistical data may be included in this definition at the discretion of the collecting agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The &ldquo;National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse&rdquo; means a distributed network of geospatial data producers, managers, and users linked electronically.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. EXECUTIVE BRANCH LEADERSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE COORDINATED NATIONAL SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. (a) The Federal Geographic Data Committee (&ldquo;FGDC&rdquo;), established by the Office of Management and Budget (&ldquo;OMB&rdquo;) Circular No. A&ndash;16 (&ldquo;Coordination of Surveying, Mapping, and Related Spatial Data Activities&rdquo;) and chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) or the Secretary's designee, shall coordinate the Federal Government's development of the NSDI.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each member agency shall ensure that its representative on the FGDC holds a policy-level position.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Executive branch departments and agencies (&ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) that have an interest in the development of the NSDI are encouraged to join the FGDC.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This Executive order is intended to strengthen and enhance the general policies described in OMB Circular No. A&ndash;16. Each agency shall meet its respective responsibilities under OMB Circular No. A&ndash;16.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The FGDC shall seek to involve State, local, and tribal governments in the development and implementation of the initiatives contained in this order. The FGDC shall utilize the expertise of academia, the private sector, professional societies, and others as necessary to aid in the development and implementation of the objectives of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL DATA CLEARINGHOUSE. (a) <em>Establishing a National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse</em>. The Secretary, through the FGDC, and in consultation with, as appropriate, State, local, and tribal governments and other affected parties, shall take steps within 6 months of the date of this order, to establish an electronic National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (&ldquo;Clearinghouse&rdquo;) for the NSDI. The Clearinghouse shall be compatible with the National Information Infrastructure to enable integration with that effort.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Standardized Documentation of Data</em>. Beginning 9 months from the date of this order, each agency shall document all new geospatial data it collects or produces, either directly or indirectly, using the standard under development by the FGDC, and make that standardized documentation electronically accessible to the Clearinghouse network. Within 1 year of the date of this order, agencies shall adopt a schedule, developed in consultation with the FGDC, for documenting, to the extent practicable, geospatial data previously collected or produced, either directly or indirectly, and making that data documentation electronically accessible to the Clearinghouse network.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Public Access to Geospatial Data</em>. Within 1 year of the date of this order, each agency shall adopt a plan, in consultation with the FGDC, establishing procedures to make geospatial data available to the public, to the extent permitted by law, current policies, and relevant OMB circulars, including OMB Circular No. A&ndash;130 (&ldquo;Management of Federal Information Resources&rdquo;) and any implementing bulletins.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Agency Utilization of the Clearinghouse</em>. Within 1 year of the date of this order, each agency shall adopt internal procedures to ensure that the agency accesses the Clearinghouse before it expends Federal funds to collect or produce new geospatial data, to determine whether the information has already been collected by others, or whether cooperative efforts to obtain the data are possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) <em>Funding</em>. The Department of the Interior shall provide funding for the Clearinghouse to cover the initial prototype testing, standards development, and monitoring of the performance of the Clearinghouse. Agencies shall continue to fund their respective programs that collect and produce geospatial data; such data is then to be made part of the Clearinghouse for wider accessibility.</p>
