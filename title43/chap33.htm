<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) there is an immediate need for a fair and just settlement of all claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska, based on aboriginal land claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) the settlement should be accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in conformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives, without litigation, with maximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their rights and property, without establishing any permanent racially defined institutions, rights, privileges, or obligations, without creating a reservation system or lengthy wardship or trusteeship, and without adding to the categories of property and institutions enjoying special tax privileges or to the legislation establishing special relationships between the United States Government and the State of Alaska;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) no provision of this chapter shall replace or diminish any right, privilege, or obligation of Natives as citizens of the United States or of Alaska, or relieve, replace, or diminish any obligation of the United States or of the State or Alaska to protect and promote the rights or welfare of Natives as citizens of the United States or of Alaska; the Secretary is authorized and directed, together with other appropriate agencies of the United States Government, to make a study of all Federal programs primarily designed to benefit Native people and to report back to the Congress with his recommendations for the future management and operation of these programs within three years of December 18, 1971;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) no provision of this chapter shall constitute a precedent for reopening, renegotiating, or legislating upon any past settlement involving land claims or other matters with any Native organizations, or any tribe, band, or identifiable group of American Indians;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) no provision of this chapter shall effect a change or changes in the petroleum reserve policy reflected in sections 7421 through 7438&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1601_1_target" name="1601_1">1</a></sup> of title 10 except as specifically provided in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) no provision of this chapter shall be construed to constitute a jurisdictional act, to confer jurisdiction to sue, nor to grant implied consent to Natives to sue the United States or any of its officers with respect to the claims extinguished by the operation of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(g) no provision of this chapter shall be construed to terminate or otherwise curtail the activities of the Economic Development Administration or other Federal agencies conducting loan or loan and grant programs in Alaska. For this purpose only, the terms &ldquo;Indian reservation&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust or restricted Indian-owned land areas&rdquo; in Public Law 89&ndash;136, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended [42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq.], shall be interpreted to include lands granted to Natives under this chapter as long as such lands remain in the ownership of the Native villages or the Regional Corporations.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;241, &sect;2, Feb. 3, 1988, 101 Stat. 1788, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [this chapter] was enacted in 1971 to achieve a fair and just settlement of all aboriginal land and hunting and fishing claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska with maximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their rights and property;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the settlement enabled Natives to participate in the subsequent expansion of Alaska's economy, encouraged efforts to address serious health and welfare problems in Native villages, and sparked a resurgence of interest in the cultural heritage of the Native peoples of Alaska;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) despite these achievements and Congress's desire that the settlement be accomplished rapidly without litigation and in conformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives, the complexity of the land conveyance process and frequent and costly litigation have delayed implementation of the settlement and diminished its value;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Natives have differing opinions as to whether the Native Corporation, as originally structured by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, is well adapted to the reality of life in Native villages and to the continuation of traditional Native cultural values;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to ensure the continued success of the settlement and to guarantee Natives continued participation in decisions affecting their rights and property, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act must be amended to enable the shareholders of each Native Corporation to structure the further implementation of the settlement in light of their particular circumstances and needs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) among other things, the shareholders of each Native Corporation must be permitted to decide&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) whether Natives born after December 18, 1971, should participate in the settlement;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) by granting the shareholders of each Native Corporation options to structure the further implementation of the settlement, Congress is not expressing an opinion on the manner in which such shareholders choose to balance individual rights and communal rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) no provision of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note above] shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) unless specifically provided, constitute a repeal or modification, implied or otherwise, of any provision of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) confer on, or deny to, any Native organization any degree of sovereign governmental authority over lands (including management, or regulation of the taking, of fish and wildlife) or persons in Alaska; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and this Act are Indian legislation enacted by Congress pursuant to its plenary authority under the Constitution of the United States to regulate Indian affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Complaint, time for filing; jurisdiction; commencement by State official; certainty and finality of vested rights, titles, and interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action to contest the authority of the United States to legislate on the subject matter or the legality of this chapter shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within one year of December 18, 1971, and no such action shall be entertained unless it is commenced by a duly authorized official of the State. Exclusive jurisdiction over such action is hereby vested in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. The purpose of this limitation on suits is to insure that, after the expiration of a reasonable period of time, the right, title, and interest of the United States, the Natives, and the State of Alaska will vest with certainty and finality and may be relied upon by all other persons in their relations with the State, the Natives, and the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Land selection; suspension and extension of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that the State initiates litigation or voluntarily becomes a party to litigation to contest the authority of the United States to legislate on the subject matter or the legality of this chapter, all rights of land selection granted to the State by the Alaska Statehood Act shall be suspended as to any public lands which are determined by the Secretary to be potentially valuable for mineral development, timber, or other commercial purposes, and no selections shall be made, no tentative approvals shall be granted, and no patents shall be issued for such lands during the pendency of such litigation. In the event of such suspension, the State's right of land selection pursuant to section 6 of the Alaska Statehood Act shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time the selection right was suspended.</p>

The selection shall be made from lands withdrawn by section 1610(a) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That no Village Corporation may select more than 69,120 acres from lands withdrawn by section 1610(a)(2) of this title, and not more than 69,120 acres from the National Wildlife Refuge System, and not more than 69,120 acres in a National Forest: <em>Provided further</em>, That when a Village Corporation selects the surface estate to lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System or Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 4, the Regional Corporation, for that region may select the subsurface estate in an equal acreage from other lands withdrawn in section 1610(a) of this title within the region, if possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Selections made under this subsection (a) of this section shall be contiguous and in reasonably compact tracts, except as separated by bodies of water or by lands which are unavailable for selection, and shall be in whole sections and, wherever feasible, in units of not less than 1,280 acres: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary in his discretion and upon the request of the concerned Village Corporation, may waive the whole section requirement where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) a portion of available public lands of a section is separated from other available public lands in the same section by lands unavailable for selection or by a meanderable body of water;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such waiver will not result in small isolated parcels of available public land remaining after conveyance of selected lands to Native Corporations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) such waiver would result in a better land ownership pattern or improved land or resource management opportunity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the remaining available public lands in the section have been selected and will be conveyed to another Native Corporation under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation; reallocation considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The difference between twenty-two million acres and the total acreage selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be allocated by the Secretary among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) on the basis of the number of Natives enrolled in each region. Each Regional Corporation shall, not later than October 1, 2005, reallocate such acreage among the Native villages within the region on an equitable basis after considering historic use, subsistence needs, and population. The action of the Secretary or the Corporation shall not be subject to judicial review. Each Village Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands withdrawn by section 1610(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The difference between thirty-eight million acres and the 22 million acres selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be allocated among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The number of acres each Regional Corporation is entitled to receive shall be computed (A) by determining on the basis of available data the percentages of all land in Alaska (excluding the southeastern region) that is within each of the eleven regions, (B) by applying that percentage to thirty-eight million acres reduced by the acreage in the southeastern region that is to be selected pursuant to section 1615 of this title, and (C) by deducting from the figure so computed the number of acres within that region selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event that the total number of acres selected within a region pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of the section exceeds the percentage of the reduced thirty-eight million acres allotted to that region pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section, that region shall not be entitled to receive any lands under this subsection (c). For each region so affected the difference between the acreage calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section and the acreage selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be deducted from the acreage calculated under subsection (c)(1)(C) of <!-- PDFPage:401 -->this section for the remaining regions which will select lands under this subsection (c). The reductions shall be apportioned among the remaining regions so that each region's share of the total reduction bears the same proportion to the total reduction as the total land area in that region (as calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1611_1_target" name="1611_1">1</a></sup> bears to the total land area in all of the regions whose allotments are to be reduced pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Before the end of the fourth year after December 18, 1971, each Regional Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(1) of this title, and from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(3) of this title to the extent lands withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(1) of this title are not sufficient to satisfy its allocation: <em>Provided</em>, That within the lands withdrawn by section 1610(a)(1) of this title the Regional Corporation may select only even numbered townships in even numbered ranges, and only odd numbered townships in odd numbered ranges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Where the public lands consist only of the mineral estate, or portion thereof, which is reserved by the United States upon patent of the balance of the estate under one of the public land laws, other than this chapter, the Regional Corporations may select as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Where such public lands were not withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(3) of this title, but are surrounded by or contiguous to lands withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(3) of this title, and filed upon for selection by a Regional Corporation, the Corporation may, upon request, have such public land included in its selection and considered by the Secretary to be withdrawn and properly selected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Where such public lands were withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(1) of this title and are required to be selected by paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Regional Corporation may, at its option, exclude such public lands from its selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Where such public lands are surrounded by or contiguous to subsurface lands obtained by a Regional Corporation under subsections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1611_2_target" name="1611_2">2</a></sup> (a) or (b) of this section, the Corporation may, upon request, have such public land conveyed to it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) A Regional Corporation which elects to obtain public lands under subparagraph (C) shall be limited to a total of not more than 12,000 acres. Selection by a Regional Corporation of in lieu surface acres under subparagraph (E) pursuant to an election under subparagraph (C) shall not be made from any lands within a conservation system unit (as that term is defined by section 3102(4) of title 16).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) An election to obtain the public lands described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) shall include all available parcels within the township in which the public lands are located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (C), the term &ldquo;Regional Corporation&rdquo; shall refer only to Doyon, Limited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Where the Regional Corporation elects to obtain such public lands under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph, it may select, within ninety days of receipt of notice from the Secretary, the surface estate in an equal acreage from other public lands withdrawn by the Secretary for that purpose. Such selections shall be in units no smaller than a whole section, except where the remaining entitlement is less than six hundred and forty acres, or where an entire section is not available. Where possible, selections shall be of lands from which the subsurface estate was selected by that Regional Corporation pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section or section 1613(h)(9) of this title, and, where possible, all selections made under this section shall be contiguous to lands already selected by the Regional Corporation or a Village Corporation. The Secretary is authorized, as necessary, to withdraw up to two times the acreage entitlement of the in lieu surface estate from vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved public lands from which the Regional Corporation may select such in lieu surface estate except that the Secretary may withdraw public lands which had been previously withdrawn pursuant to subsection 1616(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) No mineral estate or in lieu surface estate shall be available for selection within the National Petroleum Reserve&mdash;Alaska or within Wildlife Refuges as the boundaries of those refuges exist on December 18, 1971.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (4) shall apply, notwithstanding the failure of the Regional Corporation to have appealed the rejection of a selection during the conveyance of the relevant surface estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Village Corporation for Native village at Dutch Harbor; lands and improvements and patent for Village Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To insure that the Village Corporation for the Native village at Dutch Harbor, if found eligible for land grants under this chapter, has a full opportunity to select lands within and near the village, no federally owned lands, whether improved or not, shall be disposed of pursuant to the Federal surplus property disposal laws for a period of two years from December 18, 1971. The Village Corporation may select such lands and improvements and receive patent to them pursuant to section 1613(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disputes over land selection rights and boundaries; arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any dispute over the land selection rights and the boundaries of Village Corporations shall be resolved by a board of arbitrators consisting of one person selected by each of the Village Corporations involved, and an additional one or two persons, whichever is needed to make an odd number of arbitrators, such additional person or persons to be selected by the arbitrators selected by the Village Corporations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Combining entitlements and reallocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The entitlements received by any Village Corporation under subsection (a) of this section and the reallocations made to the Village Corporation under subsection (b) of this section may be combined, at the discretion of the Secretary, without&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:402 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) increasing or decreasing the combined entitlement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increasing the limitation on selections of Wildlife Refuge System land, National Forest System land, or State-selected land under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The combined entitlement under paragraph (1) may be fulfilled from selections under subsection (a) or (b) of this section without regard to the entitlement specified in the selection application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) All selections under a combined entitlement under paragraph (1) shall be adjudicated and conveyed in compliance with this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except in a case in which a survey has been contracted for December 10, 2004, the combination of entitlements under paragraph (1) shall not require separate patents or surveys, to distinguish between conveyances made to a Village Corporation under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;contingency area&rdquo; means any area specified in a timber sale contract as an area from which the timber contractor may harvest timber if the volume of timber specified in the contract cannot be obtained from one or more areas definitely designated for timbering in the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Every six months, for a period of two years from December 18, 1971, the Secretary shall advise the Congress of the location, size and values of lands withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (A) and submit his recommendations with respect to such lands.

In the event Congress enacts legislation setting aside any areas withdrawn under the provisions of this subsection which the Regional Corporations or the State desired to select, then other unreserved public lands shall be made available for alternative selection by the Regional Corporations and the State. Any time periods established by law for Regional Corporations or State selections are hereby extended to the extent that delays are caused by compliance with the provisions of this subsection (2).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Revocation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No Native covered by the provisions of this chapter, and no descendant of his, may hereafter avail himself of an allotment under the provisions of the Act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. 389), as amended and supplemented, or the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 363). Further, the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197), as amended, is repealed. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, any application for an allotment that is pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, may, at the option of the Native applicant, be approved and a patent issued in accordance with said 1887, 1910, or 1906 Act, as the case may be, in which event the Native shall not be eligible for a patent under section 1613(h)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charging allotment against statutory grant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any allotments approved pursuant to this section during the four years following December 18, 1971, shall be charged against the two million acre grant provided for in section 1613(h) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Relocation of allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an allotment applicant, who had a valid application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, and whose application remains pending as of October 14, 1992, may amend the land description in the application of the applicant (with the advice and approval of the responsible officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) to describe land other than the land that the applicant originally intended to claim if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the application pending before the Department, either describes land selected by, tentatively approved to, or patented to the State of Alaska or otherwise conflicts with an interest in land granted to the State of Alaska by the United States prior to the filing of the allotment application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amended land description describes land selected by, tentatively approved to, or patented to the State of Alaska of approximately equal acreage in substitution for the land described in the original application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources for the State of Alaska, acting under the authority of State law, has agreed to reconvey or relinquish to the United States the land, or interest in land, described in the amended application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:419 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) If an application pending before the Department of the Interior as described in subparagraph (A) describes land selected by, but not tentatively approved to or patented to, the State of Alaska, the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior shall be required in order for an application to proceed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall accept reconveyance or relinquishment from the State of Alaska of the land described in an amended application pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), except where the land described in the amended application is State-owned land within the boundaries of a conservation system unit as defined in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Upon acceptance, the Secretary shall issue a Native Allotment certificate to the applicant for the land reconveyed or relinquished by the State of Alaska to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall adjust the computation of the acreage charged against the land entitlement of the State of Alaska to ensure that this subsection will not cause the State to receive either more or less than its full land entitlement under section 6 of the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Alaska into the Union&rdquo;, approved July 7, 1958 (commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Alaska Statehood Act&rdquo;), and section 906 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (43 U.S.C. 1635). If the State retains any part of the fee estate, the State shall remain charged with the acreage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Correction of conveyance documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an allotment application is valid or would have been approved under section 1634 of this title had the land described in the application been in Federal ownership on December 2, 1980, the Secretary may correct a conveyance to a Native Corporation or to the State that includes land described in the allotment application to exclude the described allotment land with the written concurrence of the Native Corporation or the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A written concurrence shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include a finding that the land description proposed by the Secretary is acceptable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) attest that the Native Corporation or the State has not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) granted any third party rights or taken any other action that would affect the ability of the United States to convey full title under the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197, chapter 2469); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) stored or allowed the deposit of hazardous waste on the land.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On receipt of an acceptable written concurrence, the Secretary, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) issue a corrected conveyance document to the State or Native Corporation, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) issue a certificate of allotment to the allotment applicant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No documents of reconveyance from the State or an Alaska Native Corporation or evidence of title, other than the written concurrence and attestation described in paragraph (2), are necessary to use the procedures authorized by this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Native allotment revisions on land selected by or conveyed to a Native Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An allotment applicant who had an application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, and whose application is still open on the records of the Department of the Interior as of December 10, 2004, may revise the land description in the application to describe land other than the land that the applicant originally intended to claim if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) describes land selected by or conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Native Corporation formed to receive benefits under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) otherwise conflicts with an interest in land granted to a Native Corporation by the United States;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the revised land description describes land selected by or conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Native Corporation of approximately equal acreage in substitution for the land described in the original application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Director of the Bureau of Land Management has not adopted a final plan of survey for the final entitlement of the Native Corporation or its successor in interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Native Corporation that selected the land or its successor in interest provides a corporate resolution authorizing reconveyance or relinquishment to the United States of the land, or interest in land, described in the revised application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The land description in an allotment application may not be revised under this section unless the Secretary has determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the allotment application is valid or would have been approved under section 1634 of this title had the land in the allotment application been in Federal ownership on December 2, 1980;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in consultation with the administering agency, that the proposed revision would not create an isolated inholding within a conservation system unit (as defined in section 3102 of title 16); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that the proposed revision will facilitate completion of a land transfer in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) On obtaining title evidence acceptable under Department of Justice title standards and acceptance of a reconveyance or relinquishment from a Native Corporation under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall issue a Native allotment certificate to the applicant for the land reconveyed or relinquished by the Native Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any allotment revised under this section shall, when allotted, be made subject to any easement, trail, right-of-way, or any third-party interest (other than a fee interest) in existence on the revised allotment land on the date of revision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reinstatements and reconstructions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an applicant for a Native allotment filed under the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197, chapter 2469) petitions the Secretary to reinstate a previously closed Native allotment application or to accept a reconstructed copy of an application claimed to have been timely filed with an <!-- PDFPage:420 -->agency of the Department of the Interior, the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may seek voluntary reconveyance of any land described in the application that is reinstated or reconstructed after December 10, 2004; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall not file an action in any court to recover title from a current landowner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A certificate of allotment that is issued for any allotment application for which a request for reinstatement or reconstruction is received or accepted after December 10, 2004 shall be made subject to any Federal appropriation, trail, right-of-way, easement, or existing third party interest of record, including third party interests created by the State, without regard to the date on which the Native allotment applicant initiated use and occupancy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The requirements of the laws of the State relating to the solicitation of proxies shall govern solicitation of signatures for a petition described in subparagraph (A) except that the requirements of Federal law shall govern the solicitation of signatures for a petition that is to be submitted to a Native Corporation which at the time of such submission has issued a class of equity securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.]. If a petition meets the applicable solicitation requirements and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the board agrees with such petition, the board shall submit the amendment and either the proponents&rsquo; statement or its own statement in support of the amendment to the shareholders for a vote, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:438 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the board disagrees with the petition for any reason, the board shall submit the amendment and the proponents&rsquo; statement to the shareholders for a vote and may, at its discretion, submit an opposing statement or an alternative amendment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a Native Corporation that on or before the date one year after February 3, 1988, elects application of section 1629c(d) of this title in lieu of section 1629c(b) of this title. Until December 18, 1991, paragraph (1) shall not apply to a Native Corporation that elects application of section 1629c(c) of this title in lieu of section 1629c(b) of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a level of the total voting power of the corporation greater than a majority (but not greater than two-thirds of the total voting power of the corporation) if the corporation establishes such a level by an amendment to its articles of incorporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A Native Corporation in amending its articles of incorporation pursuant to section 1606(g)(2) of this title to authorize the issuance of a new class or series of stock may provide that a majority (or more than a majority) of the shares of such class or series must vote in favor of an amendment or resolution described in subsection (a) of this section (other than an amendment authorized by section 1629c of this title) in order for such amendment or resolution to be approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A resolution described in subsection (a)(3) or an amendment to articles of incorporation under section 1606(g)(1)(B) of this title shall be considered to be approved by the shareholders of a Native Corporation if it receives the affirmative vote of shares representing&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an amount of shares greater than a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting relating to the resolution or amendment to articles of incorporation (but not greater than two-thirds of the total voting power of the corporation) if the corporation establishes such a level by an amendment to its articles of incorporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Substantially all of the assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and section 1629e of this title, a Native Corporation shall be considered to be transferring all or substantially all of its assets to a Settlement Trust only if such assets represent two-thirds or more of the fair market value of the Native Corporation's total assets.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Alienability restrictions shall continue until terminated in accordance with the procedures established by this section. No such termination shall take effect until after July 16, 1993: <em>Provided, however</em>, That this prohibition shall not apply to a Native Corporation whose board of directors approves, no later than March 1, 1992, a resolution (certified by the corporate secretary of such corporation) electing to decline the application of such prohibition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Opt-out procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A Native Corporation may amend its articles of incorporation to terminate alienability <!-- PDFPage:439 -->restrictions in accordance with this subsection. Only one amendment to terminate alienability restrictions shall be considered and voted on prior to December 18, 1991. Rejection of the amendment shall not preclude consideration prior to December 18, 1991, of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If an amendment to terminate alienability restrictions is considered, voted on, and rejected prior to December 18, 1991, then subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions after December 18, 1991, shall be considered and voted on&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If no amendment to terminate alienability restrictions is considered and voted on prior to December 18, 1991, then amendments to terminate alienability restrictions after December 18, 1991, shall be considered and voted on&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recapitalization procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) On or prior to December 18, 1991, a Native Corporation may amend its articles of incorporation to implement a recapitalization plan in accordance with this subsection. Rejection of an amendment or amendments to implement a recapitalization plan shall not preclude consideration prior to December 18, 1991, of a subsequent amendment or amendments to implement such a plan.

No recapitalization plan shall provide for the termination of alienability restrictions prior to December 18, 1991.</p>

Such amendments shall not be effective to extend the restrictions unless approved prior to the expiration of the period of maintenance or extension then in force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The board of directors may ask the shareholders to approve en bloc pursuant to a single vote a series of amendments (including an amendment to authorize the issuance of stock pursuant to section 1606(g) of this title) to implement a recapitalization plan that includes a provision maintaining alienability restrictions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If an amendment to the articles of incorporation of a Native Corporation maintaining or extending alienability restrictions for a specified period of time is approved pursuant to paragraph (1), the restrictions shall automatically terminate at the end of such period unless the restrictions are extended in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1)(C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A Native Corporation that approves an amendment to its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) to maintain or extend alienability restrictions for an indefinite period may later amend its articles to terminate such restrictions. Such amendment shall specify the time of termination, either by establishing a date certain or by describing the specific event upon which the restrictions shall terminate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Rejection of an amendment described in clause (i) by the shareholders shall not preclude consideration of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) This subsection shall not apply to Village Corporations, Urban Corporations, and Group Corporations located outside of the Bristol Bay and Aleut regions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Alienability restrictions imposed on Settlement Common Stock issued by a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection shall terminate on December 18, 1991, unless extended in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The board of directors of a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection shall, at least once prior to January 1, 1991, approve, and submit to a vote of the shareholders, an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation to extend alienability restrictions. If the amendment is not approved by the shareholders, the board of directors may submit another such amendment to the shareholders once or more a year until December 18, 1991.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In lieu of approving the amendment to the articles of incorporation described in clause (i) and submitting such amendment to a vote of the shareholders, at any time prior to January 1, 1991, the board of directors of a Native Corporation that has approved a resolution described in paragraph (1)(A) may approve a new resolution rescinding that prior resolution. Upon approval of the new resolution rescinding a resolution described in paragraph (1)(A), the latter resolution shall be void and alienability restrictions on the Settlement Common Stock of such corporation shall continue subsequent to December 18, 1991, until such time as the alienability restrictions are terminated pursuant to the procedure described in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a civil action that challenges the constitutionality of any provision in clause (ii) shall be barred unless it is filed within one year after the date of the vote of the board of directors approving a resolution to rescind a prior opt-in election under paragraph (1)(A). Any such civil action shall be filed in accordance with section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments of 1987 (101 Stat. 1813&ndash;1814).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B) and any amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (D) may provide for an extension of alienability restrictions for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an indefinite period of time, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a specified period of time of not less than one year and not more than fifty years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If an amendment approved by the shareholders of a Native Corporation pursuant to subparagraph (B) or this subparagraph extends alienability restrictions for a specified period of time, termination of the restrictions at the close of such period may be postponed if a further amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation is approved to extend the restrictions. There shall be no limit on the number of such amendments that can be approved. Such amendments shall not be effective to extend the restrictions unless approved prior to the expiration of the period of extension then in force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If an amendment to the articles of incorporation of a Native Corporation extending alienability restrictions for a specified period of time is approved pursuant to paragraph (2), the restrictions shall automatically terminate at the end of such period unless the restrictions are extended in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2)(D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the board of directors of a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection does not submit for a shareholder vote an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation in accordance with paragraph (2)(B), or if the amendment submitted does not comply with paragraph (2)(C), alienability restrictions shall not terminate and shall instead remain in effect until such time as a court of competent jurisdiction, upon petition of one or more shareholders of the corporation, orders that a shareholder vote be taken on an amendment which complies with paragraph (2)(C) and such vote is conducted. Following the vote, the status of alienability restrictions shall be determined in accordance with the other provisions of this subsection and the amendment, if approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A Native Corporation that approves an amendment to its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (2) to extend alienability restrictions for an indefinite period of time may later amend its articles of incorporation to terminate the restrictions. Such amendment shall specify the time of termination, either by establishing a date certain or by describing the specific event upon which the restrictions shall terminate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The rejection of an amendment described in subparagraph (A) by the shareholders shall not preclude consideration of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) If a Native Corporation amends its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (2) to extend alienability restrictions, a shareholder who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) voted against such amendment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) desires to relinquish his or her Settlement Common Stock in exchange for the stock or payment authorized by the board of directors pursuant to subparagraph (B),</p>
