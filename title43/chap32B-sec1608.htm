In the event the United States or the State elects to take royalties in kind, there shall be paid into the Fund on account thereof an amount equal to the royalties that would have been paid into the Fund under the provisions of this section had the royalty been taken in cash.</p>

Thereafter, payments which would otherwise go into the Alaska Native Fund will be made to the United States Treasury as reimbursement for the advance payments authorized by section 407 of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Final payment; order of computation</h4>
