After receipt of such recommendations and before their submission to the President, the Secretary of the Interior shall provide an opportunity for comments in accordance with paragraph (2). The Secretary of the Interior shall forward such comments to the President with the recommendations&mdash;</p>

The Commission may prepare and submit to the President a report on the impact of implementation of such application upon competition and restraint of trade and on whether such implementation would be inconsistent with the antitrust laws.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this chapter shall bar the Attorney General or any other appropriate officer or agent of the United States from challenging any anticompetitive act or practice related to the ownership, construction, or operation of any crude oil transportation system approved under this chapter. The approval of any such system under this chapter shall not be deemed to convey to any person immunity from civil or criminal liability or to create defenses to actions under the antitrust laws and shall not modify or abridge any private right of action under such laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Filing and review of permits, rights-of-way applications, etc., not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the acceptance and review by any Federal agency of any application for any Federal permit, right-of-way, or other authorizations under other provisions of law for a crude oil transportation system eligible for consideration under this chapter; except that any determination with respect to such an application may be made only in accordance with the provisions of section 2009(a) of this title.</p>
