In the event that such dividend right is not expressly altered or eliminated by the terms of the merger or consolidation, such class of stockholders shall continue to receive such dividends pursuant to section 1606(j) or (m) of this title as would have been applicable if the merger or consolidation had not taken place and all Village Corporations within the affected region continued to exist separately.</p>
