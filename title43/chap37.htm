<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1901. Congressional findings and declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) vast segments of the public rangelands are producing less than their potential for livestock, wildlife habitat, recreation, forage, and water and soil conservation benefits, and for that reason are in an unsatisfactory condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such rangelands will remain in an unsatisfactory condition and some areas may decline further under present levels of, and funding for, management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) unsatisfactory conditions on public rangelands present a high risk of soil loss, desertification,<sup><a href="#1901_1_target" name="1901_1">1</a></sup> and a resultant underproductivity for large acreages of the public lands; contribute significantly to unacceptable levels of siltation and salinity in major western watersheds including the Colorado River; negatively impact the quality and availability of scarce western water supplies; threaten important and frequently critical fish and wildlife habitat; prevent expansion of the forage resource and resulting benefits to livestock and wildlife production; increase surface runoff and flood danger; reduce the value of such lands for recreational and esthetic purposes; and may ultimately lead to unpredictable and undesirable long-term local and regional climatic and economic changes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the above-mentioned conditions can be addressed and corrected by an intensive public rangelands maintenance, management, and improvement program involving significant increases in levels of rangeland management and improvement funding for multiple-use values;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to prevent economic disruption and harm to the western livestock industry, it is in the public interest to charge a fee for livestock grazing permits and leases on the public lands which is based on a formula reflecting annual changes in the costs of production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Act of December 15, 1971 (85 Stat. 649, 16 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), continues to be successful in its goal of protecting wild free-roaming horses and burros from capture, branding, harassment, and death, but that certain amendments are necessary thereto to avoid excessive costs in the administration of the Act, and to facilitate the humane adoption or disposal of excess wild free-roaming horses and burros which because they exceed the carrying capacity of the range, pose a threat to their own habitat, fish, wildlife, recreation, water and soil conservation, domestic livestock grazing, and other rangeland values;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress therefore hereby establishes and reaffirms a national policy and commitment to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inventory and identify current public rangelands conditions and trends as a part of the inventory process required by section 1711(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) manage, maintain and improve the condition of the public rangelands so that they become as productive as feasible for all rangeland values in accordance with management objectives and the land use planning process established pursuant to section 1712 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) charge a fee for public grazing use which is equitable and reflects the concerns addressed in paragraph (a)(5) above;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) continue the policy of protecting wild free-roaming horses and burros from capture, branding, harassment, or death, while at the same time facilitating the removal and disposal of excess wild free-roaming horses and burros which pose a threat to themselves and their habitat and to other rangeland values;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The policies of this chapter shall become effective only as specific statutory authority for their implementation is enacted by this chapter or by subsequent legislation, and shall be construed as supplemental to and not in derogation of the purposes for which public rangelands are administered under other provisions of law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No less than 80 per centum of such funds provided herein shall be used for on-the-ground range rehabilitation, maintenance and the construction of range improvements (including project layout, project design, and project supervision). No more than 15 per centum of such funds provided herein shall be used to hire and train such experienced and qualified personnel as are necessary to implement on-the-ground supervision and enforcement of the land use plans required pursuant to section 1712 of this title and such allotment management plans as may be developed. Such funds shall be distributed as the Secretary deems advisable after careful and considered consultation and coordination, including public hearings and meetings where appropriate, with the district grazing advisory boards established pursuant to section 1753 of this title, and the advisory councils established pursuant to section 1739 of this title, range user representatives, and other interested parties. To the maximum extent practicable, and where economically sound, the Secretary shall give priority to entering into cooperative agreements with range users (or user groups) for the installation and maintenance of on-the-ground range improvements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Environmental assessment record and environmental impact statement requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the use of any funds authorized by this section the Secretary shall cause to have prepared an environmental assessment record on each range improvement project. Thereafter, improvement projects may be constructed unless the Secretary determines that the project will have a significant impact on the quality of human environment, necessitating an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] prior to the expenditure of funds.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Scope of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture are hereby authorized and directed to develop and implement, on an experimental basis on selected areas of the public rangelands which are representative of the broad spectrum of range conditions, trends, and forage values, a program which provides incentives to, or rewards for, the holders of grazing permits and leases whose stewardship results in an improvement of the range condition of lands under permit or lease. Such program shall explore innovative grazing management policies and systems which might provide incentives to improve range conditions. These may include, but need not be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cooperative range management projects designed to foster a greater degree of cooperation and coordination between the Federal and State agencies charged with the management of the rangelands and with local private range users,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the payment of up to 50 per centum of the amount due the Federal Government from grazing permittees in the form of range improvement work,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such other incentives as he may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No later than December 31, 1985, the Secretaries shall report to the Congress the results of such experimental program, their evaluation of the fee established in section 1905 of this title and other grazing fee options, and their recommendations to implement a grazing fee schedule for the 1986 and subsequent grazing years.</p>
