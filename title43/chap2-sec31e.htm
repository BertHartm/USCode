<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, acting through the Director, shall, with the advice and review of the advisory committee, prepare an implementation plan for the geologic mapping program. The plan shall identify the overall management structure and operation of the geologic mapping program and shall provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the role of the Survey in its capacity as overall management lead, including the responsibility for developing the national geologic mapping program that meets Federal needs while simultaneously fostering State needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the responsibilities accruing to the State geological surveys, with particular emphasis on mechanisms that incorporate their needs, missions, capabilities, and requirements into the nationwide geologic mapping program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) mechanisms for identifying short- and long-term priorities for each component of the geologic mapping program, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the Federal geologic mapping component, a priority-setting mechanism that responds both to (i) Federal mission requirements for geologic-map information, and (ii) critical scientific problems that require geologic-map control for their resolution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the geologic mapping support component, a strong interdisciplinary research program plan in isotopic and paleontologic geochronology, geophysical mapping, and process studies to provide data to and interpret results from geologic mapping;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for the State geologic mapping component, a priority-setting mechanism that responds to (i) specific intrastate needs for geologic-map information, and (ii) interstate needs shared by adjacent entities that have common requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) for the geologic mapping education component, a priority-setting mechanism that responds to requirements for geologic-map information that are driven by Federal and State mission requirements;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of the degree to which the Survey can acquire, archive, and use Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) or Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) data in a manner that is technically appropriate for geologic or related mapping studies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a mechanism for adopting scientific and technical map standards for preparing and publishing general-purpose and special-purpose geologic maps to (A) assure uniformity of cartographic and scientific conventions, and (B) provide a basis for judgment as to the comparability and quality of map products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a mechanism for monitoring the inventory of published and current mapping investigations nationwide in order to facilitate planning and information exchange and to avoid redundancy.</p>
