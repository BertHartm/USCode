<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, acting through the Director, shall, with the advice and review of the advisory committee, prepare a 5-year plan for the geologic mapping program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The 5-year plan shall identify&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) overall priorities for the geologic mapping program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) implementation of the overall management structure and operation of the geologic mapping program, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the role of the Survey in the capacity of overall management lead, including the responsibility for developing the national geologic mapping program that meets Federal needs while fostering State needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the responsibilities of the State geological surveys, with emphasis on mechanisms that incorporate the needs, missions, capabilities, and requirements of the State geological surveys, into the nationwide geologic mapping program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) mechanisms for identifying short- and long-term priorities for each component of the geologic mapping program, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for the Federal component, a priority-setting mechanism that responds to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Federal mission requirements for geologic map information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) critical scientific problems that require geologic maps for their resolution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) shared Federal and State needs for geologic maps, in which joint Federal-State geologic mapping projects are in the national interest;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for the State component, a priority-setting mechanism that responds to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:13 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) specific intrastate needs for geologic map information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) interstate needs shared by adjacent States that have common requirements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for the education component, a priority-setting mechanism that responds to requirements for geologic map information that are dictated by Federal and State mission requirements;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a mechanism for adopting scientific and technical mapping standards for preparing and publishing general- and special-purpose geologic maps to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) ensure uniformity of cartographic and scientific conventions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide a basis for assessing the comparability and quality of map products; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a mechanism for monitoring the inventory of published and current mapping investigations nationwide to facilitate planning and information exchange and to avoid redundancy.</p>
