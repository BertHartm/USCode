<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3002. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Nation needs an adequate water supply for all states [States] at a reasonable cost;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the demands on the Nation's finite water supply are increasing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) coordination on both the Federal level and the local level is needed to achieve water policy objectives;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) not less than fourteen agencies of the Federal Government are currently charged with functions relating to the oversight of water policy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the diverse authority over Federal water policy has resulted in unclear goals and an inefficient handling of the Nation's water policy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the conflict between competing goals and objectives by Federal, State, and local agencies as well as by private water users is particularly acute in the nineteen Western States which have arid climates which include the seventeen reclamation States, Hawaii, and Alaska;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the appropriations doctrine of water allocation which characterizes most western water management regimes varies from State to State, and results in many instances in increased competition for limited resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the Federal Government has recognized and continues to recognize the primary jurisdiction of the several States over the allocation, priority, and use of water resources of the States, except to the extent such jurisdiction has been preempted in whole or in part by the Federal Government, including, but not limited to, express or implied Federal reserved water rights either for itself or for the benefit of Indian Tribes, and that the Federal Government will, in exercising its authorities, comply with applicable State laws;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the Federal Government recognizes its trust responsibilities to protect Indian water rights and assist Tribes in the wise use of those resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Reclamation, have had, and will continue to have major <!-- PDFPage:73 -->responsibilities in assisting States in the wise management and allocation of scarce water resources; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the Secretary of the Interior, given his responsibilities for management of public land, trust responsibilities for Indians, administration of the reclamation program, investigations and reviews into ground water resources through the Geologic Survey [now United States Geological Survey], and the Secretary of the Army, given his responsibilities for flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement, have the resources to assist in a comprehensive review, in consultation with appropriate officials from the nineteen Western States, into the problems and potential solutions facing the nineteen Western States and the Federal Government in the increasing competition for the scarce water resources of the Western States.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3003. PRESIDENTIAL REVIEW.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The President is directed to undertake a comprehensive review of Federal activities in the nineteen Western States which directly or indirectly affect the allocation and use of water resources, whether surface or subsurface, and to submit a report on the President's findings, together with recommendations, if any, to the Committees on Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works and Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees on Natural Resources, Public Works and Transportation [now Transportation and Infrastructure], Merchant Marine and Fisheries and Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Such report shall be submitted within three years from the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 30, 1992].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) In conducting the review and preparing the report, the President is directed to consult with the Advisory Commission established under section 3004 of this title, and may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army or other Federal officials or the Commission to undertake such studies or other analyses as the President determines would assist in the review.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) The President shall consult periodically with the Commission, and upon the request of the President, the heads of other Federal agencies are directed to cooperate with and assist the Commission in its activities.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) at least one representative chosen from a list submitted by Tribal governments located in the Western States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In addition to the ten members appointed by the President, twelve Members from the United States Congress shall serve as ex officio members of the Commission. For the United States Senate: the Chairmen and the Ranking Minority Members of the Committees on Energy and Natural Resources, and Appropriations, and the Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources which has jurisdiction over the Bureau of Reclamation.

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) The President shall appoint one member of the Commission to serve as Chairman.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) Any vacancy which may occur on the Commission shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) Members of the Commission shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for travel, subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Commission shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Storage in reservoir projects; agreements for payment of cost of construction or modification of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the policy set forth in this section, it is provided that storage may be included in any reservoir project surveyed, planned, constructed or to be planned, surveyed and/or constructed by the Corps of Engineers or the Bureau of Reclamation to impound water for present or anticipated future demand or need for municipal or industrial water, and the reasonable value thereof may be taken into account in estimating the economic value of the entire project: <em>Provided</em>, That the cost of any construction or modification authorized under the provisions of this section shall be determined on the basis that all authorized purposes served by the project shall share equitably in the benefits of multiple purpose construction, as determined by the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Interior, as the case may be: <em>Provided further</em>, That before construction or modification of any project including water supply provisions for present demand is initiated, State or local interests shall agree to pay for the cost of such provisions in accordance with the provisions of this section: <em>And provided further</em>, That (1) for Corps of Engineers projects, not to exceed 30 percent of the total estimated cost of any project may be allocated to anticipated future demands, and, (2) for Bureau of Reclamation projects, not to exceed 30 per centum of the total estimated cost of any project may be allocated to anticipated future demands where State or local interests give reasonable assurances, and there is reasonable evidence, that such demands for the use of such storage will be made within a period of time which will permit paying out the costs allocated to water supply within the life of the project: <em>And provided further</em>, That for Corps of Engineers projects, the Secretary of the Army may permit the full non-Federal contribution to be made, without interest, during construction of the project, or, with interest, over a period of not more than thirty years from the date of completion, with repayment contracts providing for recalculation of the interest rate at, five-year intervals, and for Bureau of Reclamation projects, the entire amount of the construction costs, including interest during construction, allocated to water supply shall be repaid within the life of the project but in no event to exceed fifty years after the project is first used for the storage of water for water supply purposes, except that (1) <!-- PDFPage:85 -->no payment need be made with respect to storage for future water supply until such supply is first used, and (2) no interest shall be charged on such cost until such supply is first used, but in no case shall the interest-free period exceed ten years. For Corps of Engineers projects, all annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for municipal and industrial water supply storage under the provisions of this section shall be reimbursed from State or local interests on an annual basis. For Corps of Engineers projects, any repayment by a State or local interest shall be made with interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period, during the month preceding the fiscal year in which costs for the construction of the project are first incurred (or, when a recalculation is made), plus a premium of one-eighth of one percentage point for transaction costs. For Bureau of Reclamation projects, the interest rate used for purposes of computing interest during construction and interest on the unpaid balance shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which construction is initiated, on the basis of the computed average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations, which are neither due nor callable for redemption for fifteen years from date of issue. The provisions of this subsection insofar as they relate to the Bureau of Reclamation and the Secretary of the Interior shall be alternative to and not a substitute for the provisions of the Reclamation Projects Act of 1939 (53 Stat. 1187) [43 U.S.C. 485 et seq.] relating to the same subject.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment of existing recordable contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Recordable contracts existing on October 12, 1982, shall be amended at the request of the landowner to conform with the ownership limitations contained in this subchapter: <em>Provided</em>, That the time period for disposal of excess lands specified in the existing recordable contract shall not be extended except as provided in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Power of attorney requirement in contracts; exercise of power by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any recordable contract covering excess lands sales shall provide that a power of attorney shall vest in the Secretary to sell any excess lands not disposed of by the owners thereof within the period of time specified in the recordable contract. In the exercise of that power, the Secretary shall sell such lands through an impartial selection process only to qualified purchasers according to such reasonable rules and regulations as the Secretary may establish: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall recover for the owner the fair market value of the land unrelated to irrigation water deliveries plus the fair market value of improvements thereon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Extension of time for disposal of excess lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event that the owner of any lands in excess of the ownership limitations of Federal reclamation law has heretofore entered into a recordable contract with the Secretary for the disposition of such excess lands and has been prevented from disposing of them because the Secretary may have withheld the processing or approval of the disposition of the lands (whether he may have been compelled to do so by court order or for other reasons), the period of time for the disposal of such lands by the owner thereof pursuant to the contract shall be extended from the date on which the Secretary again commences the processing or the approval of the disposition of such lands for a period which shall be equal to the remaining period of time under the recordable contract for the disposal thereof by the owner at the time the decision of the Secretary to withhold the processing or approval of such disposition first became effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Eligibility of excess lands for irrigation water after disposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Excess lands which have been or may be disposed of in compliance with Federal reclamation law, including this subchapter, shall not be considered eligible to receive irrigation water unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) they are held by nonexcess owners; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of disposals made after October 12, 1982, their title is burdened by a covenant prohibiting their sale, for a period of ten years after their original disposal to comply with Federal reclamation law, including this subchapter, for values exceeding the sum of the value of newly added improvements and the value of the land as increased by market appreciation unrelated to the delivery of irrigation water. Upon expiration of the terms of such covenant, the title to such lands shall be freed of the burden of any limitations on subsequent sale values which might otherwise be imposed by the operation of section 423e of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Plans and estimates; review by States; allocation of capital costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any proposal with respect to the construction of a project which has not theretofore been authorized for construction under the Federal reclamation laws shall set forth, among other things, a plan and estimated cost in detail comparable to those included in preauthorization reports required for a Federal reclamation project; shall have been submitted for review by the States of the drainage basin in which the project is located in like manner as provided in section 701&ndash;1(c) of title 33, except that the review may be limited to the State or States in which the project is located if the proposal is one solely for rehabilitation and betterment of an existing project; and shall include a proposed allocation of capital costs to functions such that costs for facilities used for a single purpose shall be allocated to that purpose and costs for facilities used for more than one purpose shall be so allocated among the purposes served that each purpose will share equitably in the costs of such joint facilities. The costs of means and measures to prevent loss of and damage to fish and wildlife resources shall be considered as project costs and allocated as may be appropriate among project functions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Lands and water rights; ownership; financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Every such proposal shall include a showing that the organization already holds or can acquire all lands and interests in land (except public and other lands and interests in land owned by the United States which are within the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary and subject to disposition by him) and rights, pursuant to applicable State law, to the use of water necessary for the successful construction, operation, and maintenance of the project and that it is ready, able, and willing to finance otherwise than by loan and grant of Federal funds such portion of the cost of the project (which portion shall include all costs of acquiring lands, interests in land, and rights to the use of water), except as provided in section 422e(b)(2) of this title as the Secretary shall have advised is proper in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall require each organization to contribute toward the cost of the project (other than by loan and/or grant of Federal funds) an amount equal to 25 percent or more of the allowable estimated cost of the project: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary, at his discretion, may reduce the amount of such contribution to the extent that he determines that the organization is unable to secure financing from other sources under reasonable terms and conditions, and shall include letters from lenders or other written evidence in support of any funding of an applicant's inability to secure such financing in any project proposal transmitted to the Congress: <em>Provided further</em>, That under no circumstances shall the Secretary reduce the amount of such contribution to less than 10 percent of the allowable estimated total project costs. In determining the amount of the contribution as required by this paragraph, the Secretary shall credit toward that amount the cost of investigations, surveys, engineering, and other services necessary to the preparation of proposals and plans for the project as required by the Secretary, and the costs of lands and rights-of-way required for the project, and the $5,000 fee described in section 422c of this title. In determining the allowable estimated cost of the project, the Secretary shall not include the amount of grants accorded to the organization under section 422e(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transmittal of findings and approval to Congress; certification of soil survey; reservation of land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At such time as a project is found by the Secretary and the Governor of the State in which it is located (or an appropriate State agency designated by him) to be financially feasible, is determined by the Secretary to constitute a reasonable risk under the provisions of this subchapter, and is approved by the Secretary, such findings and approval shall be transmitted to the Congress. Each project proposal transmitted by the Secretary to the Congress shall include a certification by the Secretary that an adequate soil survey and land classification has been made, or that the successful irrigability of those lands and their susceptibility to sustained production of agricultural crops by means of irrigation has been demonstrated in practice. Such proposal shall also include an investigation of soil characteristics which might result in toxic or hazardous irrigation return flows. The Secretary, at the time of submitting the project proposal to Congress or at the time of his determination that the requested project constitutes a reasonable risk under the provisions of this subchapter, may reserve from use or disposition inimical to the project any lands and interests in land owned by the United States which are within his administrative jurisdiction and subject to disposition by him and which are required for use by the project. Any such reservation shall expire at the end of two years unless the contract provided for in section 422e of this title shall have been executed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:126 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of loan and/or grant; increase by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the time of his submitting the project proposal to the Congress, or at any subsequent time prior to completion of construction of the project, including projects heretofore approved, the Secretary may increase the amount of the requested loan and/or grant to an amount within the maximum allowed by section 422e(a) of this title, as amended by Pub. L. 94&ndash;181, to compensate for increases in construction costs due to price escalation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Appropriation; nonapplicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No appropriation shall be made for financial participation in any such project prior to sixty calendar days (which sixty days, however, shall not include days on which either the House of Representatives or the Senate is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three calendar days to a day certain) from the date on which the Secretary's findings and approval are submitted to the Congress and then only if, within said sixty days, neither the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives nor the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate disapproves the project proposal by committee resolution. The provisions of this subsection (e) shall not be applicable to proposals made under section 422f of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consideration of financial feasibility, emergency, or urgent need; jurisdiction and control of project works and facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall give due consideration to financial feasibility, emergency, or urgent need for the project. All project works and facilities constructed under this subchapter shall remain under the jurisdiction and control of the local contracting organization subject to the terms of the repayment contract.</p>

Any such deferment shall be effected only after findings by the Secretary that the installments under consideration probably cannot be paid on their due date without undue burden on the water users, considering the various factors which in the Secretary's judgment bear on the ability of the water users so to pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may effect the deferments hereunder subject to such conditions and provisions relating to the operation and maintenance of the project involved as he deems to be in the interest of the United States. If, however, any deferments would affect installments to accrue more than twelve months after the action of deferment, they shall be effected only by a formal supplemental contract. Such a contract shall provide by its terms that, it being only an interim solution of the repayment problems dealt with therein, its terms are not, in themselves, to be construed as a criterion of the terms of any amendatory contract that may be negotiated and that any such amendatory contract must be approved by the Congress unless it does not lengthen the repayment period for the project in question beyond that permitted by <!-- PDFPage:146 -->the laws applicable to that project, involves no reduction in the total amount payable by the water users, and is not in other respects less advantageous to the Government than the existing contract arrangements.

<p class="statutory-body">For any project, division of a project, development unit of a project, or supplemental works on a project, under construction on August 4, 1939, or for which appropriations had been made, and in connection with which a repayment contract had not been executed, allocations of costs may be made in accordance with the provisions of section 485h of this title and a repayment contract may be negotiated, in the discretion of the Secretary, (1) pursuant to the authority of subsection (a) of this section or (2) in accordance, as near as may be, with the provisions in section 485h(d) or 485h(e) of this title. In connection with any such project, division, or development unit, on which the majority of the lands involved are public lands of the United States, the Secretary, prior to entering into a repayment contract, may fix a development period for each irrigation block, if any, of not to exceed ten years from and including the first year in which water is delivered for the lands in said block: <em>Provided</em>, That in the event a development period is fixed prior to execution of a repayment contract, execution thereof shall be a condition precedent to delivery of water after the close of the development period. During any such development period water shall be delivered to the lands in the irrigation block involved only on a toll-charge basis, at a charge per annum per acre-foot to be fixed by the Secretary each year and to be collected in advance of delivery of water. Pending negotiation and execution of a repayment contract for any other such project, division, or development unit, water may be delivered for a period of not more than five years from August 4, 1939, on the same toll-charge basis. Any such toll charges collected and which the Secretary determines to be in excess of the cost of operation and maintenance during the toll-charge period shall be credited to the construction cost of the project in the manner determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report of proposed contracts to Congress; approval; amendment after approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary from time to time shall report to the Congress on any proposed contracts negotiated pursuant to the authority of subsection (a) or (b)(1) of this section, and he may execute any such contract on behalf of the United States only after approval thereof has been given by Act of Congress. Contracts, so approved, however, may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement and without further approval by Congress if such amendments are within the scope of authority granted prior to or after April 24, 1945, to the Secretary under any Act, except that amendments providing for repayment of construction charges in a period of years longer than authorized by this subchapter, as it may be amended, shall be effective only when approved by Congress.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;485g. Classification of lands</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized and directed in the manner hereinafter provided to classify or to reclassify, from time to time but not more often than at five-year intervals, as to irrigability and productivity those lands which have been, are, or may be included within any project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Necessity for request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No classification or reclassification pursuant to the authority of this subchapter shall be undertaken unless a request therefor, by an organization or duly authorized representatives of the water users, in the form required by subsection (c) of this section has been made of the Secretary. The Secretary shall plan the classification work, undertaken pursuant to the authority of this section, in such manner as in his judgment will result in the most expeditious completion of the work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Furnishing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any request made to the Secretary for a land classification or reclassification under this section, the organization or representatives of the water users shall furnish a list of those lands which are considered to be of comparatively low productivity or to be nonproductive, and of those lands which are considered to be of greater or lesser productivity than indicated by existing classifications, if any, made pursuant to the Federal reclamation laws, and shall furnish also such data relating thereto as the Secretary by regulation may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Primary determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon receipt of any such request the Secretary shall make a preliminary determination whether the requested land classification or reclassification probably is justified by reason of the conditions of the lands involved and other pertinent conditions of the project, including its contractual relations with the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Probable justification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary finds probable justification and if the advance to the United States hereinafter required is made, he shall undertake as soon as practicable the classification or reclassification of the lands listed in the request, and of any other lands which have been, are, or may be included within the project involved and which in his judgment should be classified or reclassified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">One-half of the expense involved in any classification work undertaken pursuant to this sec<!-- PDFPage:148 -->tion shall be charged to operation and maintenance administration nonreimbursable; and one-half shall be paid in advance by the organization involved. On determining probable justification for the requested classification or reclassification as provided in this section, the Secretary shall estimate the cost of the work involved and shall submit a statement of the estimated cost to said organization. Said organization, before commencement of the work, shall advance to the United States one-half of the amount set forth in said statement and also shall advance one-half of the amount of supplementary estimates of costs which the Secretary may find it necessary to make from time to time during the progress of the work; and said amounts shall be and remain available for expenditure by the Secretary for the purposes for which they are advanced, until the work is completed or abandoned. After completion or abandonment of the work, the Secretary, shall determine the actual costs thereof; and said organization shall pay any additional amount required to make its total payments hereunder equal to one-half of the actual cost or shall be credited with any amount by which advances made by it exceed one-half of said actual cost, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Classification as prerequisite to contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If in the judgment of the Secretary a classification or reclassification pursuant to the provisions of this section is a necessary preliminary to entering into a contract under section 485b or 485c&nbsp;<sup><a href="#485g_1_target" name="485g_1">1</a></sup> of this title, he may require the same as a condition precedent to entering into such a contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Modification of existing obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No modification of any existing obligation to pay construction charges on any project shall be made by reason of any classification or reclassification undertaken pursuant to this section without express authority therefor granted by Congress upon recommendations of the Secretary made in a report under subsection (f) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No expenditures for the construction of any new project, new division of a project, or new supplemental works on a project shall be made, nor shall estimates be submitted therefor, by the Secretary until after he has made an investigation thereof and has submitted to the President and to the Congress his report and findings on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the engineering feasibility of the proposed construction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the estimated cost of the proposed construction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the part of the estimated cost which can properly be allocated to irrigation and probably be repaid by the water users;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the part of the estimated cost which can properly be allocated to power and probably be returned to the United States in net power revenues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the part of the estimated cost which can properly be allocated to municipal water supply or other miscellaneous purposes and probably be returned to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the proposed construction is found by the Secretary to have engineering feasibility and if the repayable and returnable allocations to irrigation, power, and municipal water supply or other miscellaneous purposes found by the Secretary to be proper, together with any allocation to flood control or navigation made under subsection (b) of this section, equal the total estimated cost of construction as determined by the Secretary, then the new project, new division of a project, or supplemental works on a project, covered by his findings, shall be deemed authorized and may be undertaken by the Secretary. If all such allocations do not equal said total estimated cost, then said new project, new division, or new supplemental works may be undertaken by the Secretary only after provision therefor has been made by Act of Congress enacted after the Secretary has submitted to the President and the Congress the report and findings involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of part of cost to flood control or navigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with any new project, new division of a project, or supplemental works on a project there may be allocated to flood control or navigation the part of said total estimated cost which the Secretary may find to be proper. Items for any such allocations made in connection with projects which may be undertaken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be included in the estimates of appropriations submitted by the Secretary for said projects, and funds for such portions of the projects shall not become available except as directly appropriated or allotted to the Department of the Interior. In connection with the making of such an allocation, the Secretary shall consult with the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army, and may perform any of the necessary investigations or studies under a cooperative agreement with the Secretary of the Army. In the event of such an allocation the Secretary of the Interior shall operate the project for purposes of flood control or navigation, to the extent justified by said allocation therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Furnishing water to municipalities; sale of electric power; lease of power privileges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts to furnish water for municipal water sup<!-- PDFPage:149 -->ply or miscellaneous purposes: <em>Provided</em>, That any such contract either (1) shall require repayment to the United States, over a period of not to exceed forty years from the year in which water is first delivered for the use of the contracting party, with interest not exceeding the rate of 3&frac12; per centum per annum if the Secretary determines an interest charge to be proper, of an appropriate share as determined by the Secretary of that part of the construction costs allocated by him to municipal water supply or other miscellaneous purposes; or (2) shall be for such periods, not to exceed forty years, and at such rates as in the Secretary's judgment will produce revenues at least sufficient to cover an appropriate share of the annual operation and maintenance cost and an appropriate share of such fixed charges as the Secretary deems proper, and shall require the payment of said rates each year in advance of delivery of water for said year. Any sale of electric power or lease of power privileges, made by the Secretary in connection with the operation of any project or division of a project, shall be for such periods, not to exceed forty years, and at such rates as in his judgment will produce power revenues at least sufficient to cover an appropriate share of the annual operation and maintenance cost, interest on an appropriate share of the construction investment at not less than 3 per centum per annum, and such other fixed charges as the Secretary deems proper: <em>Provided further</em>, That in said sales or leases preference shall be given to municipalities and other public corporations or agencies; and also to cooperatives and other nonprofit organizations financed in whole or in part by loans made pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 [7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.]. Nothing in this subsection shall be applicable to provisions in existing contracts, made pursuant to law, for the use of power and miscellaneous revenues of a project for the benefit of users of water from such project. The provisions of this subsection respecting the terms of sales of electric power and leases of power privileges shall be in addition and alternative to any authority in existing laws relating to particular projects. No contract relating to municipal water supply or miscellaneous purposes or to electric power or power privileges shall be made unless, in the judgment of the Secretary, it will not impair the efficiency of the project for irrigation purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Delivery of water for irrigation; repayment contract prerequisites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No water may be delivered for irrigation of lands in connection with any new project, new division of a project, or supplemental works on a project until an organization, satisfactory in form and powers to the Secretary, has entered into a repayment contract with the United States, in a form satisfactory to the Secretary, providing among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That the Secretary may fix a development period for each irrigation block, if any, of not to exceed ten years from and including the first calendar year in which water is delivered for the lands in said block; and that during the development period water shall be delivered to the lands in the irrigation block involved at a charge per annum per acre-foot, or other charge, to be fixed by the Secretary each year and to be paid in advance of delivery of water: <em>Provided</em>, That where the lands included in an irrigation block are for the most part lands owned by the United States, the Secretary, prior to execution of a repayment contract, may fix a development period, but in such case execution of such a contract shall be a condition precedent to delivery of water after the close of the development period: <em>Provided further</em>, That when the Secretary, by contract or by notice given thereunder, shall have fixed a development period of less than ten years, and at any time thereafter but before commencement of the repayment period conditions arise which in the judgment of the Secretary would have justified the fixing of a longer period, he may amend such contract or notice to extend such development period to a date not to exceed ten years from its commencement, and in a case where no development period was provided, he may amend such contract within the same limits: <em>Provided further</em>, That when the Secretary shall have deferred the payment of all or any part of any installments of construction charges under any repayment contract pursuant to the authority of the Act of September 21, 1959 (73 Stat. 584), he may, at any time prior to the due date prescribed for the first installment not reduced by such deferment, and by agreement with the contracting organization, terminate the supplemental contract by which such deferment was effected, credit the construction payments made, and exercise the authority granted in this section. After the close of the development period, any such charges collected and which the Secretary determines to be in excess of the cost of the operation and maintenance during the development period shall be credited to the construction cost of the project in the manner determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That the part of the construction costs allocated by the Secretary to irrigation shall be included in a general repayment obligation of the organization; and that the organization may vary its distribution of construction charges in a manner that takes into account the productivity of the various classes of lands and the benefits accruing to the lands by reason of the construction: <em>Provided</em>, That no distribution of construction charges over the lands included in the organization shall in any manner be deemed to relieve the organization or any party or any land therein of the organization's general obligation to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That the general repayment obligation of the organization shall be spread in annual installments, of the number and amounts fixed by the Secretary, over a period of not more than 40 years, exclusive of any development period fixed under paragraph (1) of this subsection, for any project contract unit or, if the project contract unit be divided into two or more irrigation blocks, for any such block, or as near to said period of not more than forty years as is consistent with the adoption and operation of a variable payment formula <!-- PDFPage:150 -->which, being based on full repayment within such period under average conditions, permits variance in the required annual payments in the light of economic factors pertinent to the ability of the organization to pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) That the first annual installment for any project contract unit, or for any irrigation block, as the case may be, shall accrue, on the date fixed by the Secretary, in the year after the last year of the development period or, if there be not development period, in the calendar year after the Secretary announces that the construction contemplated in the repayment contract is substantially completed or is advanced to a point where delivery of water can be made to substantially all of the lands in said unit or block to be irrigated; and if there be no development period fixed, that prior to and including the year in which the Secretary makes said announcement water shall be delivered only on the toll charge basis hereinbefore provided for development periods.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contracts to furnish water</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In lieu of entering into a repayment contract pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section to cover that part of the cost of the construction of works connected with water supply and allocated to irrigation, the Secretary, in his discretion, may enter into either short- or long-term contracts to furnish water for irrigation purposes. Each such contract shall be for such period, not to exceed forty years, and at such rates as in the Secretary's judgment will produce revenues at least sufficient to cover an appropriate share of the annual operation and maintenance cost and an appropriate share of such fixed charges as the Secretary deems proper, due consideration being given to that part of the cost of construction of works connected with water supply and allocated to irrigation; and shall require payment of said rates each year in advance of delivery of water for said year. In the event such contracts are made for furnishing water for irrigation purposes, the costs of any irrigation water distribution works constructed by the United States in connection with the new project, new division of a project, or supplemental works on a project, shall be covered by a repayment contract entered into pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No less than sixty days before entering into or amending any repayment contract or any contract for the delivery of irrigation water (except any contract for the delivery of surplus or interim irrigation water whose duration is for one year or less) the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) publish notice of the proposed contract or amendment in newspapers of general circulation in the affected area and shall make reasonable efforts to otherwise notify interested parties which may be affected by such contract or amendment, together with information indicating to whom comments or inquiries concerning the proposed actions can be addressed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide an opportunity for submission of written data, views and arguments, and shall consider all substantive comments so received.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In administering subsections (d) and (e) of section 485h of this title, the Secretary of the Interior shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) include in any long-term contract hereafter entered into under subsection (e) of section 485h of this title provision, if the other contracting party so requests, for renewal thereof under stated terms and conditions mutually agreeable to the parties. Such terms and conditions shall provide for an increase or decrease in the charges set forth in the contract to reflect, among other things, increases or decreases in construction, operation, and maintenance costs and improvement or deterioration in the party's repayment capacity. Any right of renewal shall be exercised within such reasonable time prior to the expiration of the contract as the parties shall have agreed upon and set forth therein;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) include in any long-term contract hereafter entered into under subsection (e) of section 485h of this title with a contracting organization provision, if the organization so requests, for conversion of said contract, under stated terms and conditions mutually agreeable to the parties, to a contract under subsection (d) of section 485h of this title at such time as, account being taken of the amount credited to return by the organization as hereinafter provided, the remaining amount of construction cost which is properly assignable for ultimate return by it can probably be repaid to the United States within the term of a contract under subsection (d) of section 485h of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) credit each year to every party which has entered into or which shall enter into a long-term contract pursuant to subsection (e) of section 485h of this title so much of the amount paid by said party on or before the due date as is in excess of the share of the operation and maintenance costs of the project which the Secretary finds is properly chargeable to that party. Credit for payments heretofore made under any such contract shall be established by the Secretary as soon after July 2, 1956 as it is feasible for him to do so. After the sum of such credits is equal to the amount which would have been for repayment by the party if a repayment contract under subsection (d) of section 485h of this title had been entered into, which amount shall be established by the Secretary upon completion of the project concerned or as far in advance thereof as is feasible, no construction component shall be included in any charges made for the furnishing of water to the contracting party and any charges theretofore fixed by contract or otherwise shall be reduced accordingly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that the other party to any contract entered into pursuant to subsection (d) of section 485h of this title or to any long-term contract entered into pursuant to subsection (e) of section 485h of this title shall, during the term of the contract and of any renewal thereof and subject to fulfillment of all obligations thereunder, have a first right (to which right the rights of the holders of any other type of irrigation water contract shall be subordinate) to a stated share or quantity of the project's available water supply for beneficial use on the irrigable lands within the boundaries of, or owned by, the party and a permanent right to such share or quantity upon completion of payment of the amount assigned for ultimate return by the party subject to payment of an appropriate share of such costs, if any, as may thereafter be incurred by the United States in its operation and maintenance of the project works; and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#485h-1_1_target" name="485h-1_1">1</a></sup></p>
