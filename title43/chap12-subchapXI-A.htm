<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Costs resulting from age and normal deterioration or lack of maintenance of structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Costs heretofore or hereafter incurred in the modification of structures under this subchapter, the cause of which results from age and normal deterioration of the structure or from nonperformance of reasonable and normal maintenance of the structure by the operating entity shall be considered as project costs and will be allocated to the purposes for which the structure was authorized initially to be constructed and will be reimbursable as provided by existing law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nonreimbursable costs resulting from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the $100,000,000 authorized to be appropriated in the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 [43 U.S.C. 509], costs heretofore or hereafter incurred in the modification of structures under this subchapter, the cause of which results from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art criteria deemed necessary for safety purposes shall be nonreimbursable and nonreturnable under the Federal Reclamation law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reimbursement of certain modification costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the additional amounts authorized to be appropriated by section 509 of this title, costs incurred in the modification of structures under this subchapter, the cause of which results from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art criteria deemed necessary for safety purposes, shall be reimbursed to the extent provided in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Costs allocated to irrigation water service and capable of being repaid by the irrigation water users shall be reimbursed within 50 years of the year in which the work undertaken pursuant to this subchapter is substantially complete.

The interest rate used shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the applicable reimbursement period during the month preceding the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred. To the extent that more than one interest rate is determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an interest rate at the weighted average of the rates so determined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contracts for return of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to negotiate appropriate contracts with project beneficiaries providing for the return of reimbursable costs under this subchapter: <em>Provided, however</em>, That no contract entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall be deemed to be a new or amended contract for the purposes of section 390cc(a) of this title.</p>
