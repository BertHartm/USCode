<p class="statutory-body">With respect to lands conveyed to Native Corporations or Native Groups the Secretary shall reserve only those easements which are described in section 17(b)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and shall be guided by the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all easements should be designed so as to minimize their impact on Native life styles, and on subsistence uses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) each easement should be specifically located and described and should include only such areas as are necessary for the purpose or purposes for which the easement is reserved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, after a conveyance has been made by this Act or under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], the Secretary determines that an easement not reserved at the time of conveyance or by operation of subsection (a) of this section is required for any purpose specified in section 17(b)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, he is authorized to acquire such easement by purchase or otherwise. The acquisition of such an easement shall be deemed a public purpose for which the Secretary may exercise his exchange authority pursuant to section 22(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1621(f)].</p>
