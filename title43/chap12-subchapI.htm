<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3002. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Nation needs an adequate water supply for all states [States] at a reasonable cost;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the demands on the Nation's finite water supply are increasing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) coordination on both the Federal level and the local level is needed to achieve water policy objectives;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) not less than fourteen agencies of the Federal Government are currently charged with functions relating to the oversight of water policy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the diverse authority over Federal water policy has resulted in unclear goals and an inefficient handling of the Nation's water policy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the conflict between competing goals and objectives by Federal, State, and local agencies as well as by private water users is particularly acute in the nineteen Western States which have arid climates which include the seventeen reclamation States, Hawaii, and Alaska;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the appropriations doctrine of water allocation which characterizes most western water management regimes varies from State to State, and results in many instances in increased competition for limited resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the Federal Government has recognized and continues to recognize the primary jurisdiction of the several States over the allocation, priority, and use of water resources of the States, except to the extent such jurisdiction has been preempted in whole or in part by the Federal Government, including, but not limited to, express or implied Federal reserved water rights either for itself or for the benefit of Indian Tribes, and that the Federal Government will, in exercising its authorities, comply with applicable State laws;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the Federal Government recognizes its trust responsibilities to protect Indian water rights and assist Tribes in the wise use of those resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Reclamation, have had, and will continue to have major responsibilities in assisting States in the wise management and allocation of scarce water resources; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the Secretary of the Interior, given his responsibilities for management of public land, trust responsibilities for Indians, administration of the reclamation program, investigations and reviews into ground water resources through the Geologic Survey [now United States Geological Survey], and the Secretary of the Army, given his responsibilities for flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement, have the resources to assist in a comprehensive review, in consultation with appropriate officials from the nineteen Western States, into the problems and potential solutions facing the nineteen Western States and the Federal Government in the increasing competition for the scarce water resources of the Western States.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3003. PRESIDENTIAL REVIEW.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The President is directed to undertake a comprehensive review of Federal activities in the nineteen Western States which directly or indirectly affect the allocation and use of water resources, whether surface or subsurface, and to submit a report on the President's findings, together with recommendations, if any, to the Committees on Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works and Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees on Natural Resources [now Resources], Public Works and Transportation [now Transportation and Infrastructure], Merchant Marine and Fisheries and Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>

Such irrigation works may be undertaken only after a report and findings thereon have been made by the Secretary of the Interior as provided in said Federal reclamation laws and after subsequent specific authorization of the Congress by an authorization Act; and, within the limits of the water users&rsquo; repayment ability such report may be predicated on the allocation to irrigation of an appropriate portion of the cost of structures and facilities used for irrigation and other purposes. Dams and reservoirs operated under the direction of the Secretary of the Army may be utilized after December 22, 1944, for irrigation purposes only in conformity with the provisions of this section, but the foregoing requirement shall not prejudice lawful uses now existing: <em>Provided</em>, That this section shall not apply to any dam or reservoir heretofore constructed in whole or in part by the Army engineers, which provides conservation storage of water for irrigation purposes. In the case of any reservoir project constructed and operated by the Corps of Engineers, the Secretary of the Army is authorized to allocate water which was allocated in the project purpose for municipal and industrial water supply and which is not under contract for delivery, for such periods as he may deem reasonable, for the interim use for irrigation purposes of such storage until such storage is required for municipal and industrial water supply.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;390b. Development of water supplies for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other purposes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of the Congress to recognize the primary responsibilities of the States and local interests in developing water supplies for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other purposes and that the Federal Government should participate and cooperate with States and local interests in developing such water supplies in connection with the construction, maintenance, and operation of Federal navigation, flood control, irrigation, or multiple purpose projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Storage in reservoir projects; agreements for payment of cost of construction or modification of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the policy set forth in this section, it is provided that storage may be included in any reservoir project surveyed, planned, constructed or to be planned, surveyed and/or constructed by the Corps of Engineers or the Bureau of Reclamation to impound water for present or anticipated future demand or need for municipal or industrial water, and the reasonable value thereof may be taken into account in estimating the economic value of the entire project: <em>Provided</em>, That the cost of any construction or modification authorized under the provi<!-- PDFPage:87 -->sions of this section shall be determined on the basis that all authorized purposes served by the project shall share equitably in the benefits of multiple purpose construction, as determined by the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Interior, as the case may be: <em>Provided further</em>, That before construction or modification of any project including water supply provisions for present demand is initiated, State or local interests shall agree to pay for the cost of such provisions in accordance with the provisions of this section: <em>And provided further</em>, That (1) for Corps of Engineers projects, not to exceed 30 percent of the total estimated cost of any project may be allocated to anticipated future demands, and, (2) for Bureau of Reclamation projects, not to exceed 30 per centum of the total estimated cost of any project may be allocated to anticipated future demands where State or local interests give reasonable assurances, and there is reasonable evidence, that such demands for the use of such storage will be made within a period of time which will permit paying out the costs allocated to water supply within the life of the project: <em>And provided further</em>, That for Corps of Engineers projects, the Secretary of the Army may permit the full non-Federal contribution to be made, without interest, during construction of the project, or, with interest, over a period of not more than thirty years from the date of completion, with repayment contracts providing for recalculation of the interest rate at, five-year intervals, and for Bureau of Reclamation projects, the entire amount of the construction costs, including interest during construction, allocated to water supply shall be repaid within the life of the project but in no event to exceed fifty years after the project is first used for the storage of water for water supply purposes, except that (1) no payment need be made with respect to storage for future water supply until such supply is first used, and (2) no interest shall be charged on such cost until such supply is first used, but in no case shall the interest-free period exceed ten years. For Corps of Engineers projects, all annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for municipal and industrial water supply storage under the provisions of this section shall be reimbursed from State or local interests on an annual basis. For Corps of Engineers projects, any repayment by a State or local interest shall be made with interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period, during the month preceding the fiscal year in which costs for the construction of the project are first incurred (or, when a recalculation is made), plus a premium of one-eighth of one percentage point for transaction costs. For Bureau of Reclamation projects, the interest rate used for purposes of computing interest during construction and interest on the unpaid balance shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which construction is initiated, on the basis of the computed average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations, which are neither due nor callable for redemption for fifteen years from date of issue. The provisions of this subsection insofar as they relate to the Bureau of Reclamation and the Secretary of the Interior shall be alternative to and not a substitute for the provisions of the Reclamation Projects Act of 1939 (53 Stat. 1187) [43 U.S.C. 485 et seq.] relating to the same subject.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application to other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not be construed to modify the provisions of section 701&ndash;1 of title 33 and section 390 of this title, as amended and extended, or the provisions of sections 372 and 383 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Approval of Congress of modifications of reservoir projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Modifications of a reservoir project heretofore authorized, surveyed, planned, or constructed to include storage as provided in subsection (b) of this section which would seriously affect the purposes for which the project was authorized, surveyed, planned, or constructed, or which would involve major structural or operational changes shall be made only upon the approval of Congress as now provided by law.</p>
