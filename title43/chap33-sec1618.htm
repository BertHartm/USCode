If two or more villages are located on such reserve, the election must be made by all of the members or stockholders of the Village Corporations concerned. In such event, the Secretary shall convey the land to the Village Corporation or Corporations, subject to valid existing rights as provided in section 1613(g) of this title, and the Village Corporation shall not be eligible for any other land selections under this chapter or <!-- PDFPage:438 -->to any distribution of Regional Corporations funds pursuant to section 1606 of this title, and the enrolled residents of the Village Corporation shall not be eligible to receive Regional Corporation stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restoration of land to Elim Native Corporation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) approximately 350,000 acres of land were withdrawn by Executive orders in 1917 for the use of the United States Bureau of Education and of the Natives of Indigenous Alaskan race;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) these lands comprised the Norton Bay Reservation (later referred to as Norton Bay Native Reserve) and were set aside for the benefit of the Native inhabitants of the Eskimo Village of Elim, Alaska;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in 1929, 50,000 acres of land were deleted from the Norton Bay Reservation by Executive order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the lands were deleted from the Reservation for the benefit of others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the deleted lands were not available to the Native inhabitants of Elim under subsection (b) of this section at the time of passage of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the deletion of these lands has been and continues to be a source of deep concern to the indigenous people of Elim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) until this matter is dealt with, it will continue to be a source of great frustration and sense of loss among the shareholders of the Elim Native Corporation and their descendants.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withdrawal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lands depicted and designated &ldquo;Withdrawal Area&rdquo; on the map dated October 19, 1999, along with their legal descriptions, on file with the Bureau of Land Management, and entitled &ldquo;Land Withdrawal Elim Native Corporation&rdquo;, are hereby withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights, from all forms of appropriation or disposition under the public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, for a period of 2 years from May 2, 2000, for selection by the Elim Native Corporation (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Elim&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authority to select and convey</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Elim is authorized to select in accordance with the rules set out in this paragraph, 50,000 acres of land (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Conveyance Lands&rdquo;) within the boundary of the Withdrawal Area described in paragraph (2). The Secretary is authorized and directed to convey to Elim in fee the surface and subsurface estates to 50,000 acres of valid selections in the Withdrawal Area, subject to the covenants, reservations, terms and conditions and other provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Elim shall have 2 years from May 2, 2000, in which to file its selection of no more than 60,000 acres of land from the area described in paragraph (2). The selection application shall be filed with the Bureau of Land Management, Alaska State Office, shall describe a single tract adjacent to United States Survey No. 2548, Alaska, and shall be reasonably compact, contiguous, and in whole sections except when separated by unavailable land or when the remaining entitlement is less than a whole section.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The selection filed by Elim pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to valid existing rights and may not supercede prior selections of the State of Alaska, any Native corporation, or valid entries of any private individual unless such selection or entry is relinquished, rejected, or abandoned prior to conveyance to Elim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Upon receipt of the Conveyance Lands, Elim shall have all legal rights and privileges as landowner, subject only to the covenants, reservations, terms and conditions specified in this subsection.</p>
