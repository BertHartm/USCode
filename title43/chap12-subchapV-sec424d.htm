Where water rental collections under sections 424 to 424e of this title are in excess of the current operation and maintenance charges, the excess as determined by the Secretary, shall, in the absence of such contrary contract provision, inure to the Reclamation Fund as above provided, but in all other cases the water rentals collected under sections 424 to 424e of this title shall be turned over to or retained by the operating district or association, where the project or part of the project from which the water rentals were collected is being operated and maintained by an irrigation district or water users association under contract with the United States.</p>
