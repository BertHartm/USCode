<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a large surplus of crude oil on the west coast of the United States is projected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any substantial curtailment of Canadian crude oil exports to the United States could create a severe crude oil shortage in the northern tier States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pending the authorization and completion of west-to-east crude oil delivery systems, Alaskan crude oil in excess of west coast needs will be transshipped through the Panama Canal at a high transportation cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) national security and regional supply requirements may be such that west-to-east crude delivery systems serving both the northern tier States and inland States, consistent with the requirements of section 410 of the Act approved November 16, 1973 (87 Stat. 594), commonly known as the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, are needed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) expeditious Federal and State decisions for west-to-east crude oil delivery systems are of the utmost priority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) resolution of the west coast crude oil surplus and the need for crude oil in northern tier States and inland States require the assignment and coordination of overall responsibility within the executive branch to permit expedited action on all necessary environmental assessments and decisions on permit applications concerning delivery systems.</p>

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the President from making his decision under section 2007(a) of this title in the absence of such report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this chapter shall bar the Attorney General or any other appropriate officer or agent of the United States from challenging any anticompetitive act or practice related to the ownership, construction, or operation of any crude oil transportation system approved under this chapter. The approval of any such system under this chapter shall not be deemed to convey to any person immunity from civil or criminal liability or to create defenses to actions under the antitrust laws and shall not modify or abridge any private right of action under such laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Filing and review of permits, rights-of-way applications, etc., not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the acceptance and review by any Federal agency of any application for any Federal permit, right-of-way, or other authorizations under other provisions of law for a crude oil transportation system eligible for consideration under this chapter; except that any determination with respect to such an application may be made only in accordance with the provisions of section 2009(a) of this title.</p>

A decision approving a crude oil transportation system may include such modifications and alterations in such system as the President finds appropriate. The President shall issue his decision within 45 days after receiving recommendations and comments submitted to him under section 2005(c) of this title, except that the President, for such period as he deems necessary, but not to exceed 60 days, may delay his decision and its issuance if he determines that additional time is otherwise necessary to enable him to make a decision. If the President so delays his decision, he shall promptly notify the House of Representatives and the Senate of such delay and shall submit a full explanation of the basis for such delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any decision made under this subsection approving a system proposed under this chapter shall include a determination that construction and operation of such system is in the national interest and shall be based upon the criteria specified in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) construction schedules for each of such systems and possibilities for delay in such schedules;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) feasibility of financing for each of such systems;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) net national economic costs and benefits of each such system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) the extent to which each system complies with the provisions of section 410 of the Act approved November 16, 1973 (87 Stat. 594), commonly known as the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the effect of each such system on international relations, including the status and time schedule for any necessary Canadian approvals and plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) impact upon competition by each system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) degree of safety and efficiency of design and operation of each system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(L) potential for interruption of deliveries of crude oil from the west coast under each such system;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:543 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(M) capacity and cost of expanding such system to transport additional volumes of crude oil in excess of initial system capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(N) national security considerations under each such system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(O) relationship of each such system to national energy policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(P) such other factors as the President deems appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The period of time for which such findings shall be made shall be the useful life of the crude oil transportation system involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Publication of findings and decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall make available to the public at the time of issuance of a decision under this section a written statement setting forth findings with respect to each of the criteria specified in subsection (b) of this section and describing the nature and route of crude oil transportation systems, if any, which are approved in the decision. If the President's decision is to approve a system, each statement shall set forth his reasons for approving such system over other proposed systems (if any) eligible for consideration under this chapter. Such statement along with notification of such decision shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
