<p class="statutory-body">(2) The reimbursable portion of the total costs shall be allocated between the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund established by section 5(a) of the Colorado River Storage Project Act (70 Stat. 107) [43 U.S.C. 620d(a)] and the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund established by section 1543(a) of this title, after consultation with the Advisory Council created in section 1594(a) of this title and consideration of the following items:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) benefits to be derived in each basin from the use of water of improved quality and the use of works for improved water management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) causes of salinity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) availability of revenues in the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund and increased revenues to the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund made available under section 620d(d)(5) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That costs allocated to the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund under this paragraph (2) shall not exceed 15 per centum of the costs allocated to the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund and the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(i) Costs of construction and replacement of each unit or separable feature thereof authorized by paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 1592&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1595_4_target" name="1595_4">4</a></sup> of this title, costs of construction of measures to replace incidental fish and wildlife values foregone, when such measures are a part of the on-farm measures authorized by section 1592(c) of this title or of the units authorized by paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 1592&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1595_4_target" name="1595_4">4</a></sup> of this title, and costs of implementation of the on-farm measures authorized by section 1592(c) of this title allocated to the upper basin and to the lower basin under subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be repaid as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), respectively, of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Costs allocated to the lower basin shall be repaid without interest as such costs are incurred to the extent that money is available from the Lower Colorado River Basin development fund to repay costs allocated to the lower basin. If in any fiscal year the money available from the Lower Colorado River Basin development fund for such repayment is insufficient to repay the costs allocated to the lower basin, as provided in the preceding sentence, the deficiency shall be repaid with interest as soon as money becomes available in the fund for repayment of those costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The interest rates used pursuant to this chapter shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period during the month preceding October 30, 1984, for costs outstanding at that date, or, in the case of costs incurred subsequent to October 30, 1984, during the month preceding the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred.</p>
