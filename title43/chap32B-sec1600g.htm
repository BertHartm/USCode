No provision of this chapter shall be construed to invalidate any provision of State, tribal, or local law unless there is a direct conflict between such provision and the law of the State, or political subdivision of the State or tribe, so that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. Inconsistencies shall be reviewed by the task force, and the task force shall make recommendations concerning such local laws. This chapter shall in no way be interpreted to interfere with a State's or tribe's right to protect, rehabilitate, preserve, and restore lands within its established boundary.</p>
