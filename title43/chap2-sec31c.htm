<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) maps and mapping techniques which achieve the objectives specified in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The objectives of the geologic mapping program shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) determining the Nation's geologic framework through systematic development of geologic maps at scales appropriate to the geologic setting and the perceived applications, such maps to be contributed to the national geologic map&nbsp;<sup><a href="#31c_1_target" name="31c_1">1</a></sup> data base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) development of a complementary national geophysical-map data base, geochemical-map data base, and a geochronologic and paleontologic data base that provide value-added descriptive and interpretative information to the geologic-map data base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) application of cost-effective mapping techniques that assemble, produce, translate and disseminate geologic-map information and that render such information of greater application and benefit to the public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) development of public awareness of the role and application of geologic-map information to the resolution of national issues of land use management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Program components</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The geologic mapping program shall include the following components:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal component</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Federal geologic mapping component, whose objective shall be determining the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to the economic, social, or scientific welfare of the Nation. Mapping priorities shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) national requirements for geologic-map information in areas of multiple-issue need or areas of compelling single-issue need; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:10 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) national requirements for geologic-map information in areas where mapping is required to solve critical earth-science problems.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Support component</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A geologic mapping support component, whose objective shall be providing interdisciplinary support for the Federal Geologic Mapping Component. Representative categories of interdisciplinary support shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishment of a national geologic-map data base, established pursuant to section 31f of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) studies that lead to the implementation of cost-effective digital methods for the acquisition, compilation, analysis, cartographic production, and dissemination of geologic-map information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) paleontologic investigations that provide information critical to understanding the age and depositional environment of fossil-bearing geologic-map units, which investigations shall be contributed to a national paleontologic data base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) geochronologic and isotopic investigations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provide radiometric age dates for geologic-map units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) fingerprint the geothermometry, geobarometry, and alteration history of geologic-map units,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">which investigations shall be contributed to a national geochronologic data base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) geophysical investigations that assist in delineating and mapping the physical characteristics and three-dimensional distribution of geologic materials and geologic structures, which investigations shall be contributed to a national geophysical-map data base; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) geochemical investigations and analytical operations that characterize the major- and minor-element composition of geologic-map units, and that lead to the recognition of stable and anomalous geochemical signatures for geologic terrains, which investigations shall be contributed to a national geochemical-map data base.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State component</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State geologic mapping component, whose objective shall be determining the geologic framework of areas that the State geological surveys determine to be vital to the economic, social, or scientific welfare of individual States. Mapping priorities shall be determined by multirepresentational State panels and shall be integrated with national priorities. Federal funding for the State component shall be matched on a one-to-one basis with non-Federal funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Education component</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A geologic mapping education component&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the objectives of which shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to develop the academic programs that teach earth-science students the fundamental principles of geologic mapping and field analysis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to provide for broad education in geologic mapping and field analysis through support of field studies;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) investigations under which shall be integrated with the other mapping components of the geologic mapping program and shall respond to priorities identified for those components; and</p>
