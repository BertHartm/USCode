<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Meandering in the surveying of submerged land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), whenever the Secretary surveys land selected by a Native, a Native Corporation, or the State pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], the Alaska Statehood Act, or this Act, lakes, rivers, and streams shall be meandered in accordance with the principles <!-- PDFPage:448 -->in the Bureau of Land Management, &ldquo;Manual of Surveying Instructions&rdquo; (1973).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If title to lands beneath navigable waters of a lake less than fifty acres in size or a river or stream less than three chains in width did not vest in the State pursuant to the Submerged Lands Act [43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq., 1311 et seq.], such lake, river, or stream shall not be meandered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary is not required to determine the navigability of a lake, river, or stream which because of its size or width is required to be meandered or to compute the acreage of the land beneath such lake, river, or stream or to describe such land in any conveyance document.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require ground survey or monumentation of meanderlines.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ownership of riparian lands; ratification of memorandum of agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever, either before or after August 16, 1988, the Secretary conveys land to a Native, a Native Corporation, or the State pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], the Alaska Statehood Act, or this Act which abuts or surrounds a meanderable lake, river, or stream, all right, title, and interest of the United States, if any, in the land under such lake, river, or stream lying between the uplands and the median line or midpoint, as the case may be, shall vest in and shall not be charged against the acreage entitlement of such Native or Native Corporation or the State. The right, title, and interest vested in a Native or Native Corporation shall be no greater an estate than the estate he or it is conveyed in the land which abuts or surrounds the lake, river, or stream.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The specific terms, conditions, procedures, covenants, reservations, and other restrictions set forth in the document entitled, &ldquo;Memorandum of Agreement between the United States Department of the Interior and the State of Alaska&rdquo; dated March 28, 1984, signed by the Secretary and the Governor of Alaska and submitted to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, are hereby incorporated in this section and are ratified as to the duties and obligations of the United States and the State, as a matter of Federal law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interim conveyances and patents; navigability of streams; award of costs and attorney's fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The execution of an interim conveyance or patent, as appropriate, by the Bureau of Land Management which conveys an area of land selected by a Native or Native Corporation which includes, surrounds, or abuts a lake, river, or stream, or any portion thereof, shall be the final agency action with respect to a decision of the Secretary of the Interior that such lake, river, or stream, is or is not navigable, unless such decision was validly appealed to an agency or board of the Department of the Interior on or before December 2, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No agency or board of the Department of the Interior other than the Bureau of Land Management shall have authority to determine the navigability of a lake, river, or stream within an area selected by a Native or Native Corporation pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] or this Act unless a determination by the Bureau of Land Management that such lake, river, or stream, is or is not navigable, was validly appealed to such agency or board on or before December 2, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If title to land conveyed to a Native Corporation pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] or this Act which underlies a lake, river, or stream is challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction and such court determines that such land is owned by the Native Corporation, the Native Corporation shall be awarded a money judgment against the plaintiffs in an amount equal to its costs and attorney's fees, including costs and attorney's fees incurred on appeal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;navigable&rdquo; and &ldquo;navigability&rdquo; means navigable for the purpose of determining title to lands beneath navigable waters, as between the United States and the several States pursuant to the Submerged Lands Act [43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq., 1311 et seq.] and section 6(m) of the Alaska Statehood Act.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment; agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to enhance the quantity and quality of Alaska's renewable resources and to facilitate the coordinated management and protection of Federal, State, and Native and other private lands, there is hereby established the Alaska Land Bank Program. Any private landowner is authorized as provided in this section to enter into a written agreement with the Secretary if his lands adjoin, or his use of such lands would directly affect, Federal land, Federal and State land, or State land if the State is not participating in the program. Any private landowner described in subsection (d)(1) of this section whose lands do not adjoin, or whose use of such lands would not directly affect either Federal or State lands also is entitled to enter into an agreement with the Secretary. Any private landowner whose lands adjoin, or whose use of such lands would directly affect, only State, or State and private lands, is authorized as provided in this section to enter into an agreement with the State of Alaska if the State is participating in the program. If the Secretary is the contracting party with the private landowner, he shall afford the State an opportunity to participate in negotiations and become a party to the agreement. An agreement may include all or part of the lands of any private landowner: <em>Provided</em>, That no lands shall be included in the agreement un<!-- PDFPage:460 -->less the Secretary, or the State, determines that the purposes of the program will be promoted by their inclusion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a private landowner consents to the inclusion in an agreement of the stipulations provided in subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(7) of this section, and if such owner does not insist on any additional terms which are unacceptable to the Secretary or the State, as appropriate, the owner shall be entitled to enter into an agreement pursuant to this section. If an agreement is not executed within one hundred and twenty days of the date on which a private landowner communicates in writing his consent to the stipulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the appropriate Secretary or State agency head shall execute an agreement. Upon such execution, the private owner shall receive the benefits provided in subsection (c) hereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No agreement under this section shall be construed as affecting any land, or any right or interest in land, of any owner not a party to such agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms of agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each agreement referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall have an initial term of ten years, with provisions, if any, for renewal for additional periods of five years. Such agreement shall contain the following terms:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The landowner shall not alienate, transfer, assign, mortgage, or pledge the lands subject to the agreement except as provided in section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(c)], or permit development or improvement on such lands except as provided in the agreement. For the purposes of this section only, each agreement entered into with a landowner described in subsection (d)(1) of this section shall constitute a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States upon the lands subject to the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Lands subject to the agreement shall be managed by the owner in a manner compatible with the management plan, if any, for the adjoining Federal or State lands, and with the requirements of this subsection. If lands subject to the agreement do not adjoin either Federal or State lands, they shall be managed in a manner compatible with the management plan, if any, of Federal or State lands which would be directly affected by the use of such private lands. If no such plan has been adopted, or if the use of such private lands would not directly affect either Federal or State lands, the owner shall manage such lands in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (1) of this subsection. Except as provided in (3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1636_1_target" name="1636_1">1</a></sup> of this subsection, nothing in this section or the management plan of any Federal or State agency shall be construed to require a private landowner to grant public access on or across his lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If the surface landowner so consents, such lands may be made available for local or other recreational use: <em>Provided</em>, That the refusal of a private landowner to permit the uses referred to in this subsection shall not be grounds for the refusal of the Secretary or the State to enter into an agreement with the landowner under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Appropriate Federal and/or State agency heads shall have reasonable access to such privately owned land for purposes relating to the administration of the adjoining Federal or State lands, and to carry out their obligations under the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Reasonable access to such land by officers of the State shall be permitted for purposes of conserving fish and wildlife.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Those services or other consideration which the appropriate Secretary or the State shall provide to the owner pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section shall be set forth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) All or part of the lands subject to the agreement may be withdrawn from the Alaska land bank program not earlier than ninety days after the landowner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) submits written notice thereof to the other parties which are signatory to the agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pays all Federal, State and local property taxes and assessments which, during the particular term then in effect, would have been incurred except for the agreement, together with interest on such taxes and assessments in an amount to be determined at the highest rate of interest charged with respect to delinquent property taxes by the Federal, State or local taxing authority, if any.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The agreement may contain such additional terms, which are consistent with the provisions of this section, as seem desirable to the parties entering into the agreement: <em>Provided</em>, That the refusal of the landowner to agree to any additional terms shall not be grounds for the refusal of the Secretary or the State to enter into an agreement with the landowner under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Benefits to private landowners</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to any requirement of applicable law, the appropriate Secretary is authorized to provide technical and other assistance with respect to fire control, trespass control, resource and land use planning, and the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of any special values of the land subject to the agreement, all with or without reimbursement as agreed upon by the parties, so long as the landowner is in compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provision of section 21(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1620(e)] shall apply to all lands which are subject to an agreement made pursuant to this section so long as the parties to the agreement are in compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Automatic protections for lands conveyed pursuant to Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or doctrine of equity, all land and interests in land in Alaska conveyed by the Federal Government pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] to a Native individual or Native Corporation or subsequently reconveyed by a Native Corporation <!-- PDFPage:461 -->pursuant to section 39 of that Act [43 U.S.C. 1629e] to a Settlement Trust or conveyed to a Native Corporation pursuant to an exchange authorized by section 22(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1621(f)] or section 3192(h) of title 16 or other applicable law shall be exempt, so long as such land and interests are not developed or leased or sold to third parties from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) adverse possession and similar claims based upon estoppel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) real property taxes by any governmental entity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) judgments resulting from a claim based upon or arising under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) title 11 or any successor statute,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) other insolvency or moratorium laws, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) other laws generally affecting creditors&rsquo; rights;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) judgments in any action at law or in equity to recover sums owed or penalties incurred by a Native Corporation or Settlement Trust or any employee, officer, director, or shareholder of such corporation or trust, unless this exemption is contractually waived prior to the commencement of such action; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) &ldquo;Developed&rdquo; means a purposeful modification of land, or an interest in land, from its original state that effectuates a condition of gainful and productive present use without further substantial modification. Any such modification shall be performed by the Native individual or Native Corporation. Surveying, construction of roads, providing utilities, or other similar actions, which are normally considered to be component parts of the development process but do not create the condition described in the preceding sentence, shall not constitute a developed state within the meaning of this clause. In order to terminate the exemptions listed in paragraph (1), land, or an interest in land, must be developed for purposes other than exploration, and the exemptions will be terminated only with respect to the smallest practicable tract actually used in the developed state. Any lands previously developed by third-party trespassers shall not be considered to have been developed.;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1636_3_target" name="1636_3">3</a></sup></p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) land shall not be considered developed solely as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the construction, installation, or placement upon such land of any structure, fixture, device, or other improvement intended to enable, assist, or otherwise further subsistence uses or other customary or traditional uses of such land, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the receipt of fees related to hunting, fishing, and guiding activities conducted on such land;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) land upon which timber resources are being harvested shall be considered developed only during the period of such harvest and only to the extent that such land is integrally related to the timber harvesting operation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) lands or interest in lands shall not be considered developed or leased or sold to a third party as a result of an exchange or conveyance of such land or interest in land between or among Native Corporations and trusts, partnerships, corporations, or joint ventures, whose beneficiaries, partners, shareholders, or joint venturers are Native Corporations.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">any right, title, or interest in any land, or interests in land, subject to the exemptions described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The prohibitions of subparagraph (A) shall not apply&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the exemptions listed in paragraph (1) are terminated with respect to land, or an interest in land, as a result of development (or a lease to a third party), and such land, or interest in land, subsequently reverts to an undeveloped state (or the third-party lease is terminated), then the exemptions shall again apply to such land, or interest in land, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Tax Recapture Upon Subdivision Plat Recordation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Upon the recordation with an appropriate government authority of an approved subdivision plat submitted by, or on behalf of, a Native individual, Native Corporation, or Settlement Trust with respect to land described in paragraph (1), such individual, corporation, or trust shall pay in accordance with this paragraph all State and local property taxes on the smallest practicable tract integrally related to the subdivision project that would have been incurred by the individual, corporation, or trust on such land (excluding the value of subsurface resources and timber) in the absence of the exemption described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) during the thirty months prior to the date of the recordation of the plat.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Optional procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall be applicable only to the conveyance of Federal lands described herein to a Native Corporation which within one hundred and eighty days after December 2, 1980, or the date of eligibility determination, whichever is later, files a document with the Secretary setting forth its election to receive conveyance pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Core&rdquo; townships, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except to the extent that conveyance of a surface estate would be inconsistent with section 12(a), 14(a), 14(b), or 22(<em>l</em>) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(a), 1613(a), 1613(b), or 1621(<em>l</em>)], subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation for a Native Village which is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for land under section 11 or 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1610 or 1615] and which did not elect to acquire a former reserve under section 19(b) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1618(b)], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the surface estate in the public lands, as defined in such Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], in the township or townships withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(1) or 16(a) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1) or 1615(a)] in which all or any part of such Village is located. As used in this paragraph the term &ldquo;Native Village&rdquo; has the same meaning such term has in section 3(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1602(c)].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Where two or more Village Corporations are entitled to the same land by virtue of the same township or townships embracing all or part of the Native Villages, the conveyance made by paragraph (A) shall not be effective as to such lands until an arbitration decision or other binding agreement between or among the Corporations is filed with and published by the Secretary. Within thirty days of receipt of such decision or agreement, the Secretary shall publish notice of the decision or agreement in the Federal Register. Effective with such publication, title to the lands conveyed by subparagraph (A) shall vest in the Village Corporation as specified in the decision or agreement. For purposes of section 1632 of this title, until title vests in the Village Corporation pursuant to this subparagraph, the Secretary shall consider the entire acreage involved chargeable to each Corporation's entitlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except to the extent that conveyance of a surface estate would be inconsistent with section 12(a), 14(a), or 22(<em>l</em>) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(a), 1613(a), or 1621(<em>l</em>)], subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation for a Native Village which is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for land under section 11 of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1610], and which did not elect to acquire a former reserve under section 19(b) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1618(b)], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the surface estate in the township or townships withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(2) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(2)] in which all or any part of such village is located: <em>Provided</em>, That any such land reserved to or selected by the State of Alaska under the Acts of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1214), as amended, January 21, <!-- PDFPage:465 -->1929 (45 Stat. 1091), as amended, or July 28, 1956 (70 Stat. 709), and lands selected by the State which have been tentatively approved to the State under section 6(g) of the Alaska Statehood Act and as to which the State, prior to December 18, 1971, had conditionally granted title to, or contracts to purchase, the surface estate to third parties, including cities and boroughs within the State, and such reservations, selections, grants, and contracts had not expired or been relinquished or revoked by December 2, 1980, shall not be conveyed by operation of this paragraph: <em>And provided further</em>, That the provisions of subparagraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall apply to the conveyances under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation which, by December 2, 1980, is determined by the Secretary to be eligible under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] to, and has elected to, acquire title to any estate pursuant to section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1618(b)], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the estates in a reserve, as such reserve existed on December 18, 1971, which was set aside for the use or benefit of the stockholders or members of such Corporation before December 18, 1971. Nothing in this paragraph shall apply to the Village Corporation for the Native village of Klukwan, which Corporation shall receive those rights granted to it by the Act of January 2, 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;204) as amended by the Act of October 4, 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;456).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, and except where such lands are within a National Wildlife Refuge or the National Petroleum Reserve&mdash;Alaska, for which the Regional Corporation obtains in-lieu rights pursuant to section 12(a)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(a)(1)], there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Regional Corporation which, as a result of a conveyance of a surface estate by operation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, is entitled under section 14(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(f)] to receive the subsurface estate corresponding to such surface estate, all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to such subsurface estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as possible after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall issue to each Native Corporation referred to in subsection (b) of this section interim conveyances or patents to the estate or estates conveyed to such Corporation by such subsection, but title shall be deemed to have passed on the date of the filing of a document of election described in subsection (a) of this section, notwithstanding any delay in the issuance of the interim conveyances or patents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reconveyances; disputes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A Village Corporation's obligation to reconvey lands under section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(c)] shall arise only upon receipt of an interim conveyance or patent, whichever is earlier, under subsection (c) of this section or under such Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.].
