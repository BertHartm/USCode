<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) there is an immediate need for a fair and just settlement of all claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska, based on aboriginal land claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) the settlement should be accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in conformity with <!-- PDFPage:381 -->the real economic and social needs of Natives, without litigation, with maximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their rights and property, without establishing any permanent racially defined institutions, rights, privileges, or obligations, without creating a reservation system or lengthy wardship or trusteeship, and without adding to the categories of property and institutions enjoying special tax privileges or to the legislation establishing special relationships between the United States Government and the State of Alaska;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) no provision of this chapter shall replace or diminish any right, privilege, or obligation of Natives as citizens of the United States or of Alaska, or relieve, replace, or diminish any obligation of the United States or of the State or Alaska to protect and promote the rights or welfare of Natives as citizens of the United States or of Alaska; the Secretary is authorized and directed, together with other appropriate agencies of the United States Government, to make a study of all Federal programs primarily designed to benefit Native people and to report back to the Congress with his recommendations for the future management and operation of these programs within three years of December 18, 1971;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) no provision of this chapter shall constitute a precedent for reopening, renegotiating, or legislating upon any past settlement involving land claims or other matters with any Native organizations, or any tribe, band, or identifiable group of American Indians;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) no provision of this chapter shall effect a change or changes in the petroleum reserve policy reflected in sections 7421 through 7438&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1601_1_target" name="1601_1">1</a></sup> of title 10 except as specifically provided in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) no provision of this chapter shall be construed to constitute a jurisdictional act, to confer jurisdiction to sue, nor to grant implied consent to Natives to sue the United States or any of its officers with respect to the claims extinguished by the operation of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(g) no provision of this chapter shall be construed to terminate or otherwise curtail the activities of the Economic Development Administration or other Federal agencies conducting loan or loan and grant programs in Alaska. For this purpose only, the terms &ldquo;Indian reservation&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust or restricted Indian-owned land areas&rdquo; in Public Law 89&ndash;136, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended [42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq.], shall be interpreted to include lands granted to Natives under this chapter as long as such lands remain in the ownership of the Native villages or the Regional Corporations.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;241, &sect;2, Feb. 3, 1988, 101 Stat. 1788, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [this chapter] was enacted in 1971 to achieve a fair and just settlement of all aboriginal land and hunting and fishing claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska with maximum participation by Natives in decisions affecting their rights and property;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the settlement enabled Natives to participate in the subsequent expansion of Alaska's economy, encouraged efforts to address serious health and welfare problems in Native villages, and sparked a resurgence of interest in the cultural heritage of the Native peoples of Alaska;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) despite these achievements and Congress's desire that the settlement be accomplished rapidly without litigation and in conformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives, the complexity of the land conveyance process and frequent and costly litigation have delayed implementation of the settlement and diminished its value;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Natives have differing opinions as to whether the Native Corporation, as originally structured by <!-- PDFPage:382 -->the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, is well adapted to the reality of life in Native villages and to the continuation of traditional Native cultural values;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to ensure the continued success of the settlement and to guarantee Natives continued participation in decisions affecting their rights and property, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act must be amended to enable the shareholders of each Native Corporation to structure the further implementation of the settlement in light of their particular circumstances and needs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) among other things, the shareholders of each Native Corporation must be permitted to decide&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) when restrictions on alienation of stock issued as part of the settlement should be terminated, and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) whether Natives born after December 18, 1971, should participate in the settlement;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) by granting the shareholders of each Native Corporation options to structure the further implementation of the settlement, Congress is not expressing an opinion on the manner in which such shareholders choose to balance individual rights and communal rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) no provision of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note above] shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) unless specifically provided, constitute a repeal or modification, implied or otherwise, of any provision of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) confer on, or deny to, any Native organization any degree of sovereign governmental authority over lands (including management, or regulation of the taking, of fish and wildlife) or persons in Alaska; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and this Act are Indian legislation enacted by Congress pursuant to its plenary authority under the Constitution of the United States to regulate Indian affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Judicial Review</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) the denial of dissenters rights after the rejection of an amendment to terminate alienability restrictions pursuant to section 37(b) of such Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">such civil action shall be barred unless it is filed within one year after the date of the shareholder vote authorizing such issuance or distribution, extension of restrictions, or denial of right, and unless a request for a declaratory judgment or injunctive relief is made before stock is issued or distributed.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) No money judgment shall be entered against the United States in a civil action subject to this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of the limitation on civil actions established by this section is&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to ensure that after the expiration of a reasonable period of time, Native Shareholders, Native Corporations, the United States, and the State of Alaska and its political subdivisions will be able to plan their affairs with certainty in full reliance on the provisions of this Act, and</p>
