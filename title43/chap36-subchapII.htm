For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;resulting economic loss&rdquo; means the gross income, as estimated by the Secretary, that a commercial fisherman who is eligible for compensation under this section will lose by reason of not being able to engage in fishing, or having to reduce his fishing effort, during the period before the damaged or lost fishing gear concerned is repaired or replaced and available for use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, no payment may be made by the Secretary from the Fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the extent that damages were caused by the negligence or fault of the commercial fisherman making the claim;</p>
