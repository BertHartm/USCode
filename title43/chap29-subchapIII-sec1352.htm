<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any action commenced against the Federal Government or a State pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Federal Government or such State, as the case may be, may not raise as a defense (A) any claim of sovereign immunity, or (B) any claim that the employee who revealed the privileged information which is the basis of such suit was acting outside the scope of his employment in revealing such information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Preemption of State law by Federal law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any provision of State or local law which provides for public access to any privileged information received or obtained by any person pursuant to this subchapter is expressly preempted by the provisions of this section, to the extent that it applies to such information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Failure by State to comply with regulations; withholding of information</h4>
