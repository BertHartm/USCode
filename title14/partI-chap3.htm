The Secretary shall prescribe the percentages applicable to the grades of lieutenant, lieutenant (junior grade), and ensign.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary shall, at least once each year, make a computation to determine the number of officers on the active duty promotion list authorized to be serving in each grade.

In making computations under this section the nearest whole number shall be regarded as the authorized number in any case where there is a fraction in the final result.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The numbers resulting from such computations shall be for all purposes the authorized number in each grade, except that the authorized number for a grade is temporarily increased during the period between one computation and the next by the number of officers originally appointed in that grade during that period and the number of officers of that grade for whom vacancies exist in the next higher grade but whose promotion has been delayed for any reason.</p>
