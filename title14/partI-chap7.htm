<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">In connection with its maritime police, promoting safety of life and property at sea, and aiding navigation functions, the Coast Guard frequently finds it advisable to utilize the services of other agencies and correlatively, frequently finds its facilities useful to other agencies. This high degree of cooperation, a natural attribute of a producing and servicing agency, is important not only because it greatly promotes the quantity and quality of the services performed, but because the concentration of these functions in one agency results in savings to the Government of man-power, funds, and equipment. In the belief that legislative recognition of and specific power to continue this needed cooperation are desirable, Chapter 7 of this title contains a group of sections on cooperation with designated agencies. This is not meant to be a complete listing of cooperating agencies, but rather the designation of the principal ones. In addition, the first section of the chapter deals with availability of Coast Guard personnel and facilities to other agencies and the availability of other agency personnel and facilities to the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for the Coast Guard to deal with foreign governments, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard and the State Department agree that a provision such as this is desirable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes it more and more necessary for the Service to be an initiating or participating agency in international collaboration. Examples of international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international telecommunications. It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road, safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels. Provisions for similar relationship between the Civil Aeronautical Board and the State Department appear in the act of June 23, 1938, as amended, 52 Stat. 984 (title 49, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;425(c), 602). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">This section outlines the sphere of cooperation between the Weather Bureau and the Coast Guard. It would not permit any cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the Weather Bureau, positive recognition of this has never appeared in the statutes. In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life saving activities, the Coast Guard finds it important to make, receive and transmit weather observations and measurements. Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting, particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work, assumed increasing importance, and this extensive weather station manning in cooperation with the Weather Bureau must be provided for in the postwar period. This section providing for such close cooperation with the Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the cooperative practices of the two agencies as they have operated for years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Experience since the war has indicated the necessity for making provision for the assignment of Coast Guard officers to diplomatic missions in those foreign countries which are extensively engaged in maritime commerce with the United States. This is largely the result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the State Department, of Coast Guard officers to be officially attached to diplomatic missions of the United States. Although Coast Guard advice on Coast Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic missions, in those locations where such advice and information are frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization of Coast Guard services would be achieved by having Coast Guard officers attached to such missions. Provision for customs officers to be attached to diplomatic missions is contained in the act of March 4, 1923, as amended, 42 Stat. 1453 (title 19, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;6). Before the transfer in 1939 of the Foreign Agriculture Service to the State Department, representatives of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture stationed abroad were agricultural attache�AE1s. Act of June 5, 1930, 46 Stat. 498 (title 7, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;542(a)). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
