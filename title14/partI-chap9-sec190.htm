<p class="statutory-body">Professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors in the Coast Guard shall be subject to retirement or discharge from active service for any cause on the same basis as other commissioned officers of the Coast Guard, except that they shall not be required to retire from active service under the provisions of section 288 of this title, nor shall they be subject to the provisions of section 289 of this title, nor shall they be required to retire at age sixty-two but may be permitted to serve until age sixty-four at which time unless earlier retired or separated they shall be retired.

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;15f (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, &sect;5, 50 Stat. 67).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision prohibiting the retirement of a professor because of physical disability with less than 15 years&rsquo; service is changed to have application only during the temporary appointment of a professor.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section provides for the retirement of associate professors, assistant professors, and commissioned instructors in addition to professors. It is believed that the provision of existing law requiring 15 years&rsquo; service before becoming eligible for retirement, discriminated against this group of officers as no other group was discriminated against, and should be eliminated. It was changed so that these officers would be ineligible for retirement during their probationary term only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
