Such a suspension may not continue beyond six months after the termination of the war or national emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the preceding sections of this chapter relating to selection and promotion of officers are suspended in accordance with subsection (a), and the needs of the service require, the President may, under regulations prescribed by him, promote to a higher grade any officer serving on active duty in the grade of ensign or above in the Coast Guard.</p>

Any other appointments under this section shall be made by the President alone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) An appointment under this section, unless expressly declined, is regarded as accepted on the date specified by the Secretary as the date of the appointment, and the officer so promoted is entitled to pay and allowances of the grade to which appointed from that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) An appointment under this section does not terminate any appointments held by an officer concerned under any other provisions of this title.

The President may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint officers on the reestablished active duty promotion list to fill vacancies in the authorized active duty strength of each grade. Such appointments shall be considered to have been made under section 271 of this title.</p>
