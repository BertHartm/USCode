<p class="note-body">Chapter 13 of this title deals with pay, allowances, awards, and other rights and benefits for personnel of the Coast Guard.

There is no intention to amend, enlarge or curtail the Pay Readjustment Act of 1942, as amended. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;20a, 121 (May 18, 1920, ch. 190, &sect;8, 41 Stat. 603; June 10, 1922, ch. 212, 42 Stat. 625; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, &sect;10, 44 Stat. 817).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 121 was omitted from the 1940 and 1946 editions of the U.S. Code, but it has been held that the assimilation provision thereof is inoperative only insofar as Congress has made specific legislative provision for the Coast Guard, and that benefits derived from legislation pertaining to the Navy previously conferred upon the Coast Guard, and not provided for in subsequent legislation, survive to the Coast Guard under the assimilation statute. (See 27 Comp. Dec. 234; 22 Comp. Gen. 723; decision of June 9, 1947, B&ndash;63472; decision of April 2, 1948, B&ndash;70438; and decision of September 2, 1948, B&ndash;77295.)</p>
<p class="note-body">It seems desirable to retain this assimilation provision as to pay in order to cover any failure to provide specifically for the Coast Guard in military pay legislation.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section assimilates the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard to the pay of military personnel of the Navy. It seems that this is the most feasible method of insuring that the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard will not vary from the pay of military personnel of the other armed forces. The assimilation is intended to include authorization for extra pay and allowances as provided for personnel of the Navy, for all types of special duty: for example, qualified divers on diving duty, military personnel assigned to submarine duty, military personnel assigned to aviation duty, officers assigned as aides to flag officers, and enlisted persons assigned to duty in the mess detail. Military pay acts are intended to include Coast Guard personnel specifically; this section would cover any failure to so provide for Coast Guard personnel in a pay act.</p>

(a) and (b) of this section, which provided respectively for the awarding of the same pay and allowances as prescribed for corresponding ranks, grades, or ratings for personnel of the Navy and for the withholding of pay of officers on account of indebtedness to the United States, since this appears to have been the intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub.

The Secretary is also authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public quarters, without rental charge, to military personnel who are on sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do not have dependents. Such authority shall be effective in any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. When any such lease involves housing facilities in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five years, and, in accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be made for the lease. Such public housing facilities may be leased on an individual or multiple-unit basis. Expenditures for the rental of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense in any year except where the Secretary finds that the average is so low as to prevent rental of necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is authorized to reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that rental expenditures in such areas exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved by the President&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;193, 194, 195, 196 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, &sect;7, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;12, 20 Stat. 165; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, &sect;9, 22 Stat. 57; Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 83, 29 Stat. 494).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of Life-saving medals turn on whether or not the United States has an interest in the heroic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional grounds. Under existing law the award of a medal could be made in any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen of the United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United States regardless of where the rescue took place; and if the rescue took place within waters of the United States the award could be made to an alien.</p>
<p class="note-body">The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., &sect;&sect;192&ndash;196, has long needed revision. The existing law is composed of a series of statutes enacted separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result has not been entirely unsatisfactory. The original statute, enacted in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;193), provided <!-- PDFPage:77 -->for Life-saving medals of the first and second class to be bestowed &ldquo;upon any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel&rdquo;. The medal of the first class was confined to cases of &ldquo;extreme and heroic daring&rdquo; and the medal of the second class was to be awarded &ldquo;in cases not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class&rdquo; Then in 1878 another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second class &ldquo;upon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked, and saving persons from drowning&rdquo; as, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition. These two sections were construed by the Attorney General to be limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to the perils of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of any lifeboat station, life-saving station, or house of refuge. And the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to members of life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att. Gen. 124. Thereupon, in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the two earlier acts should &ldquo;be construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to bestow such medals upon persons making signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, whether the said persons making such exertions were or were not members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions were made in the vicinity of a life-saving station&rdquo;. (Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;196.) This act was designed to give a more liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 78. However, difficult questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different jurisdictional language in the three acts. For example, title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;193, refers to rescues &ldquo;within the United States&rdquo;, while title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;196, refers to rescues &ldquo;in the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction&rdquo;. The need for clarification is obvious. Subsection (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person, including Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any person from drowning, shipwreck, or peril of the water. If the rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold, and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded are defined simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional limitations. The difficulty with the existing law is the attempt to define the required deed together with those limitations. Subsection (a) does not change existing law insofar as the type of act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and clarifies existing law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the awarding of the medal and broadens, to a considerable extent, the provisions of existing law. It is the intent of this subsection to authorize the awarding of a medal in all cases where the United States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts, such as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a United States citizen is rescued, or where United States waters or United States vessels or aircraft are involved. Accordingly, rescues by United States citizens anywhere in the world will be recognized. Any person, including persons not citizens of the United States, may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place in waters within the United States or subject to its jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either the rescuer or the person rescued is from a United States vessel or aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen. Thus, every case in which the United States government has an interest is provided for. A United States citizen who performs a heroic act sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign waters, could not receive one under existing law, but could receive such award under this proposed revision. The awarding of medals should not turn on technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble and heroic acts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;195, except that authority is granted to award medals posthumously. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Commandant may make child development services available for members and civilian employees of the Coast Guard, and thereafter as space is available for members of the Armed Forces and Federal civilian employees. Child development service benefits provided under the authority of this section shall be in addition to benefits provided under other laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Commandant may require that amounts received as fees for the provision of services under this section at Coast Guard child development centers be used only for compensation of employees at those centers who are directly involved in providing child care.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commandant determines that compliance with the limitation in paragraph (1) would result in an uneconomical and inefficient use of such fee receipts, the Commandant may (to the extent that such compliance would be uneconomical and inefficient) use such receipts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the purchase of consumable or disposable items for Coast Guard child development centers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the requirements of such centers for consumable or disposable items for a given fiscal year have been met, for other expenses of those centers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commandant shall provide for regular and unannounced inspections of each child development center under this section and may use Department of Defense or other training programs to ensure that all child development center employees under this section meet minimum standards of training with respect to early childhood development, activities and disciplinary techniques appropriate to children of different ages, child abuse prevention and detection, and appropriate emergency medical procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Of the amounts available to the Coast Guard each fiscal year for operating expenses (and in addition to amounts received as fees), the Secretary may use for child development services under this section an amount not to ex<!-- PDFPage:81 -->ceed the total amount the Commandant estimates will be received by the Coast Guard in the fiscal year as fees for the provision of those services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commandant may use appropriated funds available to the Coast Guard to provide assistance to family home day care providers so that family home day care services can be provided to uniformed service members and civilian employees of the Coast Guard at a cost comparable to the cost of services provided by Coast Guard child development centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. The regulations shall establish fees to be charged for child development services provided under this section which take into consideration total family income.</p>
