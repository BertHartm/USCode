<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The authorized number of officers in the Reserve in an active status is 5,000. The actual number of Reserve officers in an active status at any time shall not exceed the authorized number unless the Secretary determines that a greater number is necessary for planned mobilization requirements, or unless the excess results directly from the operation of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The authorized number of Reserve officers in an active status below the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be distributed in grade in the following percentages, respectively: captain, 1.5; commander, 7.0; lieutenant commander, 22.0; lieutenant, 37.0; and the combined grades of lieutenant (junior grade) and ensign, 32.5. When the actual number of Reserve officers in an active status in a grade is less than the number authorized, the difference may be applied to increase the authorized number in a lower grade. A Reserve officer may not be reduced in rank or grade solely because of a reduction in an authorized number as provided for in this subsection, or because an excess results directly from the operation of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authorized number of Reserve Officers in an active status not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral is a total of two. However, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may authorize an additional number of Reserve officers not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral as necessary in order to meet planned mobilization requirements.</p>
