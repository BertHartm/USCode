<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Coast Guard may, when so requested by proper authority, utilize its personnel and facilities (including members of the Auxiliary and facilities governed under chapter 23) to assist any Federal agency, State, Territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, to perform any activity for which such personnel and facilities are especially qualified. The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including reimbursement, under which personnel and facilities may be provided under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Coast Guard, with the consent of the head of the agency concerned, may avail itself of such officers and employees, advice, information, and facilities of any Federal agency, State, Territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia as may be helpful in the performance of its duties. In connection with the utilization of personal services of employees of state or local governments, the Coast Guard may make payments for necessary traveling and per diem expenses as prescribed for Federal employees by the standardized Government travel regulations.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;756 (Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 81, &sect;6, 38 Stat. 928), and authorizes the Coast Guard to use its personnel and facilities to assist other Government agencies when requested and, correlatively, authorizes the Coast Guard to utilize the personnel and facilities of other agencies. It is believed desirable to have this authority spelled out by statute because in times of emergency, for example floods, it sometimes becomes most advantageous to cooperate in this manner. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
