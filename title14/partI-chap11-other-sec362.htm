<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;3501(e) (July 24, 1941, ch. 320, &sect;10, 55 Stat. 605; Feb. 21, 1946, ch. 34, &sect;8(a), 60 Stat. 28).</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the higher grade or rating be held prior to June 30, 1946, has been eliminated; this seems to be in line with the intent of Congress as expressed in section 303 of the act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1081. The act of July 24, 1941, 55 Stat. 605, was enacted primarily for application to Navy personnel but it is made applicable to Coast Guard personnel by its own terms (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;350j(b)). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
