<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Commandant may make child development services available for members and civilian employees of the Coast Guard, and thereafter as space is available for members of the Armed Forces and Federal civilian employees. Child development service benefits provided under the authority of this section shall be in addition to benefits provided under other laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Commandant may require that amounts received as fees for the provision of services under this section at Coast Guard child development centers be used only for compensation of employees at those centers who are directly involved in providing child care.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commandant determines that compliance with the limitation in paragraph (1) would result in an uneconomical and inefficient use of such fee receipts, the Commandant may (to the extent that such compliance would be uneconomical and inefficient) use such receipts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the purchase of consumable or disposable items for Coast Guard child development centers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the requirements of such centers for consumable or disposable items for a given fiscal year have been met, for other expenses of those centers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commandant shall provide for regular and unannounced inspections of each child development center under this section and may use Department of Defense or other training programs to ensure that all child development center employees under this section meet minimum standards of training with respect to early childhood development, activities and disciplinary techniques appropriate to children of different ages, child abuse prevention and detection, and appropriate emergency medical procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Of the amounts available to the Coast Guard each fiscal year for operating expenses (and in addition to amounts received as fees), the Secretary may use for child development services under this section an amount not to ex<!-- PDFPage:81 -->ceed the total amount the Commandant estimates will be received by the Coast Guard in the fiscal year as fees for the provision of those services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commandant may use appropriated funds available to the Coast Guard to provide assistance to family home day care providers so that family home day care services can be provided to uniformed service members and civilian employees of the Coast Guard at a cost comparable to the cost of services provided by Coast Guard child development centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. The regulations shall establish fees to be charged for child development services provided under this section which take into consideration total family income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;child development center&rdquo; does not include a child care services facility for which space is allotted under section 616 of the Act of December 22, 1987 (40 U.S.C. 490b).</p>
