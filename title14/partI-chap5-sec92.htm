<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section grants broad general powers concerning policy matters to the Secretary. Many of the powers are contained in existing law but some are enlarged and some additional powers are added as explained following.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;95 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Said section has been divided. The provision authorizing the Secretary to man stations seems more appropriately given to the operational head of the Service, the Commandant, and for that reason is incorporated in section 93(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;28, 42 (Aug. 16, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, &sect;11, 44 Stat. 817). These sections were rewritten in order to broaden existing authority in regard to the training of Coast Guard personnel at schools of the other armed forces, thus approaching a practice of war time, and making for economy in the training of Service personnel; such training would be on a basis mutually satisfactory to the Secretaries involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is based on R.S. 4242 and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;29, 93, 94, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, &sect;2, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, &sect;4, 54 Stat. 247; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the construction and disposal of shore establishments of all types including aviation stations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;55, 57, 69, 109, and in part on title 31, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;487, 720, (R.S. 2748, 3618, 3692; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;3, 20 Stat. 163; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the design, construction, acquisition by other means, and disposal of vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is new. It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, &sect;602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, &sect;6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]) which provides for the exchange of vehicles, planes, and engines; similar authority in relation to vessels, is granted to the Secretary by this subsection and should prove advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;96 and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;729, 730, 731 (Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 130, &sect;1, 18 Stat. 372; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 299, 35 Stat. 972; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, &sect;9, 36 Stat. 538; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018). This subsection broadens the power of the Secretary to receive as a gift or purchase sites for stations, to include the acquisition of land by any means provided it is for the purpose of executing duties and functions of the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;732 (Aug. 28, 1916, ch. 414, &sect;2, 39 Stat. 538; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, &sect;1, 55 Stat. 584) and grants authority to the Secretary to exchange interests in land as payment or part payment for other interests in land for the purpose of executing the duties and functions of the Coast Guard; this authority, on the basis of past experience, will prove advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (h) is new and merely insures that the Secretary may exercise any of the powers granted to the Commandant in this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;51, 131 (R.S. 2756, 2758) and insures that the Secretary may do anything necessary to carry out the purposes of this title.</p>
