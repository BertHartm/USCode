<p class="note-body">This section does not change the present method of administration of the Academy. It makes statutory what has been administrative regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make the control of an institution of such national interest as the Academy the subject of a statute.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section is new. There is no provision in existing law which establishes the Academy and sets it up as an operating unit. Nor is there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of the Academy, or prescribes his duties and functions. Heretofore this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which deal with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and assume the existence of the Superintendent with certain defined functions and duties. This section continues the Academy as previously established, provides for the appointment of the Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general terms his functions. The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory basis, and the office of Superintendent would be a statutory position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no way be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;182. Cadets; number, appointment, obligation to serve</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The number of cadets appointed annually to the Academy shall be as determined by the Secretary but the number appointed in any one year shall not exceed six hundred. Appointments to cadetships shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, who shall determine age limits, methods of selection of applicants, term of service as a cadet before graduation, and all other matters affecting such appointments. All such appointments shall be made without regard to the sex, race, color, or religious beliefs of an applicant. In the administration of this chapter, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary and appropriate to insure that female individuals shall be eligible for appointment and admission to the Coast Guard Academy, and that the relevant standards required for appointment, admission, training, graduation, and commissioning of female individuals shall be the same as those required for male individuals, except for those minimum essential adjustments in such standards required because of physiological differences between male and female individuals. The Secretary may summarily dismiss from the Coast Guard any cadet who, during his cadetship, is found unsatisfactory in either studies or conduct, or may be deemed not adapted for a career in the Coast Guard. Cadets shall be subject to rules governing discipline prescribed by the Commandant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each cadet shall sign an agreement with respect to the cadet's length of service in the Coast Guard. The agreement shall provide that the cadet agrees to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That the cadet will complete the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy the cadet&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) will accept an appointment, if tendered, as a commissioned officer of the Coast Guard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will serve on active duty for at least five years immediately after such appointment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That if an appointment described in paragraph (2) is not tendered or if the cadet is permitted to resign as a regular officer before the completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet, the cadet&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) will accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will remain in that reserve component until completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary may transfer to the Coast Guard Reserve, and may order to active duty for such period of time as the Secretary prescribes (but not to exceed four years), a cadet who breaches an agreement under subsection (b). The period of time for which a cadet is ordered to active duty under this paragraph may be determined without regard to section 651(a) of title 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cadet who is transferred to the Coast Guard Reserve under paragraph (1) shall be transferred in an appropriate enlisted grade or rating, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a cadet shall be considered to have breached an agreement under subsection (b) if the cadet is separated from the Coast Guard Academy under circumstances which the Secretary determines constitute a breach by the cadet of the cadet's agreement to complete the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy and accept an appointment as a commissioned officer upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Those regulations shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) standards for determining what constitutes, for the purpose of subsection (c), a breach of an agreement under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procedures for determining whether such a breach has occurred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) standards for determining the period of time for which a person may be ordered to serve on active duty under subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In this section, &ldquo;commissioned service obligation&rdquo;, with respect to an officer who is a graduate of the Academy, means the period beginning on the date of the officer's appointment as a commissioned officer and ending on the sixth anniversary of such appointment or, at the discretion of the Secretary, any later date up to the eighth anniversary of such appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) This section does not apply to a cadet who is not a citizen or national of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a cadet who is a minor and who has parents or a guardian, the cadet may sign the agreement required by subsection (b) only with the consent of the parent or guardian.</p>

The work load of an instructor varies greatly, and flexibility in administration of a faculty is therefore essential. The leave provided for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an instruction staff, and this has been a source of difficulty in the past. This new provision would permit leave during the summer and between academic terms without deduction from pay, and, it is contemplated, at no other time.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 15c of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The last sentence is incorporated in this section, while the other provisions are placed in section 189 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The composition of the teaching staff at the Academy is changed materially on the recommendation of the Academic Board and the Advisory Committee. The scope of duty of members of the staff is enlarged to include whatever the Commandant prescribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;15b provides for five professors as heads or assistant heads of departments at the Academy. The Academic Board of the Academy and the Advisory Committee, after extensive study have recommended the change, as provided in this section, to three professors and twelve others on the permanent teaching staff, with designations to conform generally with the designations and grades of faculty members at other universities. The librarian is given faculty status because of the role of the library as the center of the modern university; this is in conformity with the practice of other higher educational institutions. It is believed that the increased number of permanent commissioned instructors is justified and desirable in view of the expansion of the Cadet Corps as the full effect of the return to a four-year course is felt. It is probable that, in the next few years, the number of cadets will approximate 450. The average number in the past two years has been about 300. This new set-up for the permanent commissioned teaching staff will permit desirable exchanges of professors with leading universities, and occasional sabbatical leaves in order to better the faculty generally. It is pointed out that this increase in permanent instructors does not increase the authorized number of officers in the Coast Guard, as they are all included in the limitation provided in section 42 of this title. If a teaching position at the Academy is not provided for permanently it will require the assignment of an additional regular officer, so it is apparent that the changes proposed in this section do not increase the size of the Service, or the expense, but represent a long-range plan to better the Academy as a leading edu<!-- PDFPage:32 -->cational institution within the present, recognized, standards for a proper university faculty. The last sentence retains the command status of the professors as provided in existing law but enlarges the field in which they may perform duty, in order to make it possible to give them interim assignments other than at the Academy, thus broadening their knowledge of the Service while still advantageously utilizing their services. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;15g (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, &sect;6, 50 Stat. 67).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section dealing with the Advisory Committee is changed to increase the number of persons thereon to 7, the source from which appointments could be made is broadened to include other than educators, the term of appointment is fixed as 3 years, and provision is made for the appointment of the chairman by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section changes existing law as follows: the field from which appointment may be made is broadened, the limit of membership is increased from five to seven, a provision for appointment of a chairman by the Secretary is added, and the term of service is established as three years. It is believed that the membership of not to exceed seven will provide greater flexibility in view of the new three year term of service, and will permit appointment of a committee with wider interests. The fact that no term of service has been provided for heretofore has been a source of confusion and difficulty and some term should be specified. The existing law provides for appointment from the field of education; <!-- PDFPage:34 -->this is enlarged to include other fields relating to purposes of the Academy, in order, primarily, to permit selection from shipping, business, and industry. No provision has been made for selection of a chairman heretofore, and this has caused some uncertainty in the functioning of the Committee; annual appointment seems desirable.</p>
