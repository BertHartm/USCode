<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for the Coast Guard to deal with foreign governments, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard and the State Department agree that a provision such as this is desirable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes it more and more necessary for the Service to be an initiating or participating agency in international collaboration. Examples of international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international telecommunications. It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road, safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels. Provisions for similar relationship between the Civil Aeronautical Board and the State Department appear in the act of June 23, 1938, as amended, 52 Stat. 984 (title 49, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;425(c), 602). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
