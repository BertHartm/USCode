<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may appoint an Advisory Committee to the Academy, consisting of not more than seven persons of distinction in education and other fields relating to the purposes of the Academy, who shall serve without pay (or, in the case of a member of the Committee who is an officer or employee of the United States, who shall receive no additional pay on account of his service on the Committee). Members of the Advisory Committee shall be appointed for terms of not to exceed three years and may be reappointed. The Secretary shall, in June of each year, appoint one of the members to serve as chairman. The members so appointed shall visit the Academy at least once during the academic year on the call of the chairman and may convene once each year at Headquarters, at the call of the Commandant, for the purpose of examining the course of instruction and advising the Commandant relative thereto. Each member of the Committee shall be reimbursed from Coast Guard appropriations in conformity with the provisions of chapter 57 of title 5. The Secretary shall, not less often than once a year, publish notice in the Federal Register for solicitation of nominations for membership on the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee is authorized to make available to Congress any information, advice, and recommendations which the Advisory Committee is authorized to give to the Secretary or the Commandant. The Committee terminates on September 30, 1994.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;15g (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, &sect;6, 50 Stat. 67).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section dealing with the Advisory Committee is changed to increase the number of persons thereon to 7, the source from which appointments could be made is broadened to include other than educators, the term of appointment is fixed as 3 years, and provision is made for the appointment of the chairman by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section changes existing law as follows: the field from which appointment may be made is broadened, the limit of membership is increased from five to seven, a provision for appointment of a chairman by the Secretary is added, and the term of service is established as three years. It is believed that the membership of not to exceed seven will provide greater flexibility in view of the new three year term of service, and will permit appointment of a committee with wider interests. The fact that no term of service has been provided for heretofore has been a source of confusion and difficulty and some term should be specified. The existing law provides for appointment from the field of education; this is enlarged to include other fields relating to purposes of the Academy, in order, primarily, to permit selection from shipping, business, and industry. No provision has been made for selection of a chairman heretofore, and this has caused some uncertainty in the functioning of the Committee; annual appointment seems desirable.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
