<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;3501(a) and (b), 350j(b) (July 24, 1941, ch. 320, &sect;10, 55 Stat. 605; Feb. 21, 1946, ch. 34, &sect;8(a), 60 Stat. 28).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said sections have application to officers only, but in accord with the general plan to make as many provisions as possible applicable both to officers and men, it seems highly desirable to provide similarly for enlisted men&mdash;a fortiori because there are cases in the Coast Guard in which enlisted men are suffering inequitably because there is no provision for advancing men on the retired list after they have been advanced in rating while serving on active duty after recall from the retired list. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
