<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;441a (May 19, 1926, ch. 334, 44 Stat. 565; May 14, 1935, ch. 109, 49 Stat. 218; Oct. 1, 1942, ch. 571, 56 Stat. 763; 1946 Proc. No. 2695, July 4, 1946, 11 F.R. 7517, 60 Stat. 1352).</p>
<p class="note-body">Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the Government to include the Coast Guard along <!-- PDFPage:36 -->with the other armed forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with foreign governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign governments after the war and the vital nature of the Coast Guard's activities in relation to such collaboration will result in requests from time to time by foreign governments for assistance which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render. This section, which confers broad authority in the President to detail Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 763 (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;441&ndash;a), which authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers and men to certain foreign governments and, in times of war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the interests of national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
