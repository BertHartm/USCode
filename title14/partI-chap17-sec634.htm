<h4 class="note-head">1949 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;48 (June 22, 1936, ch. 705, &sect;4, 49 Stat. 1821; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, &sect;7, 55 Stat. 585).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is derived from the last 6 lines of title 48, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;1460 (July 31, 1939, ch. 399, 53 Stat. 1143). An additional provision is added waiving the requirement of a performance bond inasmuch as Coast Guard officers appointed as United States commissioners or marshals are not custodians of funds, and in any case their oath as a commissioned officer appears to be sufficient to insure faithful performance of duty.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
