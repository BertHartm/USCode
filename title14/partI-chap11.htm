<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This chapter, dealing with the appointment, enlistment, promotion, retirement and recall of all military personnel, covers subject matter which has been greatly affected by war-time legislation and, therefore, has required rather extensive rewriting of existing law in order to correlate all of the various provisions. An attempt has been made to provide for enlisted men and warrant officers in a manner similar to the way that commissioned officers are provided for; for example, the act of February 21, 1946, ch. 34, 60 Stat. 29 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;162a), made provision for the retirement of commissioned officers on half pay after twenty years naval service, and a prewar statute provided for twenty year retirement of enlisted men on half pay. This leaves warrant officers the only military group not eligible for retirement in twenty years, and a provision such as found in section 305 of this title, granting such retirement, seems clearly indicated in order to avoid unjust discrimination.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subject matter seemed to break down into the sub-heads of &ldquo;Commissioned Officers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Warrant Officers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Enlisted Men&rdquo;, and &ldquo;General Provisions&rdquo;. Each of the first three sub-heads parallels the other two, insofar as the applicability of statutes of the three groups permits. The last sub-head includes the broad provisions which, in the same terms, can be made applicable to all military personnel. In accord with existing Navy and Coast Guard law, the term &ldquo;commissioned officer&rdquo; includes commissioned warrant officers unless specifically excepted, or manifestly inapplicable. Heretofore Coast Guard statutes have designated commissioned warrant officers as chief warrant officers; in line with Navy designation it is changed to commissioned warrant officers throughout this title. Terms such as &ldquo;Coast Guard personnel&rdquo; or &ldquo;personnel of the Coast Guard&rdquo;, as used throughout this title, are intended to include all employees of the Service, civilian and military. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 35 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The provisions of the first sentence of subsection (a) are placed in this section. The proviso of subsection (a) is covered in section 367(b) of this title. Subsection (b) is placed in section 365 of this title. Subsections (c) and (d) are placed in section 367(a) of this title, except that part (3) of subsection (c) is covered by section 366 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 206 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. That part dealing with special temporary enlistments is incorporated in this section. That part dealing with temporary appointments of warrant officers is placed in section 302 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Certain additional details concerning the two types of enlistments are added; these details were previously covered in Coast Guard Regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section makes provision for the enlistment of personnel in the Coast Guard. The first sentence grants the necessary authority to the Secretary, changes existing law in regard to the term of enlistment from &ldquo;not to exceed four years&rdquo; to &ldquo;not to exceed six years&rdquo;, and adds a provision for the enlistment of minors for their minority only, such provision being in accordance with existing law applicable to the Navy. The next three sentences establish and define the two types of enlistments that are now in effect in the Coast Guard, setting forth the basic difference in the two types. The last sentence continues a provision to the effect that original enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be temporary. This section is a combination of existing law and regulations in regard to enlistments, with changes as noted above.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any person of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned as an officer in the Coast Guard shall be an extra number in his grade and in the grades to which he may be promoted. He shall take precedence (1) with other officers commissioned in his grade from the former Lighthouse Service as the Secretary of the Treasury may determine, and (2) with other line officers in his grade in accordance with the respective dates of their commissions in such grade. He shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, at such time as the officer in a regular number in line of promotion next above him on the seniority list becomes eligible for promotion; or if there be no such officer in his grade, he shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, when a vacancy occurs in the next higher grade. An officer so commissioned shall be assigned to duty for which he is specially qualified, and professional examinations for promotion given to such officer shall embrace only subjects which pertain to the duty to which he is assigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each vacancy (1) hereafter occurring in the extra numbers of such officers; (2) existing on August 5, 1939, in positions in the Lighthouse Service formerly held by personnel eligible for such commissions; and (3) created by the retirement, resignation, death, or separation from the service for any other cause, of such personnel who do not possess the qualifications prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or who, being qualified, do not accept a commission thereunder, shall operate to increase by one the total authorized number of line officers of the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) All persons of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall be subject to all laws and regulations for the government of the Coast Guard, and nothing contained in this title shall be construed to prevent the application to any of such persons of laws and regulations concerning the military discipline of commissioned and warrant <!-- PDFPage:66 -->officers and enlisted members of the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In computing length of service, for the purpose of retirement in the Coast Guard, of any person of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard, there shall be included all service computable for retirement under the provisions of section 763 of title 33; and after July 1, 1948, in computing longevity for the purpose of pay of such person there shall be included all service of such person in the Lighthouse Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No person so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall suffer any reduction in the total of the annual compensation and allowances which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment. Upon his retirement from active duty in the Coast Guard, the retired pay of any person so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted, shall not be less than an annuity computed in accordance with the provisions of section 763 of title 33, substituting, however, for purposes of such computation, the annual compensation which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment in the Coast Guard for the average annual pay received by him for the last five years of service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, chapter 51, subchapter III of chapter 53, and sections 5542&ndash;5546 of title 5 shall not apply to civilian keepers of lighthouses and to civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The head of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating under regulations prescribed by him, may regulate the hours of duty and the pay of civilian keepers of lighthouses and civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard, but such personnel may be called upon for duty in emergency circumstances or otherwise at any time or all times. The existing system governing the pay of such employees may be continued or changed except that overtime compensation, night differential, and extra pay for duty on holidays shall not be paid to such employees. In lieu thereof additional annual compensation may be authorized, which may be prescribed either as a fixed differential or as a percentage of the basic compensation otherwise applicable to such employees. In no case shall basic compensation exceed $15,000 per annum, except that nothing contained in this subsection shall operate to decrease the basic compensation of any person employed by the Coast Guard on the date of enactment of this subsection, and in no case shall additions thereto exceed 25 percent of such basic compensation. Provision may be made for compensatory absence from duty when conditions of employment result in confinement because of isolation or in long periods of continuous duty; and provisions may likewise be made for extra allowance for service outside of the continental limits of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The additional compensation authorized by this subsection shall be included in any computation of compensation under section 6 of the Act of June 20, 1918 (33 U.S.C. 763).</p>
