<h3 class="section-head">&sect;475. Leasing and hiring of quarters; rental of inadequate housing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to lease housing facilities at or near Coast Guard installa<!-- PDFPage:66 -->tions, wherever located, for assignment as public quarters to military personnel and their dependents, if any, without rental charge upon a determination by the Secretary, or his designee, that there is a lack of adequate housing facilities at or near such Coast Guard installations. The Secretary is also authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public quarters, without rental charge, to military personnel who are on sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do not have dependents. Such authority shall be effective in any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. When any such lease involves housing facilities in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five years, and, in accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be made for the lease. Such public housing facilities may be leased on an individual or multiple-unit basis. Expenditures for the rental of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense in any year except where the Secretary finds that the average is so low as to prevent rental of necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is authorized to reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that rental expenditures in such areas exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved by the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to designate as rental housing such housing as he may determine to be inadequate as public quarters; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to lease inadequate housing to members of the Coast Guard for occupancy by them and their dependents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Where sufficient quarters are not possessed by the United States, the Commandant may hire quarters for personnel, including personnel on sea duty at such times as they may be deprived of their quarters on board ship due to repairs or other conditions which may render them uninhabitable. Such accommodations shall not be available for occupancy by the dependents of such personnel.</p>
