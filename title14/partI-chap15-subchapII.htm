<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Update</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Chief Acquisition Officer must approve an updated master plan whenever there is a revision to project or program test and evaluation strategy, scope, or phasing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Coast Guard may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) proceed beyond that phase of the acquisition process that entails approving the supporting acquisition of a capability or asset before the master plan is approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) award any production contract for a capability, asset, or subsystem for which a master plan is required under this subsection before the master plan is approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Life-Cycle Cost Estimates.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commandant shall implement mechanisms to ensure the development and regular updating of life-cycle cost estimates for each acquisition with a total acquisition cost that equals or exceeds $10,000,000 and an expected service life of 10 or more years, and to ensure that these estimates are considered in decisions to develop or produce new or enhanced capabilities and assets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Types of estimates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to life-cycle cost estimates that may be developed by acquisition program offices, the Commandant shall require that an independent life-cycle cost estimate be developed for each Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Required updates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For each Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program the Commandant shall require that life-cycle cost estimates shall be updated before each milestone decision is concluded and the project or program enters a new acquisition phase.</p>
