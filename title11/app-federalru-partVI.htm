<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Custodian&rdquo; is defined in &sect;101(10) of the Code. The definition includes a trustee or receiver appointed in <!-- PDFPage:90 -->proceedings not under the Code, as well as an assignee for the benefit of creditors.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed by a custodian who under &sect;543 of the Code is required to deliver property to the trustee and to account for its disposition. The examination under subdivision (b) may be initiated (1) on the motion of the custodian required to account under subdivision (a) for an approval of his account and discharge thereon, (2) on the motion of, or the filing of an objection to the custodian's account by, the trustee or any other party in interest, or (3) on the court's own initiative. Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 543(d) is similar to an abstention provision. It grants the bankruptcy court discretion to permit the custodian to remain in possession and control of the property. In that event, the custodian is excused from complying with &sect;543(a)&ndash;(c) and thus would not be required to turn over the property to the trustee. When there is no duty to turn over to the trustee, Rule 6002 would not be applicable.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule [Former Rule 6003&mdash;Disbursement of Money of the Estate (Abrogated Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991)] is abrogated in view of the role of the United States trustee in supervising trustees. Use of estate funds by a trustee or debtor in possession is governed by &sect;363 of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007</h4>
<p class="note-body">There can be a flurry of activity during the first days of a bankruptcy case. This activity frequently takes place prior to the formation of a creditors&rsquo; committee, and it also can include substantial amounts of materials for the court and parties in interest to review and evaluate. This rule is intended to alleviate some of the time pressures present at the start of a case so that full and close consideration can be given to matters that may have a fundamental impact on the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule provides that the court cannot grant relief on applications for the employment of professional persons, motions for the use, sale, or lease of property of the estate other than such a motion under Rule 4001, and motions to assume or assign executory contracts and unexpired leases for the first 20 days of the case, unless granting relief is necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm. This standard is taken from Rule 4001(b)(2) and (c)(2), and decisions under those provisions should provide guidance for the application of this provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule does not govern motions and applications made more than 20 days after the filing of the petition.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes After Publication</em>. Subdivision (c) was amended by deleting the reference to the rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases. The rule, as revised, now limits only the assumption or assignment of executory contracts or unexpired leases in that subdivision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Proposed Use, Sale, or Lease of Property</cap-smallcap>. Notice of a proposed use, sale, or lease of property, other than cash collateral, not in the ordinary course of business shall be given pursuant to Rule 2002(a)(2), (c)(1), (i), and (k) and, if applicable, in accordance with &sect;363(b)(2) of the Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Objection to Proposal</cap-smallcap>. Except as provided in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this rule, an objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property shall be filed and served not less than seven days before the date set for the proposed action or within the time fixed by the court. An objection to the proposed use, sale, or lease of property is governed by Rule 9014.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Sale Free and Clear of Liens and Other Interests</cap-smallcap>. A motion for authority to sell property free and clear of liens or other interests shall be made in accordance with Rule 9014 and shall be served on the parties who have liens or other interests in the property to be sold. The notice required by subdivision (a) of this rule shall include the date of the hearing on the motion and the time within which objections may be filed and served on the debtor in possession or trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Sale of Property Under </cap-smallcap>$2,500. Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of this rule, when all of the nonexempt property of the estate has an aggregate gross value less than $2,500, it shall be sufficient to give a general notice of intent to sell such property other than in the ordinary course of business to all creditors, indenture trustees, committees appointed or elected pursuant to the Code, the United States trustee and other persons as the court may direct. An objection to any such sale may be filed and served by a party in interest within 14 days of the mailing of the notice, or within the time fixed by the court. An objection is governed by Rule 9014.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Hearing</cap-smallcap>. If a timely objection is made pursuant to subdivision (b) or (d) of this rule, the <!-- PDFPage:91 -->date of the hearing thereon may be set in the notice given pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Conduct of Sale Not in the Ordinary Course of Business</cap-smallcap>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Public or Private Sale</em>. All sales not in the ordinary course of business may be by private sale or by public auction. Unless it is impracticable, an itemized statement of the property sold, the name of each purchaser, and the price received for each item or lot or for the property as a whole if sold in bulk shall be filed on completion of a sale. If the property is sold by an auctioneer, the auctioneer shall file the statement, transmit a copy thereof to the United States trustee, and furnish a copy to the trustee, debtor in possession, or chapter 13 debtor. If the property is not sold by an auctioneer, the trustee, debtor in possession, or chapter 13 debtor shall file the statement and transmit a copy thereof to the United States trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Execution of Instruments</em>. After a sale in accordance with this rule the debtor, the trustee, or debtor in possession, as the case may be, shall execute any instrument necessary or ordered by the court to effectuate the transfer to the purchaser.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Sale of Personally Identifiable Information.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Motion</em>. A motion for authority to sell or lease personally identifiable information under &sect;363(b)(1)(B) shall include a request for an order directing the United States trustee to appoint a consumer privacy ombudsman under &sect;332. Rule 9014 governs the motion which shall be served on: any committee elected under &sect;705 or appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code, or if the case is a chapter 11 reorganization case and no committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under &sect;1102, on the creditors included on the list of creditors filed under Rule 1007(d); and on such other entities as the court may direct. The motion shall be transmitted to the United States trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Appointment</em>. If a consumer privacy ombudsman is appointed under &sect;332, no later than seven days before the hearing on the motion under &sect;363(b)(1)(B), the United States trustee shall file a notice of the appointment, including the name and address of the person appointed. The United States trustee's notice shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person appointed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Stay of Order Authorizing Use, Sale, or Lease of Property</cap-smallcap>. An order authorizing the use, sale, or lease of property other than cash collateral is stayed until the expiration of 14 days after entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em>. Pursuant to &sect;363(b) of the Code, a trustee or debtor in possession may use, sell, or lease property other than in the ordinary course of business only after notice and hearing. Rule 2002(a), (c) and (i) specifies the time when notice of sale is to be given, the contents of the notice and the persons to whom notice is to be given of sales of property. Subdivision (a) makes those provisions applicable as well to notices for proposed use and lease of property.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Code does not provide the time within which parties may file objections to a proposed sale. Subdivision (b) of the rule requires the objection to be in writing and filed not less than five days before the proposed action is to take place. The objection should also be served within that time on the person who is proposing to take the action which would be either the trustee or debtor in possession. This time period is subject to change by the court. In some instances there is a need to conduct a sale in a short period of time and the court is given discretion to tailor the requirements to the circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. In some situations a notice of sale for different pieces of property to all persons specified in Rule 2002(a) may be uneconomic and inefficient. This is particularly true in some chapter 7 liquidation cases when there is property of relatively little value which must be sold by the trustee. Subdivision (c) allows a general notice of intent to sell when the aggregate value of the estate's property is less than $2,500. The gross value is the value of the property without regard to the amount of any debt secured by a lien on the property. It is not necessary to give a detailed notice specifying the time and place of a particular sale. Thus, the requirements of Rule 2002(c) need not be met. If this method of providing notice of sales is used, the subdivision specifies that parties in interest may serve and file objections to the proposed sale of any property within the class and the time for service and filing is fixed at not later than 15 days after mailing the notice. The court may fix a different time. Subdivision (c) would have little utility in chapter 11 cases. Pursuant to Rule 2002(i), the court can limit notices of sale to the creditors&rsquo; committee appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code and the same burdens present in a small chapter 7 case would not exist.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. If a timely objection is filed, a hearing is required with respect to the use, sale, or lease of property. Subdivision (d) renders the filing of an objection tantamount to requesting a hearing so as to require a hearing pursuant to &sect;&sect;363(b) and 102(l)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is derived in part from former Bankruptcy Rule 606(b) but does not carry forward the requirement of that rule that court approval be obtained for sales of property. Pursuant to &sect;363(b) court approval is not required unless timely objection is made to the proposed sale. The itemized statement or information required by the subdivision is not necessary when it would be impracticable to prepare it or set forth the information. For example, a liquidation sale of retail goods although not in the ordinary course of business may be on a daily ongoing basis and only summaries may be available.</p>
<p class="note-body">The duty imposed by paragraph (2) does not affect the power of the bankruptcy court to order third persons to execute instruments transferring property purchased at a sale under this subdivision. See, <em>e.g., In re Rosenberg</em>, 138 F.2d 409 (7th Cir. 1943).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to &sect;363(b)(2) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to provide that an objection to a proposed use, sale, or lease of property creates a contested matter governed by Rule 9014. A similar amendment is made to subdivision (d), which was formerly subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is new. Section 363(f) provides that sales free and clear of liens or other interests are only <!-- PDFPage:92 -->permitted if one of the five statutory requirements is satisfied. Rule 9013 requires that a motion state with particularity the grounds relied upon by the movant. A motion for approval of a sale free and clear of liens or other interests is subject to Rule 9014, service must be made on the parties holding liens or other interests in the property, and notice of the hearing on the motion and the time for filing objections must be included in the notice given under subdivision (a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to provide notice to the United States trustee of a proposed use, sale or lease of property not in the ordinary course of business. See Rule 2002(k). Subdivision (f)(1) is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(G).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;with the clerk&rdquo; in subdivision (f)(1) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order authorizing the use, sale, or lease of property under &sect;363(b) of the Code before the order is implemented. It does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 6004(g) does not apply to orders regarding the use of cash collateral and does not affect the trustee's right to use, sell, or lease property without a court order to the extent permitted under &sect;363 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 6004(g) is not applicable so that the property may be used, sold, or leased immediately in accordance with the order entered by the court. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule 6004(g) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 6004</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended by inserting a new subdivision (g) to implement &sect;&sect;332 and 363(b)(1)(B) of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments. This rule governs the proposed transfer of personally identifiable information in a manner inconsistent with any policy covering the transfer of the information. Rule 2002(c)(1) requires the seller to state in the notice of the sale or lease whether the transfer is consistent with and policy governing the transfer of the information.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under &sect;332 of the Code, the consumer privacy ombudsman must be appointed at least five days prior to the hearing on a sale or lease of personally identifiable information. In an appropriate case, the consumer privacy ombudsman may seek a continuance of the hearing on the proposed sale to perform the tasks required of the ombudsman by &sect;332 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (g) is redesignated as subdivision (h).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. The Committee Note was amended to highlight the connection between this rule and Rule 2002 with regard to the obligation to provide notice of proposed transactions. It was also amended to recognize the ability of the consumer privacy ombudsman to seek a continuance of a hearing on the proposed sale of personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 606(c) and implements &sect;327 of the Code. Pursuant to &sect;327, the trustee or debtor in possession may employ one or more appraisers or auctioneers, subject to court approval. This rule requires the court order approving such employment to fix the amount or rate of compensation. The second sentence of the former rule is retained to continue to safeguard against imputations of favoritism which detract from public confidence in bankruptcy administration. The final sentence is to guard against imposition of parochial requirements not warranted by any consideration having to do with sound bankruptcy administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference should also be made to Rule 2013(a) regarding the limitation on employment of appraisers and auctioneers, and Rule 2014(a) regarding the application for appointment of an appraiser or auctioneer.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 365(a) of the Code requires court approval for the assumption or rejection of an executory contract by the trustee or debtor in possession. The trustee or debtor in possession may also assign an executory contract, &sect;365(f)(1), but must first assume the contract, &sect;365(f)(2). Rule 6006 provides a procedure for obtaining court approval. It does not apply to the automatic rejection of contracts which are not assumed in chapter 7 liquidation cases within 60 days after the order for relief, or to the assumption or rejection of contracts in a plan pursuant to &sect;1123(b)(2) or &sect;1322(b)(7).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> by referring to Rule 9014 requires a motion to be brought for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an executory contract. Normally, the motion will be brought by the trustee, debtor in possession or debtor in a chapter 9 or chapter 13 case. The authorization to assume a contract and to assign it may be sought in a single motion and determined by a single order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> makes applicable the same motion procedure when the other party to the contract seeks to require the chapter officer to take some action. Section 365(d)(2) recognizes that this procedure is available to these contractual parties. This provision of the Code and subdivision of the rule apply only in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases. A motion is not necessary in chapter 7 cases because in those cases a contract is deemed rejected if the trustee does not timely assume it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> provides for the court to set a hearing on a motion made under subdivision (a) or (b). The other party to the contract should be given appropriate notice of the hearing and the court may order that other parties in interest, such as a creditors&rsquo; committee, also be given notice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> are amended to conform to the 1984 amendment to &sect;365 of the Code, which governs assumption or rejection of time share interests.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1113, governing collective bargaining agreements, was added to the Code in 1984. It sets out requirements that must be met before a collective bargaining agreement may be rejected. The application to reject a collective bargaining agreement referred to in &sect;1113 shall be made by motion. The motion to reject creates a contested matter under Rule 9014, and service is made pursuant to Rule 7004 on the representative of the employees. The time periods set forth in &sect;1113(d) govern the scheduling of the hearing and disposition of a motion to reject the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">References to time share interests are deleted as unnecessary. Time share interests are within the scope of this rule to the extent that they are governed by &sect;365 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to include chapter 12 cases.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to enable the United States trustee to appear and be heard on the issues relating to the assumption or rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases. See &sect;&sect;307, 365, and 1113 of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to delete the requirement for an actual hearing when no request for a hearing is made. See Rule 9014.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order authorizing the assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease under &sect;365(f) of the Code before the assignment is consummated. The stay under subdivision (d) does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 6006(d) is not applicable so that the executory contract or unexpired lease may be assigned immediately in accordance with the order entered by the court. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule 6006(d) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 6006</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to authorize the use of omnibus motions to reject multiple executory contracts and unexpired leases. In some cases there may be numerous executory contracts and unexpired leases, and this rule permits the combining of up to one hundred of these contracts and leases in a single motion to initiate the contested matter.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule also is amended to authorize the use of a single motion to assume or assign executory contracts and unexpired leases (i) when such contracts and leases are with a single nondebtor party, (ii) when such contracts and leases are being assigned to the same assignee, (iii) when the trustee proposes to assume, but not assign to more than one assignee, real property leases, or (iv) the court authorizes the filing of a joint motion to assume or to assume and assign executory contracts and unexpired leases under other circumstances that are not specifically recognized in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">An omnibus motion to assume, assign, or reject multiple executory contracts and unexpired leases must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in subdivision (f) of the rule, unless the court orders otherwise. These requirements are intended to ensure that the nondebtor parties to the contracts and leases receive effective notice of the motion. Among those requirements is the requirement in subdivision (f)(5) that these motions be consecutively numbered (<em>e.g.,</em> Debtor in Possession's First Omnibus Motion for Authority to Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, Debtor in Possession's Second Omnibus Motion for Authority to Assume Executory Contracts and Unexpired <!-- PDFPage:94 -->Leases, etc.). There may be a need for several of these motions in a particular case. Numbering the motions consecutively is essential to keep track of these motions on the court's docket and should avoid confusion that might otherwise result from similar or identically-titled motions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g) of the rule provides that the finality of any order respecting an executory contract or unexpired lease included in an omnibus motion shall be determined as though such contract or lease had been the subject of a separate motion. A party seeking to appeal any such order is neither required, nor permitted, to await the court's resolution of all other contracts or leases included in the omnibus motion to obtain appellate review of the order. The rule permits the listing of multiple contracts or leases for convenience, and that convenience should not impede timely review of the court's decision with respect to each contract or lease.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes After Publication</em>. Subdivision (e) of the proposed rule was amended as suggested by the NBC to insert a third category of requests that the trustee may make under an omnibus motion. The list of categories was numbered, and the new category is set out in (e)(2).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Proposed Abandonment or Disposition; Objections; Hearing</cap-smallcap>. Unless otherwise directed by the court, the trustee or debtor in possession shall give notice of a proposed abandonment or disposition of property to the United States trustee, all creditors, indenture trustees, and committees elected pursuant to &sect;705 or appointed pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code. A party in interest may file and serve an objection within 14 days of the mailing of the notice, or within the time fixed by the court. If a timely objection is made, the court shall set a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and to other entities as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Motion by Party in Interest</cap-smallcap>. A party in interest may file and serve a motion requiring the trustee or debtor in possession to abandon property of the estate.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Sections 554 and 725 of the Code permit and require abandonment and disposition of property of the estate. Pursuant to &sect;554, the trustee may abandon property but only after notice and hearing. This section is applicable in chapter 7, 11 and 13 cases. Section 725 requires the trustee to dispose of property in which someone other than the estate has an interest, prior to final distribution. It applies only in chapter 7 cases. Notice and hearing are also required conditions. Section 102(1) provides that &ldquo;notice and hearing&rdquo; is construed to mean appropriate notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Neither &sect;554 nor &sect;725 specify to whom the notices are to be sent. This rule does not apply to &sect;554(c). Pursuant to that subsection, property is deemed abandoned if it is not administered. A hearing is not required by the statute.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> requires the notices to be sent to all creditors, indenture trustees, and committees elected under &sect;705 or appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code. This may appear burdensome, expensive and inefficient but the subdivision is in keeping with the Code's requirement for notice and the Code's intent to remove the bankruptcy judge from undisputed matters. The burden, expense and inefficiency can be alleviated in large measure by incorporating the notice into or together with the notice of the meeting of creditors so that separate notices would not be required.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> implements &sect;554(b) which specifies that a party in interest may request an order that the trustee abandon property. The rule specifies that the request be by motion and, pursuant to the Code, lists the parties who should receive notice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> requires a hearing when an objection under subdivision (a) is filed or a motion under subdivision (b) is made. Filing of an objection is sufficient to require a hearing; a separate or joined request for a hearing is unnecessary since the objection itself is tantamount to such a request.</p>

See &sect;&sect;307 and 554 of the Code. Committees of retired employees appointed under &sect;1114 are not entitled to notice under subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to clarify that when a motion is made pursuant to subdivision (b), a hearing is not required if a hearing is not requested or if there is no opposition to the motion. See Rule 9014. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is new. It implements &sect;351(1), which was added to the Code by the 2005 amendments. That provision requires the trustee to notify patients that their patient records will be destroyed if they remain unclaimed for one year after the publication of a notice in an appropriate newspaper. The Code provision also requires that individualized notice be sent to each patient and to the patient's family member or other contact person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The variety of health care businesses and the range of current and former patients present the need for flexibility in the creation and publication of the notices that will be given. Nevertheless, there are some matters that must be included in any notice being given to patients, their family members, and contact persons to ensure that sufficient information is provided to these persons regarding the trustee's intent to dispose of patient records. Subdivision (a) of this rule lists the minimum requirements for notices given under &sect;351(1)(A), and subdivision (b) governs the form of notices under &sect;351(1)(B). Notices given under this rule are subject to provisions under applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of patients&rsquo; privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104&ndash;191 (HIPAA).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) directs the trustee to maintain proof of compliance with &sect;351(1)(B), but because the proof of compliance may contain patient names that should or must remain confidential, it prohibits filing the proof of compliance unless the court orders the trustee to file it under seal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) requires the trustee to file a report with the court regarding the destruction of patient records. This certification is intended to ensure that the trustee properly completed the destruction process. However, because the report will be filed with the court and ordinarily will be available to the public under &sect;107, the names, addresses, and other identifying information of patients are not to be included in the report to protect patient privacy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. Subdivision (b)(2) was amended to add the Attorney General of the State where a health care facility is located to the list of entities entitled to notice of the disposal of patient records.</p>
