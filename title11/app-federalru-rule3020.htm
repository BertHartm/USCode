<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deposit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 11 case, prior to entry of the order confirming the plan, the court may order the deposit with the trustee or debtor in possession of the consideration required by the plan to be distributed on confirmation. Any money deposited shall be kept in a special account established for the exclusive purpose of making the distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objection to and Hearing on Confirmation in a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 Case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Objection</em>. An objection to confirmation of the plan shall be filed and served on the debtor, the trustee, the proponent of the plan, any committee appointed under the Code, and any other entity designated by the court, within a time fixed by the court. Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, a copy of every objection to confirmation shall be transmitted by the objecting party to the United States trustee within the time fixed for filing objections. An objection to confirmation is governed by Rule 9014.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Hearing</em>. The court shall rule on confirmation of the plan after notice and hearing as provided in Rule 2002. If no objection is timely filed, the court may determine that the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law without receiving evidence on such issues.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order of Confirmation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The order of confirmation shall conform to the appropriate Official Form. If the plan provides for an injunction against conduct not otherwise enjoined under the Code, the order of confirmation shall (1) describe in reasonable detail all acts enjoined; (2) be specific in its terms regarding the injunction; and (3) identify the entities subject to the injunction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notice of entry of the order of confirmation shall be mailed promptly to the debtor, the trustee, creditors, equity security holders, other <!-- PDFPage:54 -->parties in interest, and, if known, to any identified entity subject to an injunction provided for in the plan against conduct not otherwise enjoined under the Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except in a chapter 9 municipality case, notice of entry of the order of confirmation shall be transmitted to the United States trustee as provided in Rule 2002(k).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Retained Power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the entry of the order of confirmation, the court may issue any other order necessary to administer the estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Stay of Confirmation Order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order confirming a plan is stayed until the expiration of 10 days after the entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Rules 10&ndash;307, 11&ndash;38, and 13&ndash;213. It applies to cases filed under chapters 9, 11 and 13. Certain subdivisions of the earlier rules have not been included, such as, a subdivision revesting title in the debtor because &sect;541 of the Code does not transfer title out of the debtor as did &sect;70a of the Bankruptcy Act; see also &sect;&sect;1141(b), 1327(b). Subdivision (b) of former Rule 13&ndash;213 is not included because its provisions are contained in the statute; see &sect;&sect;1322, 1325(b), 105.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> gives discretion to the court to require in chapter 11 cases the deposit of any consideration to be distributed on confirmation. If money is to be distributed, it is to be deposited in a special account to assure that it will not be used for any other purpose. The Code is silent in chapter 11 with respect to the need to make a deposit or the person with whom any deposit is to be made. Consequently, there is no statutory authority for any person to act in a capacity similar to the disbursing agent under former Chapter XI practice. This rule provides that only the debtor in possession or trustee should be appointed as the recipient of the deposit. Any consideration other than money, <em>e.g</em>., notes or stock may be given directly to the debtor in possession or trustee and need not be left in any kind of special account. In chapter 9 cases, &sect;944(b) provides for deposit with a disbursing agent appointed by the court of any consideration to be distributed under the plan.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> clarifies the authority of the court to conclude matters pending before it prior to confirmation and to continue to administer the estate as necessary, <em>e.g</em>., resolving objections to claims.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee monitors chapter 11, chapter 12, and chapter 13 plans and has standing to be heard regarding confirmation of a plan. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3). The amendments to subdivisions (b)(1) and (c) of this rule facilitate that role of the United States trustee. Subdivision (b)(1) is also amended to require service on the proponent of the plan of objections to confirmation. The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; in subdivision (b)(1) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">In a chapter 12 case, the court is required to conduct and conclude the hearing on confirmation of the plan within the time prescribed in &sect;1224 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is also amended to require that the confirmation order be mailed to the trustee. Reference to the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to limit its application to chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. The procedures relating to confirmation of plans in chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases are provided in Rule 3015. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order confirming a plan under chapter 9 or chapter 11 of the Code before the plan is implemented and an appeal becomes moot. Unless the court orders otherwise, any transfer of assets, issuance of securities, and cash distributions provided for in the plan may not be made before the expiration of the 10-day period. The stay of the confirmation order under subdivision (e) does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal from the confirmation order in accordance with Rule 8002.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 3020(e) is not applicable so that the plan may be implemented and distributions may be made immediately. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule 3020(e) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 3020</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2001 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to provide notice to an entity subject to an injunction provided for in a plan against conduct not otherwise enjoined by operation of the Code. This requirement is not applicable to an injunction contained in a plan if it is substantially the same as an injunction provided under the Code. The validity and effect of any injunction provided for in a plan are substantive law matters that are beyond the scope of these rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the order of confirmation identify the entities subject to the injunction requires only reasonable identification under the circumstances. If the entities that would be subject to the injunction cannot be identified by name, the order may describe them by class or category if reasonable under the circumstances. For example, it may be sufficient to identify the entities as &ldquo;all creditors of the debtor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. No changes were made in the text of the proposed amendments. The Committee Note was revised to put in a more prominent position the statement that the validity and effect of injunctions provided for in plans is beyond the scope of the rules.</p>
