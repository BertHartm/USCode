<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2007.1. Appointment of Trustee or Examiner in a Chapter 11 Reorganization Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Order To Appoint Trustee or Examiner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 11 reorganization case, a motion for an order to appoint a trustee or an examiner under &sect;1104(a) or &sect;1104(c) of the Code shall be made in accordance with Rule 9014.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Election of Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Request for an Election</em>. A request to convene a meeting of creditors for the purpose of electing a trustee in a chapter 11 reorganization case shall be filed and transmitted to the United States trustee in accordance with Rule 5005 within the time prescribed by &sect;1104(b) of the Code. Pending court approval of the person elected, any person appointed by the United States trustee under &sect;1104(d) and approved in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule shall serve as trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Manner of Election and Notice</em>. An election of a trustee under &sect;1104(b) of the Code shall be conducted in the manner provided in Rules 2003(b)(3) and 2006. Notice of the meeting of creditors convened under &sect;1104(b) shall be given as provided in Rule 2002. The United States trustee shall preside at the meeting. A proxy for the purpose of voting in the election may be solicited only by a committee of creditors appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code or by any other party entitled to solicit a proxy pursuant to Rule 2006.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Report of Election and Resolution of Disputes.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <em>Report of Undisputed Election</em>. If the election is not disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a report of the election, including the name and address of the person elected and a statement that the election is undisputed. The United States trustee shall file with the report an application for approval of the appointment in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule. The report constitutes appointment of the elected person to serve as trustee, subject to court approval, as of the date of entry of the order approving the appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Disputed Election</em>. If the election is disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a report stating that the election is disputed, informing the court of the nature of the dispute, and listing the name and address of any candidate elected under any alternative presented by the dispute. The report shall be accompanied by a verified statement by each candidate elected under each alternative pre<!-- PDFPage:33 -->sented by the dispute, setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and any person employed in the office of the United States trustee. Not later than the date on which the report of the disputed election is filed, the United States trustee shall mail a copy of the report and each verified statement to any party in interest that has made a request to convene a meeting under &sect;1104(b) or to receive a copy of the report, and to any committee appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code. Unless a motion for the resolution of the dispute is filed not later than 10 days after the United States trustee files the report, any person appointed by the United States trustee under &sect;1104(d) and approved in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule shall serve as trustee. If a motion for the resolution of the dispute is timely filed, and the court determines the result of the election and approves the person elected, the report will constitute appointment of the elected person as of the date of entry of the order approving the appointment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval of Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order approving the appointment of a trustee elected under &sect;1104(b) or appointed under &sect;1104(d), or the appointment of an examiner under &sect;1104(d) of the Code, shall be made on application of the United States trustee. The application shall state the name of the person appointed and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other parties in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and persons employed in the office of the United States trustee. Unless the person has been elected under &sect;1104(b), the application shall state the names of the parties in interest with whom the United States trustee consulted regarding the appointment. The application shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person appointed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is added to implement the 1986 amendments to &sect;1104 of the Code regarding the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case. A motion for an order to appoint a trustee or examiner is a contested matter. Although the court decides whether the appointment is warranted under the particular facts of the case, it is the United States trustee who makes the appointment pursuant to &sect;1104(c) of the Code. The appointment is subject to approval of the court, however, which may be obtained by application of the United States trustee. Section 1104(c) of the Code requires that the appointment be made after consultation with parties in interest and that the person appointed be disinterested.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee's office be revealed is not intended to enlarge the definition of &ldquo;disinterested person&rdquo; in &sect;101(13) of the Code, to supersede executive regulations or other laws relating to appointments by United States trustees, or to otherwise restrict the United States trustee's discretion in making appointments. This information is required, however, in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the appointment process and to give the court all information that may be relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in approving the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to implement the 1994 amendments to &sect;1104 of the Code regarding the election of a trustee in a chapter 11 case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Eligibility for voting in an election for a chapter 11 trustee is determined in accordance with Rule 2003(b)(3). Creditors whose claims are deemed filed under &sect;1111(a) are treated for voting purposes as creditors who have filed proofs of claim.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proxies for the purpose of voting in the election may be solicited only by a creditors&rsquo; committee appointed under &sect;1102 or by any other party entitled to solicit proxies pursuant to Rule 2006. Therefore, a trustee or examiner who has served in the case, or a committee of equity security holders appointed under &sect;1102, may not solicit proxies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures for reporting disputes to the court derive from similar provisions in Rule 2003(d) applicable to chapter 7 cases. An election may be disputed by a party in interest or by the United States trustee. For example, if the United States trustee believes that the person elected is ineligible to serve as trustee because the person is not &ldquo;disinterested,&rdquo; the United States trustee should file a report disputing the election.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is deleted from subdivision (b), redesignated as subdivision (c), to avoid any negative inference with respect to the availability of procedures for obtaining review of the United States trustee's acts or failure to act pursuant to Rule 2020.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 2017.1</em>. The published draft of proposed new subdivision (b)(3) of Rule 2017.1 [2007.1], and the Committee Note, was substantially revised to implement Mr. Patchan's recommendations (described above), to clarify how a disputed election will be reported, and to make stylistic improvements.</p>
