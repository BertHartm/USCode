<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payment or Transfer to Attorney Before Order for Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion by any party in interest or on the court's own initiative, the court after notice and a hearing may determine whether any payment of money or any transfer of property by the debtor, made directly or indirectly and in contemplation of the filing of a petition under the Code by or against the debtor or before entry of the order for relief in an involuntary case, to an attorney for services rendered or to be rendered is excessive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment or Transfer to Attorney After Order for Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion by the debtor, the United States trustee, or on the court's own initiative, the court after notice and a hearing may determine whether any payment of money or any transfer of property or any agreement therefor, by the debtor to an attorney after entry of an order for relief in a case under the Code is excessive, whether the payment or transfer is made or is to be made directly or indirectly, if the payment, transfer, or agreement therefor is for services in any way related to the case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from &sect;60d of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 220 and implements &sect;329 of the Code. Information required to be disclosed by the attorney for a debtor by &sect;329 of the Code and by the debtor in his Statement of Financial Affairs (Item #15 of Form No. 7, Item #20 of Form No. 8) will assist the court in determining whether to proceed under this rule. Section 60d was enacted in recognition of &ldquo;the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in employing counsel to protect him in view of financial reverses and probable failure.&rdquo; <em>In re Wood & Henderson</em>, 210 U.S. 246, 253 (1908). This rule, like &sect;60d of the Act and &sect;329 of the Code, is premised on the need for and appropriateness of judicial scrutiny of arrangements <!-- PDFPage:37 -->between a debtor and his attorney to protect the creditors of the estate and the debtor against overreaching by an officer of the court who is in a peculiarly advantageous position to impose on both the creditors and his client. 2 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;329.02 (15th ed. 1980); MacLachlan, <em>Bankruptcy</em> 318 (1956). Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule is not to be construed to permit post-petition payments or transfers which may be avoided under other provisions of the Code.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to include within subdivision (a) a payment or transfer of property by the debtor to an attorney after the filing of an involuntary petition but before the order for relief. Any party in interest should be able to make a motion for a determination of whether such payment or transfer is excessive because the funds or property transferred may be property of the estate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee supervises and monitors the administration of bankruptcy cases other than chapter 9 cases and pursuant to &sect;307 of the Code may raise, appear and be heard on issues relating to fees paid to the debtor's attorney. It is consistent with that role to expect the United States trustee to review statements filed under Rule 2016(b) and to file motions relating to excessive fees pursuant to &sect;329 of the Code.</p>
