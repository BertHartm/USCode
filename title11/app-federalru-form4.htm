<p class="note-body">The form has been amended to delete reference to the specific subsection of 11 U.S.C. &sect;101 in connection with the definition of the term &ldquo;insider.&rdquo; Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code contains numerous definitions, and statutory amendments from time to time have resulted in the renumbering of many of its subsections. The more general reference will avoid the necessity to amend the form further in the event of future amendments to &sect;101.</p>
