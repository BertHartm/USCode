<p class="note-body">This rule supplements 28 U.S.C. &sect;773. A record of proceedings before the bankruptcy judge is to be made whenever practicable. By whatever means the record is made, subdivision (a) requires that the preparer of the record certify and file the original notes, tape recording, or other form of sound recording of the proceedings. Similarly, if a transcript is requested, the preparer is to file a certified copy with the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from 28 U.S.C. &sect;753(f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 511(c). This subdivision extends to a sound recording the same evidentiary status as a transcript under 28 U.S.C. &sect;773(b).</p>
