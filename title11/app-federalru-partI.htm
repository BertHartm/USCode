<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under &sect;&sect;301&ndash;303 of the Code, a voluntary or involuntary case is commenced by filing a petition with the bankruptcy court. The voluntary petition may request relief under chapter 7, 9, 11, or 13 whereas an involuntary petition may be filed only under chapter 7 or 11. Section 109 of the Code specifies the types of debtors for whom the different forms of relief are available and &sect;303(a) indicates the persons against whom involuntary petitions may be filed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule in subdivision (a) is in harmony with the Code in that it requires the filing to be with the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="note-body">The number of copies of the petition to be filed is specified in this rule but a local rule may require additional copies. This rule provides for filing sufficient copies for the court's files and for the trustee in a chapter 7 or 13 case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Official Form No. 1 may be used to seek relief voluntarily under any of the chapters. Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008 and 9011(c). As provided in &sect;362(a) of the Code, the filing of a petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against the debtor, property of the debtor, and property of the estate.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rules 1002(a), governing a voluntary petition, 1003(a), governing an involuntary petition, and 1003(e), governing a petition in a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding, are combined into this Rule 1002. If a bankruptcy clerk has been appointed for the district, the petition is filed with the bankruptcy clerk. Otherwise, the petition is filed with the clerk of the district court.</p>
<p class="note-body">The elimination of the reference to the Official Forms of the petition is not intended to change the practice. Rule 9009 provides that the Official Forms &ldquo;shall be observed and used&rdquo; in cases and proceedings under the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> which provided for the distribution of copies of the petition to agencies of the United States has been deleted. Some of these agencies no longer wish to receive copies of the petition, while others not included in subdivision (b) have now requested copies. The Director of the Administrative Office will determine on an ongoing basis which government agencies will be provided a copy of the petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The number of copies of a petition that must be filed is a matter for local rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from Rule X&ndash;1002(a). The duties of the United States trustee pursuant to the Code and 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a) require that the United States trustee be apprised of the commencement of every case under chapters 7, 11, 12 and 13 and this is most easily accomplished by providing that office with a copy of the petition. Although 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a) does not give the United States trustee an administrative role in chapter 9 cases, &sect;1102 of the Code requires the United States trustee to appoint committees and that section is applicable in chapter 9 cases pursuant to &sect;901(a). It is therefore appropriate that the United States trustee receive a copy of every chapter 9 petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notwithstanding subdivision (b), pursuant to Rule 5005(b)(3), the clerk is not required to transmit a copy of the petition to the United States trustee if the United States trustee requests that it not be transmitted. Many rules require the clerk to transmit a certain document to the United States trustee, but Rule 5005(b)(3) relieves the clerk of that duty under this or any other rule if the United States trustee requests that such document not be transmitted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Transferor or Transferee of Claim</cap-smallcap>. A transferor or transferee of a claim shall annex to the original and each copy of the petition a copy of all documents evidencing the transfer, whether transferred unconditionally, for security, or otherwise, and a signed statement that the claim was not transferred for the purpose of commencing the case and setting forth the consideration for and terms of the transfer. An entity that has transferred or acquired a claim for the purpose of commencing a case for liquidation under chapter 7 or for reorganization under chapter 11 shall not be a qualified petitioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Joinder of Petitioners After Filing</cap-smallcap>. If the answer to an involuntary petition filed by fewer than three creditors avers the existence of 12 or more creditors, the debtor shall file with the answer a list of all creditors with their addresses, a brief statement of the nature of their claims, and the amounts thereof. If it appears that there are 12 or more creditors as provided in &sect;303(b) of the Code, the court shall afford a reasonable opportunity for other creditors to join in the petition before a hearing is held thereon.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Official Form No. 11 (Involuntary Case: Creditors&rsquo; Petition), is prescribed for use by petitioning creditors to have a debtor's assets liquidated under chapter 7 of the Code or the business reorganized under chapter 11. It contains the required allegations as specified in &sect;303(b) of the Code. Official Form 12 is prescribed for use by fewer than all the general partners to obtain relief for the partnership as governed by &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code and Rule 1004(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the number of copies to be filed is specified in Rule 1002, a local rule may require additional copies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008 and 9011(c). The petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court. This provision implements &sect;303(b) which provides that an involuntary case is commenced by filing the petition with the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">As provided in &sect;362 of the Code, the filing of the petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against the debtor, the debtor's property and property of the estate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> retains the explicitness of former Bankruptcy Rule 104(d) that a transfer of a claim for the purpose of commencing a case under the Code is a ground for disqualification of a party to the transfer as a petitioner.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6 --><p class="note-body">Section 303(b) &ldquo;is not intended to overrule Bankruptcy Rule 104(d), which places certain restrictions on the transfer of claims for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case.&rdquo; House Report No. 95&ndash;595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 322; Senate Report No. 95&ndash;989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978) 33.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision requires disclosure of any transfer of the petitioner's claim as well as a transfer to the petitioner and applies to transfers for security as well as unconditional transfers, <em>Cf. In re 69th & Crandon Bldg. Corp</em>., 97 F.2d 392, 395 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 629 (1938), recognizing the right of a creditor to sign a bankruptcy petition notwithstanding a prior assignment of his claim for the purpose of security. This rule does not, however, qualify the requirement of &sect;303(b)(1) that a petitioning creditor must have a claim not contingent as to liability.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Section 303(c) of the Code permits a creditor to join in the petition at any time before the case is dismissed or relief is ordered. While this rule does not require the court to give all creditors notice of the petition, the list of creditors filed by the debtor affords a petitioner the information needed to enable him to give notice for the purpose of obtaining the co-petitioners required to make the petition sufficient. After a reasonable opportunity has been afforded other creditors to join in an involuntary petition, the hearing on the petition should be held without further delay.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. This subdivision implements &sect;304. A petition for relief under &sect;304 may only be filed by a foreign representative who is defined in &sect;101(20) generally as a representative of an estate in a foreign proceeding. The term &ldquo;foreign proceeding&rdquo; is defined in &sect;101(19).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 304(b) permits a petition filed thereunder to be contested by a party in interest. Subdivision (e)(2) therefore requires that the summons and petition be served on any person against whom the relief permitted by &sect;304(b) is sought as well as on any other party the court may direct.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rules applicable to the procedure when an involuntary petition is filed are made applicable generally when a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is commenced. These rules include Rule 1010 with respect to issuance and service of a summons, Rule 1011 concerning responsive pleadings and motions, and Rule 1018 which makes various rules in Part VII applicable in proceedings on contested petitions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The venue for a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1474.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">After filing of an involuntary petition under &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code, (1) the petitioning partners or other petitioners shall promptly send to or serve on each general partner who is not a petitioner a copy of the petition; and (2) the clerk shall promptly issue a summons for service on each general partner who is not a petitioner.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 105 and complements &sect;&sect;301 and 303(b)(3) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> specifies that while all general partners must consent to the filing of a voluntary petition, it is not necessary that they all execute the petition. It may be executed and filed on behalf of the partnership by fewer than all.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> implements &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code which provides that an involuntary petition may be filed by fewer than all the general partners or, when all the general partners are debtors, by a general partner, trustee of the partner or creditors of the partnership. Rule 1010, which governs service of a petition and summons in an involuntary case, specifies the time and mode of service on the partnership. When a petition is filed against a partnership under &sect;303(b)(3), this rule requires an additional service on the nonfiling general partners. It is the purpose of this subdivision to protect the interests of the nonpetitioning partners and the partnership.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 303(b)(3)(A) of the Code provides that fewer than all of the general partners in a partnership may commence an involuntary case against the partnership. There is no counterpart provision in the Code setting out the manner in which a partnership commences a voluntary case. The Supreme Court has held in the corporate context that applicable nonbankruptcy law determines whether authority exists for a particular debtor to commence a bankruptcy case. <em>See Price v. Gurney</em>, 324 U.S. 100 (1945). The lower courts have followed this rule in the partnership context as well. <em>See, e.g., Jolly v. Pittore</em>, 170 B.R. 793 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); <em>Union Planters National Bank v. Hunters Horn Associates</em>, 158 B.R. 729 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1993); <em>In re Channel 64 Joint Venture</em>, 61 B.R. 255 (Bankr. S.D. Oh. 1986). Rule 1004(a) could be construed as requiring the consent of all of the general partners to the filing of a voluntary petition, even if fewer than all of the general partners would have the authority under applicable nonbankruptcy law to commence a bankruptcy case for the partnership. Since this is a matter of substantive law beyond the scope of these rules, Rule 1004(a) is deleted as is the designation of subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is retitled to reflect that it applies only to involuntary petitions filed against partnerships.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement the Judicial Conference policy to limit the disclosure of a party's social security number and similar identifiers. Under the rule, as amended, only the last four digits of the debtor's social security number need be disclosed. Publication of the employer identification number does not present the same identity theft or privacy protection issues. Therefore, the caption must include the full employer identification number.</p>
<p class="note-body">Debtors must submit with the petition a statement setting out their social security numbers. This enables the clerk to include the full social security number on the notice of the section 341 meeting of creditors, but the statement itself is not submitted in the case or maintained in the case file.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. The rule was changed only slightly after publication. The rule was changed to make clear that only the debtor's social security number is truncated to the final four digits, but other numerical identifiers must be set out in full. The rule also was amended to include a requirement that a debtor list other federal taxpayer identification numbers that may be in use.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to require the disclosure of all names used by the debtor in the past eight years. Section 727(a)(8) was amended in 2005 to extend the time between chapter 7 discharges from six to eight years, and the rule is amended to implement that change. The rule also is amended to require the disclosure of the last four digits of an individual debtor's taxpayer-identification number. This truncation of the number applies only to individual debtors. This is consistent with the requirements of Rule 9037.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Action on Application</em>. Prior to the meeting of creditors, the court may order the filing fee paid to the clerk or grant leave to pay in installments and fix the number, amount and dates of payment. The number of installments shall not exceed four, and the final installment shall be payable not later than 120 days after filing the petition. For cause shown, the court may extend the time of any installment, provided the last installment is paid not later than 180 days after filing the petition.</p>

<p class="note-body">28 U.S.C. &sect;1930 specifies the filing fees for petitions under chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 of the Code. It also permits the payment in installments by individual debtors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 107. The administrative cost of installments in excess of four is disproportionate to the benefits conferred. Prolonging the period beyond 180 days after the commencement of the case causes undesirable delays in administration. Paragraph (2) accordingly continues the imposition of a maximum of four on the number of installments and retains the maximum period of installment payments allowable on an original application at 120 days. Only in extraordinary cases should it be necessary to give an applicant an extension beyond the four months. The requirement of paragraph (3) that filing fees be paid in full before the debtor may pay an attorney for services in connection with the case codifies the rule declared in <em>In re Latham</em>, 271 Fed. 538 (N.D.N.Y. 1921), and <em>In re Darr</em>, 232 Fed. 415 (N.D. Cal. 1916).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3)</em> is expanded to prohibit payments by the debtor or the chapter 13 trustee not only to attorneys but to any person who renders services to the debtor in connection with the case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Judicial Conference prescribes miscellaneous fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(b). In 1992, a $30 miscellaneous administrative fee was prescribed for all chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases. The Judicial Conference fee schedule was amended in 1993 to provide that an individual debtor may pay this fee in installments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of this rule is amended to clarify that every petition must be accompanied by any fee prescribed under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(b) that is required to be paid when a petition is filed, as well as the filing fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(a). By defining &ldquo;filing fee&rdquo; to include Judicial Conference fees, the procedures set forth in subdivision (b) for paying the filing fee in installments will also apply with respect to any Judicial Conference fee required to be paid at the commencement of the case.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8 --><p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1006</em>. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change in subdivision (a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to include a reference to new subdivision (c), which deals with fee waivers under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(f), which was added in 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to delete the sentence requiring a disclosure that the debtor has not paid an attorney or other person in connection with the case. Inability to pay the filing fee in installments is one of the requirements for a fee waiver under the 2005 revisions to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(f). If the attorney payment prohibition were retained, payment of an attorney's fee would render many debtors ineligible for installment payments and thus enhance their eligibility for the fee waiver. The deletion of this prohibition from the rule, which was not statutorily required, ensures that debtors who have the financial ability to pay the fee in installments will do so rather than request a waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) is amended in conformance with the changes to subdivision (b)(1) to reflect the 2005 amendments. The change is meant to clarify that subdivision (b)(3) refers to payments made after the debtor has filed the bankruptcy case and after the debtor has received permission to pay the fee in installments. Otherwise, the subdivision may conflict with the intent and effect of the amendments to subdivision (b)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. No changes were made after publication.</p>

Notice of an extension shall be given to the United States trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>List of </cap-smallcap>20<cap-smallcap> Largest Creditors in Chapter </cap-smallcap>9<cap-smallcap> Municipality Case or Chapter </cap-smallcap>11<cap-smallcap> Reorganization Case</cap-smallcap>.

In an involuntary chapter 11 reorganization case, such list shall be filed by the debtor within 2 days after entry of the order for relief under &sect;303(h) of the Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>List in Chapter </cap-smallcap>9<cap-smallcap> Municipality Cases</cap-smallcap>. The list required by subdivision (a) of this rule shall be filed by the debtor in a chapter 9 municipality case within such time as the court shall fix. If a proposed plan requires a revision of assessments so that the proportion of special assessments or special taxes to be assessed against some real property will be different from the proportion in effect at the date the petition is filed, the debtor shall also file a list showing the name and address of each known holder of title, legal or equitable, to real property adversely affected. On motion for cause shown, the court may modify the requirements of this subdivision and subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>

If any of the property required to be reported under this subdivision is claimed by the debtor as exempt, the <!-- PDFPage:10 -->debtor shall claim the exemptions in the supplemental schedule. The duty to file a supplemental schedule in accordance with this subdivision continues notwithstanding the closing of the case, except that the schedule need not be filed in a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case with respect to property acquired after entry of the order confirming a chapter 11 plan or discharging the debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of List of Security Holders</cap-smallcap>. After notice and hearing and for cause shown, the court may direct an entity other than the debtor or trustee to disclose any list of security holders of the debtor in its possession or under its control, indicating the name, address and security held by any of them.

<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) <cap-smallcap>Transmission to United States Trustee</cap-smallcap>. The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every list, schedule, and statement filed pursuant to subdivision (a)(1), (a)(2), (b), (d), or (h) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Infants and Incompetent Persons</cap-smallcap>.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is an adaptation of former Rules 108, 8&ndash;106, 10&ndash;108 and 11&ndash;11. As specified in the rule, it is applicable in all types of cases filed under the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> requires at least a list of creditors with their names and addresses to be filed with the petition. This list is needed for notice of the meeting of creditors (Rule 2002) and notice of the order for relief (&sect;342 of the Code). The list will also serve to meet the requirements of &sect;521(1) of the Code. Subdivision (a) recognizes that it may be impossible to file the schedules required by &sect;521(1) and subdivision (b) of the rule at the time the petition is filed but in order for the case to proceed expeditiously and efficiently it is necessary that the clerk have the names and addresses of creditors. It should be noted that subdivision (d) of the rule requires a special list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors in chapter 9 and 11 cases. That list is for the purpose of selecting a committee of unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from former Rule 11&ndash;11 and conforms with &sect;521. This subdivision indicates the forms to be used. The court may dispense with the filing of schedules and the statement of affairs pursuant to &sect;521.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (c) and (f)</em> specify the time periods for filing the papers required by the rule as well as the number of copies. The provisions dealing with an involuntary case are derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108. Under the Code, a chapter 11 case may be commenced by an involuntary petition (&sect;303(a)), whereas under the Act, a Chapter XI case could have been commenced only by a voluntary petition. A motion for an extension of time to file the schedules and statements is required to be made on notice to parties, as the court may direct, including a creditors&rsquo; committee if one has been appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code and a trustee or examiner if one has been appointed pursuant to &sect;1104 of the Code. Although written notice is preferable, it is not required by the rule; in proper circumstances the notice may be by telephone or otherwise.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is new and requires that a list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors, excluding insiders as defined in &sect;101(25) of the Code, be filed with the petition. The court, pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code, is required to appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after the order for relief. That committee generally is to consist of the seven largest unsecured creditors who are willing to serve. The list should, as indicated on Official Form No. 9, specify the nature and amount of the claim. It is important for the court to be aware of the different types of claims existing in the case and this form should supply such information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> applies only in chapter 9 municipality cases. It gives greater discretion to the court to determine the time for filing a list of creditors and any other matter related to the list. A list of creditors must at some point be filed since one is required by &sect;924 of the Code. When the plan affects special assessments, the definitions in &sect;902(2) and (3) for &ldquo;special tax payer&rdquo; and &ldquo;special tax payer affected by the plan&rdquo; become relevant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> is derived from former Rules 108(c) and 11&ndash;11. Nondebtor general partners are liable to the partnership's trustee for any deficiency in the partnership's estate to pay creditors in full as provided by &sect;723 of the Code. Subdivision (g) authorizes the court to require a partner to file a statement of personal assets and liabilities to provide the trustee with the relevant information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108(e) for chapter 7, 11 and 13 purposes. It implements the provisions in and language of &sect;541(a)(5) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (i) and (j)</em> are adapted from &sect;&sect;165 and 166 of the Act and former Rule 10&ndash;108(b) and (c) without change in substance. The term &ldquo;party in interest&rdquo; is not defined in the Code or the rules, but reference may be made to &sect;1109(b) of the Code. In the context of this subdivision, the term would include the debtor, the trustee, any indenture trustee, creditor, equity security holder or committee appointed pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (k)</em> is derived from former Rules 108(d) and 10&ndash;108(a).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b), (c), and (g)</em> are amended to provide for the filing of a schedule of current income and current expenditures and the individual debtor's statement of intention. These documents are required by the 1984 amendments to &sect;521 of the Code. Official Form No. 6A is prescribed for use by an individual debtor for filing <!-- PDFPage:11 -->a schedule of current income and current expenditures in a chapter 7 or chapter 11 case. Although a partnership or corporation is also required by &sect;521(1) to file a schedule of current income and current expenditures, no Official Form is prescribed therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">The time for filing the statement of intention is governed by &sect;521(2)(A). A copy of the statement of intention must be served on the trustee and the creditors named in the statement within the same time. The provisions of subdivision (c) governing the time for filing when a chapter 11 or chapter 13 case is converted to a chapter 7 case have been omitted from subdivision (c) as amended. Filing after conversion is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em> has been abrogated. The number of copies of the documents required by this rule will be determined by local rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em> is amended to include a direct reference to &sect;541(a)(5).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (k)</em> provides that the court may not order an entity other than the debtor to prepare and file the statement of intention.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">References to Official Form numbers and to the Chapter 13 Statement are deleted and subdivision (b) is amended in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms. The debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case shall file the list, schedules and statements required in subdivisions (a)(1), (b)(1), and (h). It is expected that the information currently provided in the Chapter 13 Statement will be included in the schedules and statements as revised not later than the effective date of these rule amendments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c)</em> are amended to provide the United States trustee with notice of any motion to extend the time for the filing of any lists, schedules, or statements. Such notice enables the United States trustee to take appropriate steps to avoid undue delay in the administration of the case. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(G). Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c) are amended further to provide notice to committees elected under &sect;705 or appointed pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code. Committees of retired employees appointed pursuant to &sect;1114 are not included.</p>
<p class="note-body">The additions of references to unexpired leases in subdivisions (b)(1) and (g) indicate that the schedule requires the inclusion of unexpired leases as well as other executory contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; in subdivisions (b)(1), (e), and (g) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (l)</em>, which is derived from Rule X&ndash;1002(a), provides the United States trustee with the information required to perform certain administrative duties such as the appointment of a committee of unsecured creditors. In a chapter 7 case, the United States trustee should be aware of the debtor's intention with respect to collateral that secures a consumer debt so that the United States trustee may monitor the progress of the case. Pursuant to &sect;307 of the Code, the United States trustee has standing to raise, appear and be heard on issues and the lists, schedules and statements contain information that, when provided to the United States trustee, enable that office to participate effectively in the case. The United States trustee has standing to move to dismiss a chapter 7 or 13 case for failure to file timely the list, schedules or statement required by &sect;521(1) of the Code. See &sect;&sect;707(a)(3) and 1307(c)(9). It is therefore necessary for the United States trustee to receive notice of any extension of time to file such documents. Upon request, the United States trustee also may receive from the trustee or debtor in possession a list of equity security holders.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to provide that schedules and statements filed prior to the conversion of a case to another chapter shall be deemed filed in the converted case, whether or not the case was a chapter 7 case prior to conversion. This amendment is in recognition of the 1991 amendments to the Official Forms that abrogated the Chapter 13 Statement and made the same forms for schedules and statements applicable in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision also contains a technical correction. The phrase &ldquo;superseded case&rdquo; creates the erroneous impression that conversion of a case results in a new case that is distinct from the original case. The effect of conversion of a case is governed by &sect;348 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1007(c)</em>. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">[<em>Subdivision (a)</em>.] This rule is amended to require the debtor to file a corporate ownership statement setting out the information described in Rule 7007.1. Requiring debtors to file the statement provides the court with an opportunity to make judicial disqualification determinations at the outset of the case. This could reduce problems later in the case by preventing the initial assignment of the case to a judge who holds a financial interest in a parent company of the debtor or some other entity that holds a significant ownership interest in the debtor. Moreover, by including the disclosure statement filing requirement at the commencement of the case, the debtor does not have to make the same disclosure filing each time it is involved in an adversary proceeding throughout the case. The debtor also must file supplemental statements as changes in ownership might arise.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<p class="note-body">[<em>Subdivisions (c) and (f)</em>.] The rule is amended to add a requirement that a debtor submit a statement setting out the debtor's social security number. The addition is necessary because of the corresponding amendment to Rule 1005 which now provides that the caption of the petition includes only the final four digits of the debtor's social security number. The debtor submits the statement, but it is not filed, nor is it included in the case file. The statement provides the information necessary to include on the service copy of the notice required under Rule 2002(a)(1). It will also provide the information to facilitate the ability of creditors to search the court record by a search of a social security number already in the creditor's possession.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. The rule amendment is made in response to the extensive commentary that urged the Advisory Committee to continue the obligation contained in current Rule 1005 that a debtor must include his or her social security number on the caption of the bankruptcy petition. Rule 1005 is amended to limit that disclosure to the final four digits of the social security number, and Rule 1007 is amended to reinstate the obligation in a manner that will provide more protection of the debtor's privacy while continuing access to the information to those persons with legitimate need for that data. The debtor must disclose the information, but the method of disclosure is by a verified statement that is submitted to the clerk. The statement is not filed in the case and does not become a part of the court record. Therefore, <!-- PDFPage:12 -->it enables the clerk to deliver that information to the creditors and the trustee in the case, but it does not become a part of the court record governed by &sect;107 of the Bankruptcy Code and is not available to the public.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Notice to creditors and other parties in interest is essential to the operation of the bankruptcy system. Sending notice requires a convenient listing of the names and addresses of the entities to whom notice must be sent, and virtually all of the bankruptcy courts have adopted a local rule requiring the submission of a list of these entities with the petition and in a particular format. These lists are commonly called the &ldquo;mailing matrix.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Given the universal adoption of these local rules, the need for such lists in all cases is apparent. Consequently, the rule is amended to require the debtor to submit such a list at the commencement of the case. This list may be amended when necessary. <em>See</em> Rule 1009(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">The content of the list is described by reference to Schedules D through H of the Official Forms rather than by reference to creditors or persons holding claims. The cross reference to the Schedules as the source of the names for inclusion in the list ensures that persons such as codebtors or nondebtor parties to executory contracts and unexpired leases will receive appropriate notices in the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">While this rule renders unnecessary, in part, local rules on the subject, this rule does not direct any particular format or form for the list to take. Local rules still may govern those particulars of the list.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect that subdivision (a)(1) no longer requires the debtor to file a schedule of liabilities with the petition in lieu of a list of creditors. The filing of the list is mandatory, and subdivision (b) of the rule requires the filing of schedules. Thus, subdivision (c) no longer needs to account for the possibility that the debtor can delay filing a schedule of liabilities when the petition is accompanied by a list of creditors. Subdivision (c) simply addresses the situation in which the debtor does not file schedules or statements with the petition, and the procedure for seeking an extension of time for filing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The title of this rule is expanded to refer to &ldquo;documents&rdquo; in conformity with the 2005 amendments to &sect;521 and related provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that include a wider range of documentary requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to require that any foreign representative filing a petition for recognition to commence a case under chapter 15, which was added to the Code in 2005, file a list of entities with whom the debtor is engaged in litigation in the United States. The foreign representative filing the petition for recognition must also list any entities against whom provisional relief is being sought as well as all persons or bodies authorized to administer foreign proceedings of the debtor. This should ensure that entities most interested in the case, or their representatives, will receive notice of the petition under Rule 2002(q).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(4) is amended to require the foreign representative who files a petition for recognition under chapter 15 to file the documents described in &sect;1515 of the Code as well as a corporate ownership statement. The subdivision is also amended to identify the foreign representative in language that more closely follows the text of the Code. Former subdivision (a)(4) is renumbered as subdivision (a)(5) and stylistic changes were made to the subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1) addresses schedules, statements, and other documents that the debtor must file unless the court orders otherwise and other than in a case under chapter 9. This subdivision is amended to include documentary requirements added by the 2005 amendments to &sect;521 that apply to the same group of debtors and have the same time limits as the existing requirements of (b)(1). Consistent with the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107&ndash;347, the payment advices should be redacted before they are filed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to conform to the renumbering of the subsections of &sect;521.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivisions (b)(3) through (b)(8) are new and implement the 2005 amendments to the Code. Subdivision (b)(3) provides for the filing of a document relating to the credit counseling requirement provided by the 2005 amendments to &sect;109 in the context of an Official Form that warns the debtor of the consequences of failing to comply with the credit counseling requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(4) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in &sect;101, for certain chapter 7 debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses required by the 2005 amendments to &sect;707(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(5) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in &sect;101, for individual chapter 11 debtors. The 2005 amendments to &sect;1129(a)(15) condition plan confirmation for individual debtors on the commitment of disposable income, as defined in &sect;1325(b)(2), which is based on current monthly income.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(6) addresses the filing of information about current monthly income, as defined in &sect;101, for chapter 13 debtors and, if required, additional calculations of expenses. These changes are necessary because the 2005 amendments to &sect;1325 require that the determination of disposable income begin with current monthly income.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(7) reflects the 2005 amendments to &sect;&sect;727 and 1328 of the Code that condition the receipt of a discharge on the completion of a personal financial management course, with certain exceptions. Certain individual chapter 11 debtors may also be required to complete a personal financial management course under &sect;727(a)(11) as incorporated by &sect;1141(d)(3)(C). To evidence compliance with that requirement, the subdivision requires the debtor to file the appropriate Official Form certifying that the debtor has completed the personal financial management course.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(8) requires an individual debtor in a case under chapter 11, 12, or 13 to file a statement that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the restrictions on a homestead exemption as set out in &sect;522(q) of the Code are applicable. Sections 1141(d)(5)(C), 1228(f), and 1328(h) each provide that the court shall not enter a discharge order unless it finds that there is no reasonable cause to believe that &sect;522(q) applies. Requiring the debtor to submit a statement to that effect in cases under chapters 11, 12, and 13 in which an exemption is claimed in excess of the amount allowed under &sect;522(q)(1) provides the court with a basis to conclude, in the absence of any contrary information, that &sect;522(q) does not apply. Creditors receive notice under Rule 2002(f)(11) of the time to request postponement of the entry of the discharge to permit an opportunity to challenge the debtor's assertions in the Rule 1007(b)(8) statement in appropriate cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is amended to include time limits for the filing requirements added to subdivision (b) due to the 2005 amendments to the Code, and to make conforming amendments. Separate time limits are provided for the documentation of credit counseling and for the statement of the completion of the financial management course. While most documents relating to credit counseling must be filed with the voluntary petition, the credit counseling certificate and debt repayment plan can be filed within 15 days of the filing of a voluntary petition if the debtor files a statement under subdivision (b)(3)(B) with the petition. Sections 727(a)(11), 1141(d)(3), and 1328(g) of the Code require individual debtors to complete a personal financial management course prior to the entry of a discharge. The amendment allows the court to enlarge the deadline for <!-- PDFPage:13 -->the debtor to file the statement of completion. Because no party is harmed by the enlargement, no specific restriction is placed on the court's discretion to enlarge the deadline, even after its expiration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) of the rule is also amended to recognize the limitation on the extension of time to file schedules and statements when the debtor is a small business debtor. Section 1116(3), added to the Code in 2005, establishes a specific standard for courts to apply in the event that the debtor in possession or the trustee seeks an extension for filing these forms for a period beyond 30 days after the order for relief.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. Subdivision (a)(4) was amended to insert the requirement that the foreign representative who files the chapter 15 petition must file the corporate ownership statement. Subdivision (b)(4) was amended to provide that all individual debtors rather than just those whose debts are primarily consumer debts must file the statement of current monthly income. Subdivisions (b)(7) and (c) were amended to make the obligation to file a statement of the completion of a personal financial management course applicable to certain individual chapter 11 debtors as well as to individual debtors in chapters 7 and 13. Subdivision (c) is also amended to provide the court with broad discretion to enlarge the time to file the statement of completion of a personal financial management course. The Committee Note was amended to explain these changes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. Each deadline in the rule of fewer than 30 days is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;20-day periods become 21-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;25-day periods become 28-day periods</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2010 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2)</em>. Subdivision (a)(2) is amended to shorten the time for a debtor to file a list of the creditors included on the various schedules filed or to be filed in the case. This list provides the information necessary for the clerk to provide notice of the &sect;341meeting of creditors in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Subdivision (c) is amended to provide additional time for individual debtors in chapter 7 to file the statement of completion of a course in personal financial management. This change is made in conjunction with an amendment to Rule 5009 requiring the clerk to provide notice to debtors of the consequences of not filing the statement in a timely manner.</p>

<p class="note-body">The 1996 amendments to Rule 7004 and the 1993 amendments to Rule 4, F.R.Civ.P., have not affected the availability of service by first class mail in accordance with Rule 7004(b) for the service of a summons and petition in an involuntary case commenced under &sect;303 or an ancillary case commenced under &sect;304 of the Code.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to implement the 2005 amendments to the Code, which repealed &sect;304 and replaced it with chapter 15 governing ancillary and other cross-border cases. Under chapter 15, a foreign representative commences a case by filing a petition for recognition of a pending foreign nonmain proceeding. The amendment requires service of the summons and petition on the debtor and any entity against whom the representative is seeking provisional relief. Until the court enters a recognition order under &sect;1517, no stay is in effect unless the court enters some form of provisional relief under &sect;1519. Thus, only those entities against whom specific provisional relief is sought need to be served. The court may, however, direct that service be made on additional entities as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule does not apply to a petition for recognition of a foreign main proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is also amended by renumbering the prior rule as subdivision (a) and adding a new subdivision (b) requiring any corporate creditor that files or joins an involuntary petition to file a corporate ownership statement.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Who May Contest Petition</cap-smallcap>. The debtor named in an involuntary petition, or a party in interest to a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding, may contest the petition.

Defenses and objections to the petition shall be presented in the manner prescribed by Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. and shall be filed and served within 21 days after service of the summons, except that if service is made by publication on a party or partner not residing or found within the state in which the court sits, the court shall prescribe the time for filing and serving the response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Motion</cap-smallcap>. Service of a motion under Rule 12(b) F.R.Civ.P. shall extend the time for filing and serving a responsive pleading as permitted by Rule 12(a) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Claims Against Petitioners</cap-smallcap>. A claim against a petitioning creditor may not be asserted in the answer except for the purpose of defeating the petition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Corporate Ownership Statement</cap-smallcap>. If the entity responding to the involuntary petition or the petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding is a corporation, the entity shall file with its first appearance, pleading, motion, response, or other request addressed to the court a corporate ownership statement containing the information described in Rule 7007.1.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 112. A petition filed by fewer than all the general partners under Rule 1004(b) to have an order for relief entered with respect to the partnership is referred to as a petition against the partnership because of the adversary character of the proceeding it commences. <em>Cf</em>. &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code; 2 Collier <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;303.05[5][a] (15th ed. 1981); 2 <em>id</em>. &nbsp;18.33[2], 18.46 (14th ed. 1966). One who denies an allegation of membership in the firm is nevertheless recognized as a party entitled to contest a petition filed against a partnership under subdivision (b) of Rule 1004 in view of the possible consequences to him of an order for relief against the entity alleged to include him as a member. See &sect;723 of the Code; <em>Francis v. McNeal</em>, 228 U.S. 695 (1913); <em>Manson v. Williams</em>, 213 U.S. 453 (1909); <em>Carter v. Whisler</em>, 275 Fed. 743, 746&ndash;747 (8th Cir. 1921). The rule preserves the features of the former Act and Rule 112 and the Code permitting no response by creditors to an involuntary petition or petition against a partnership under Rule 1004(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b):</em> Rule 12 F.R.Civ.P. has been looked to by the courts as prescribing the mode of making a defense or objection to a petition in bankruptcy. See <em>Fada of New York, Inc. v. Organization Service Co., Inc</em>., 125 F.2d 120. (2d Cir. 1942); <em>In the Matter of McDougald</em>, 17 F.R.D. 2, 5 (W.D. Ark. 1955); <em>In the Matter of Miller</em>, 6 Fed. Rules Serv. 12f.26, Case No. 1 (N.D. Ohio 1942); <em>Tatum v. Acadian Production Corp. of La</em>., 35 F. Supp. 40, 50 (E.D. La. 1940); 2 Collier, <em>supra</em> &nbsp;303.07 (15th ed. 1981); 2 <em>id</em>. at 134&ndash;40 (14th ed. 1966). As pointed out in the Note accompanying former Bankruptcy Rule 915 an objection that a debtor is neither entitled to the benefits of the Code nor amenable to an involuntary petition goes to jurisdiction of the subject matter and may be made at any time consistent with Rule 12(h)(3) F.R.Civ.P. Nothing in this rule recognizes standing in a creditor or any other person not authorized to contest a petition to raise an objection that a person eligible to file a voluntary petition cannot be the subject of an order for relief on an involuntary petition. See Seligson & King, <em>Jurisdiction and Venue in Bankruptcy</em>, 36 Ref.J. 36, 38&ndash;40 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">As Collier has pointed out with respect to the Bankruptcy Act, &ldquo;the mechanics of the provisions in &sect;18a and b relating to time for appearance and pleading are unnecessarily confusing. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It would seem, though, to be more straightforward to provide, as does Federal Rule 12(a), that the time to respond runs from the date of service rather than the date of issuance of process.&rdquo; 2 Collier, <em>supra</em> at 119. The time normally allowed for the service and filing of an answer or motion under Rule 1011 runs from the date of the issuance of the summons. Compare Rule 7012. Service of the summons and petition will ordinarily be made by mail under Rule 1010 and must be made within 10 days of the issuance of the summons under Rule 7004(e), which governs the time of service. When service is made by publication, the court should fix the time for service and filing of the response in the light of all the circumstances so as to afford a fair opportunity to the debtor to enter a defense or objection without unduly delaying the hearing on the petition. <em>Cf</em>. Rule 12(a) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:16 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c):</em> Under subdivision (c), the timely service of a motion permitted by Rule 12(b), (e), (f), or (h) F.R.Civ.P. alters the time within which an answer must be filed. If the court denies a motion or postpones its disposition until trial on the merits, the answer must be served within 10 days after notice of the court's action. If the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the answer may be served any time within 10 days after the service of the more definite statement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many of the rules governing adversary proceedings apply to proceedings on a contested petition unless the court otherwise directs as provided in Rule 1018. The specific provisions of this Rule 1011 or 7005, however, govern the filing of an answer or motion responsive to a petition. The rules of Part VII are adaptations of the corresponding Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the effect of Rule 1018 is thus to make the provisions of Civil Rules 5, 8, 9, 15, and 56, <em>inter alia</em>, generally applicable to the making of defenses and objections to the petition. Rule 1018 follows prior law and practice in this respect. See 2 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;18.39&ndash;18.41 (14th ed. 1966).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. This subdivision adopts the position taken in many cases that an affirmative judgment against a petitioning creditor cannot be sought by a counterclaim filed in an answer to an involuntary petition. See, <em>e.g., Georgia Jewelers, Inc. v. Bulova Watch Co</em>., 302 F.2d 362, 369&ndash;70 (5th Cir. 1962); <em>Associated Electronic Supply Co. of Omaha v. C.B.S. Electronic Sales Corp</em>., 288 F.2d 683, 684&ndash;85 (8th Cir. 1961). The subdivision follows <em>Harris v. Capehart-Farnsworth Corp</em>., 225 F.2d 268 (8th Cir. 1955), in permitting the debtor to challenge the standing of a petitioner by filing a counterclaim against him. It does not foreclose the court from rejecting a counterclaim that cannot be determined without unduly delaying the decision upon the petition. See <em>In the Matter of Bichel Optical Laboratories, Inc</em>., 299 F. Supp. 545 (D. Minn. 1969).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. This subdivision makes it clear that no reply needs to be made to an answer, including one asserting a counterclaim, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule has been broadened to make applicable in ancillary cases the provisions concerning responsive pleadings to involuntary petitions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 1004 that became effective on December 1, 2002, deleted former subdivision (a) of that rule leaving only the provisions relating to involuntary petitions against partnerships. The rule no longer includes subdivisions. Therefore, this technical amendment changes the reference to Rule 1004(b) to Rule 1004.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to reflect the 2005 amendments to the Code, which repealed &sect;304 and added chapter 15. Section 304 covered cases ancillary to foreign proceedings, while chapter 15 governs ancillary and other cross-border cases and introduces the concept of a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is also amended in tandem with the amendment to Rule 1010 to require the parties responding to an involuntary petition and a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding to file corporate ownership statements to assist the court in determining whether recusal is necessary.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116 which contained venue as well as transfer provisions. Public Law 95&ndash;598, however, placed the venue provisions in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1472, and no purpose is served by repeating them in this rule. Transfer of cases is provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1475 but this rule adds the procedure for obtaining transfer. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1472, proper venue for cases filed under the Code is either the district of domicile, residence, principal place of business, or location of principal assets for 180 days or the longer portion thereof immediately preceding the petition. 28 U.S.C. &sect;1475 permits the court to transfer a case in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties. If the venue is improper, the court may retain or transfer the case in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1477.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of the rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116(b). It implements 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1475 and 1477 and clarifies the procedure to be followed in requesting and effecting transfer of a case. Subdivision (a) protects the parties against being subjected to a transfer except on a timely motion of a party in interest. If the transfer would result in fragmentation or duplication of administration, increase expense, or delay closing the estate, such a factor would bear on the timeliness of the motion as well as on the propriety of the transfer under the standards prescribed in subdivision (a). Subdivision (a) of the rule requires the interest of justice and the convenience of the parties to be the grounds of any transfer of a case or of the retention of a case filed in an improper district as does 28 U.S.C. &sect;1477. <em>Cf</em>. 28 U.S.C. &sect;1404(a) (district court may transfer any civil action &ldquo;[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice&rdquo;). It also expressly requires a hearing on notice to the petitioner or petitioners before the transfer of any case may be ordered. Under this rule, a motion by a party in interest is necessary. There is no provision for the court to act on its own initiative.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 116(c). It authorizes the court in which the first petition is filed under the Code by or against a debtor to entertain a motion seeking a determination whether the case so commenced should continue or be transferred and consolidated or administered jointly with another case commenced by or against the same or related person in another court under a different chapter of the Code. Subdivision (b) is correlated with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1472 which authorizes petitioners to file cases involving a partnership and partners or affiliated debtors.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference in subdivision (b) to petitions filed &ldquo;by&rdquo; a partner or &ldquo;by&rdquo; any other of the persons mentioned is to be understood as referring to voluntary petitions. It is not the purpose of this subdivision to permit more than one case to be filed in the same court because a creditor signing an involuntary petition happens to be a partner, a partnership, or an affiliate of a debtor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Transfers of adversary proceedings in cases under title 11 are governed by Rule 7087 and 28 U.S.C. &sect;1475.</p>

<p class="note-body">Both paragraphs 1 and 2 of subdivision (a) are amended to conform to the standard for transfer in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1412. Formerly, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1477 authorized a court either to transfer or retain a case which had been commenced in a district where venue was improper. However, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1412, which supersedes 28 U.S.C. &sect;1477, authorizes only the transfer of a case. The rule is amended to delete the reference to retention of a case commenced in the improper district. Dismissal of a case commenced in the improper district as authorized by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1406 has been added to the rule. If a timely motion to dismiss for improper venue is not filed, the right to object to venue is waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of the rule has been deleted as unnecessary.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to provide that a motion for transfer of venue under this subdivision shall be filed in the district in which the first petition is pending. If the case commenced by the first petition has been transferred to another district prior to the filing of a motion to transfer a related case under this subdivision, the motion must be filed in the district to which the first petition had been transferred.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other amendments to this rule are consistent with the responsibilities of the United States trustee in the supervision and administration of cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3). The United States trustee may appear and be heard on issues relating to the transfer of the case or dismissal due to improper venue. See &sect;307 of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Cases Involving Same Debtor</cap-smallcap>. If two or more petitions by, regarding, or against the same debtor are pending in the same court, the court may order consolidation of the cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Cases Involving Two or More Related Debtors</cap-smallcap>. If a joint petition or two or more petitions are pending in the same court by or against (1) a husband and wife, or (2) a partnership and one or more of its general partners, or (3) two or more general partners, or (4) a debtor and an affiliate, the court may order a joint administration of the estates. Prior to entering an order the court shall give consideration to protecting creditors of different estates against potential conflicts of interest. An order directing joint administration of individual cases of a husband and wife shall, if one spouse has elected the exemptions under &sect;522(b)(2) of the Code and the other has elected the exemptions under &sect;522(b)(3), fix a reasonable time within which either may amend the election so that both shall have elected the same exemptions. The order shall notify the debtors that unless they elect the same exemptions within the time fixed by the court, they will be deemed to have elected the exemptions provided by &sect;522(b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Expediting and Protective Orders</cap-smallcap>. When an order for consolidation or joint administration of a joint case or two or more cases is entered pursuant to this rule, while protecting the rights of the parties under the Code, the court may enter orders as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs and delay.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 117(a). It applies to cases when the same debtor is named in both voluntary and involuntary petitions, when husband and wife have filed a joint petition pursuant to &sect;302 of the Code, and when two or more involuntary petitions are filed against the same debtor. It also applies when cases are pending in the same court by virtue of a transfer of one or more petitions from another court. Subdivision (c) allows the court discretion regarding the order of trial of issues raised by two or more involuntary petitions against the same debtor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> recognizes the propriety of joint administration of estates in certain kinds of cases. The election or appointment of one trustee for two or more jointly administered estates is authorized by Rule 2009. The authority of the court to order joint administration under subdivision (b) extends equally to the situation when the petitions are filed under different sections, <em>e.g</em>., when one petition is voluntary and the other involuntary, and when all of the petitions are filed under the same section of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Consolidation of cases implies a unitary administration of the estate and will ordinarily be indicated under the circumstances to which subdivision (a) applies. This rule does not deal with the consolidation of cases involving two or more separate debtors. Consolidation of the estates of separate debtors may sometimes be appropriate, as when the affairs of an individual and a corporation owned or controlled by that individual are so intermingled that the court cannot separate their assets and liabilities. Consolidation, as distinguished from joint administration, is neither authorized nor prohibited by this rule since the propriety of consolidation depends on substantive considerations and affects the substantive rights of the creditors of the different estates. For illustrations of the substantive consolidation of separate estates, see <em>Sampsell v. Imperial Paper & Color Corp</em>., 313 U.S. 215 (1941). See also <em>Chemical Bank N.Y. Trust Co. v. Kheel</em>, 369 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1966); Seligson & Mandell, <em>Multi-Debtor Petition&mdash;Consolidation of Debtors and Due Process of Law</em>, 73 Com.L.J. 341 (1968); Kennedy, <em>Insolvency and the Corporate Veil in the United States</em> in <em>Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Comparative Law</em> 232, 248&ndash;55 (1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Joint administration as distinguished from consolidation may include combining the estates by using a single docket for the matters occurring in the administration, including the listing of filed claims, the combining of notices to creditors of the different estates, and the joint handling of other purely administrative matters that may aid in expediting the cases and rendering the process less costly.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is an adaptation of the provisions of Rule 42(a) F.R.Civ.P. for the purposes of administration of estates under this rule. The rule does not deal with filing fees when an order for the consolidation of cases or joint administration of estates is made.</p>
<p class="note-body">A joint petition of husband and wife, requiring the payment of a single filing fee, is permitted by &sect;302 of the Code. Consolidation of such a case, however, rests in the discretion of the court; see &sect;302(b) of the Code.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to conform to the change in the numbering of &sect;522(b) of the Code that was made as a part of the 2005 amendments. Former subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of &sect;522 were renumbered as subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3), respectively. The rule is amended to make the parallel change.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. By amending subdivision (a) to include cases regarding the same debtor, the rule explicitly recognizes that the court's authority to consolidate cases when more than one petition is filed includes the authority to consolidate cases when one or more of the petitions is filed under chapter 15. This amendment is made in conjunction with the amendment to Rule 1014(b), which also governs petitions filed under chapter 15 regarding the same debtor as well as those filed by or against the debtor.</p>

Except as provided in &sect;&sect;707(a)(3), 707(b), 1208(b), and 1307(b) of the Code, and in Rule 1017(b), (c), and (e), a case shall not be dismissed on motion of the petitioner, for want of prosecution or other cause, or by consent of the parties, before a hearing on notice as provided in Rule 2002. For the purpose of the notice, the debtor shall file a list of creditors with their addresses within the time fixed by the court unless the list was previously filed.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Dismissal for Failure To Pay Filing Fee</cap-smallcap>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If any installment of the filing fee has not been paid, the court may, after a hearing on notice to the debtor and the trustee, dismiss the case.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Suspension</cap-smallcap>. The court shall not dismiss a case or suspend proceedings under &sect;305 before a hearing on notice as provided in Rule 2002(a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except as otherwise provided in &sect;704(b)(2), a motion to dismiss a case for abuse under &sect;707(b) or (c) may be filed only within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under &sect;341(a), unless, on request filed before the time has expired, the court for cause extends the time for filing the motion to dismiss. The party filing the motion shall set forth in the motion all matters to be considered at the hearing. In addition, a motion to dismiss under &sect;707(b)(1) and (3) shall state with particularity the circumstances alleged to constitute abuse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the hearing is set on the court's own motion, notice of the hearing shall be served on the debtor no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under &sect;341(a).

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(a). While the rule applies to voluntary and involuntary cases, the &ldquo;consent of the parties&rdquo; referred to is that of petitioning creditors and the debtor in an involuntary case. The last sentence recognizes that the court should not be confined to petitioning creditors in its choice of parties on whom to call for assistance in preparing the list of creditors when the debtor fails to do so. This subdivision implements &sect;&sect;303(j), 707, 1112 and 1307 of the Code by specifying the manner of and persons to whom notice shall be given and requiring the court to hold a hearing on the issue of dismissal.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(b). A dismissal under this subdivision can occur only when the petition has been permitted to be filed pursuant to Rule 1006(b). The provision for notice in paragraph (3) is correlated with the provision in Rule 4006 when there is a waiver, denial, or revocation of a discharge. As pointed out in the Note accompanying Rule 4008, the purpose of notifying creditors of a debtor that no discharge has been granted is to correct their assumption to the contrary so that they can take appropriate steps to protect their claims.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is new and specifies the notice required for a hearing on dismissal or suspension pursuant to &sect;305 of the Code. The suspension to which this subdivision refers is that of the case; it does not concern abstention of the court in hearing an adversary proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1478(b).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:20 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Any proceeding, whether by a debtor or other party, to dismiss or convert a case under &sect;&sect;706, 707, 1112, or 1307 is commenced by a motion pursuant to Rule 9014.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to provide that dismissal or conversion pursuant to &sect;&sect;706(a), 707(b), 1112(a), and 1307(b) is not automatically a contested matter under Rule 9014. Conversion or dismissal under these sections is initiated by the filing and serving of a motion as required by Rule 9013. No hearing is required on these motions unless the court directs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case as authorized by &sect;1307(a) is accomplished by the filing of a notice of conversion. The notice of conversion procedure is modeled on the voluntary dismissal provision of Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. Conversion occurs on the filing of the notice. No court order is required.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is new and provides the procedure to be followed when a court on its own motion has made a preliminary determination that an individual debtor's chapter 7 case may be dismissed pursuant to &sect;707(b) of the Code, which was added by the 1984 amendments. A debtor's failure to attend the hearing is not a ground for dismissal pursuant to &sect;707(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to clarify that all entities required to receive notice under Rule 2002, including but not limited to creditors, are entitled to the 20 day notice of the hearing to dismiss the case. The United States trustee receives the notice pursuant to Rule 2002(k).</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;petition&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;case&rdquo; in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) to conform to &sect;&sect;707, 930, 1112, 1208, and 1307.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to conform to &sect;348(c) of the Code which refers to the &ldquo;conversion order.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (d)</em> are amended to provide procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12 case. Procedures for dismissal or conversion under &sect;1208(a) and (b) are the same as the procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 13 case under &sect;1307(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment to &sect;707(b) of the Code which permits the United States trustee to make a motion to dismiss a case for substantial abuse. The time limit for such a motion is added by this subdivision. In general, the facts that are the basis for a motion to dismiss under &sect;707(b) exist at the time the case is commenced and usually can be discovered early in the case by reviewing the debtor's schedules and examining the debtor at the meeting of creditors. Since dismissal for substantial abuse has the effect of denying the debtor a discharge in the chapter 7 case based on matters which may be discovered early, a motion to dismiss under &sect;707(b) is analogous to an objection to discharge pursuant to Rule 4004 and, therefore, should be required to be made within a specified time period. If matters relating to substantial abuse are not discovered within the time period specified in subdivision (e) because of the debtor's false testimony, refusal to obey a court order, fraudulent schedules or other fraud, and the debtor receives a discharge, the debtor's conduct may constitute the basis for revocation of the discharge under &sect;727(d) and (e) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to clarify that the date of the filing of a notice of conversion in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case is treated as the date of the conversion order for the purpose of applying Rule 1019. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3)</em>, which provides that notice of dismissal for failure to pay the filing fee shall be sent to all creditors within 30 days after the dismissal, is deleted as unnecessary. Rule 2002(f) provides for notice to creditors of the dismissal of a case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 2002(a) and this rule currently require notice to all creditors of a hearing on dismissal of a voluntary chapter 7 case for the debtor's failure to file a list of creditors, schedules, and statement of financial affairs within the time provided in &sect;707(a)(3) of the Code. A new subdivision (c) is added to provide that the United States trustee, who is the only entity with standing to file a motion to dismiss under &sect;707(a)(3) or &sect;1307(c)(9), is required to serve the motion on only the debtor, the trustee, and any other entities as the court directs. This amendment, and the amendment to Rule 2002, will have the effect of avoiding the expense of sending notices of the motion to all creditors in a chapter 7 case.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (f) is the same as current subdivision (d), except that it provides that a motion to suspend all proceedings in a case or to dismiss a case for substantial abuse of chapter 7 under &sect;707(b) is governed by Rule 9014.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other amendments to this rule are stylistic or for clarification.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1017</em>. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes in Rule 1017(e) and (f).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely request filed by the United States trustee for an extension of time to file a motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case under &sect;707(b), whether the court rules on the request before or after the expiration of the 60-day period.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Reporter's Note on Text of Rule 1017(e)</em>. The above text of Rule 1017(e) is not based on the text of the rule in effect on this date. The above text embodies amendments that have been promulgated by the Supreme Court in April 1999 and, unless Congress acts with respect to the amendments, will become effective on December 1, 1999.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1017(e)</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) is amended to implement the 2005 amendments to &sect;707 of the Code. These statutory amendments permit conversion of a chapter 7 case to a case under chapter 11 or 13, change the basis for dismissal or conversion from &ldquo;substantial abuse&rdquo; to &ldquo;abuse,&rdquo; authorize parties other than the United States trustee to bring motions under &sect;707(b) under certain circumstances, and add &sect;707(c) to create an explicit ground for dismissal based on the request of a victim of a crime of violence or drug trafficking. The conforming amendments to subdivision (e) preserve the time limits already in place for &sect;707(b) motions, except to the extent that &sect;704(b)(2) sets the deadline for the United States trustee to act. In contrast to the grounds for a motion to dismiss under &sect;707(b)(2), which are quite specific, the grounds under &sect;707(b)(1) and (3) are very general. Therefore, to enable the debtor to respond, subdivision (e) requires that motions to dismiss under &sect;707(b)(1) and (3) state with particularity the circumstances alleged to constitute abuse.</p>

<p class="note-body">The rules in Part VII to which this rule refers are adaptations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the purpose of governing the procedure in adversary proceedings in cases under the Code. See the Note accompanying Rule 7001 <em>infra</em>. Because of the special need for dispatch and expedition in the determination of the issues in an involuntary petition, see <em>Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co</em>., 222 U.S. 300, 309 (1911), the objective of some of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and their adaptations in Part VII to facilitate the settlement of multiple controversies involving many persons in a single lawsuit is not compatible with the exigencies of bankruptcy administration. See <em>United States F. & G. Co. v. Bray</em>, 225 U.S. 205, 218 (1912). For that reason Rules 7013, 7014 and 7018&ndash;7023 will rarely be appropriate in a proceeding on a contested petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Certain terms used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have altered meanings when they are made applicable in cases under the Code by these rules. See Rule 9002 <em>infra</em>. This Rule 1018 requires that the terms &ldquo;adversary proceedings&rdquo; when used in the rules in Part VII and &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; when used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure be given altered meanings when they are made applicable to proceedings relating to a contested petition or proceedings to vacate any order for relief. A motion to vacate an order for relief, whether or not made on a petition that was or could have been contested, is governed by the rules in Part VII referred to in this Rule 1018.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 1018 is amended to include within its terms a petition commencing an ancillary case when it is contested. This provision was formerly included in Rule 1003(e)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although this rule does not contain an explicit authorization for the entry of an order for relief when a debtor refuses to cooperate in discovery relating to a contested involuntary petition, the court has ample power under Rule 37(b) F.R.Civ.P., as incorporated by Rule 7037, to enter an order for relief under appropriate circumstances. Rule 37(b) authorizes the court to enter judgment by default or an order that &ldquo;facts shall be taken as established.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2010 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to reflect the enactment of chapter 15 of the Code in 2005. As to chapter 15 cases, the rule applies to contests over the petition for recognition and not to all matters that arise in the case. Thus, proceedings governed by &sect;1519(e) and &sect;1521(e) of the Code must comply with Rules 7001(7) and 7065, which provide that actions for injunctive relief are adversary proceedings governed by Part VII of the rules. The rule is also amended to clarify that it applies to contests over an involuntary petition, and not to matters merely &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; a contested involuntary petition. Matters that may arise in a chapter 15 case or an involuntary case, other than contests over the petition itself, are governed by the otherwise applicable rules.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">When a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case has been converted or reconverted to a chapter 7 case:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Filing of Lists, Inventories, Schedules, Statements.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Lists, inventories, schedules, and statements of financial affairs theretofore filed shall be deemed to be filed in the chapter 7 case, unless the court directs otherwise. If they have not been previously filed, the debtor shall comply with Rule 1007 as if an order for relief had been entered on an involuntary petition on the date of the entry of the order directing that the case continue under chapter 7.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If a statement of intention is required, it shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the order of conversion or before the first date set for the meeting of creditors, whichever is earlier. The court may grant an extension of time for cause only on written motion filed, or oral request made during a hearing, before the time has expired. Notice of an extension shall be given to the United States trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as the court may direct.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>New Filing Periods.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A new time period for filing a motion under &sect;707(b) or (c), a claim, a complaint objecting to discharge, or a complaint to obtain a determination of dischargeability of any debt shall commence under Rules&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_1019_1_target" name="Rule_1019_1">1</a></sup> 1017, 3002, 4004, or 4007, but a new time period shall not commence if a chapter 7 case had been converted to a chapter 11, 12, or 13 case and thereafter reconverted to a chapter 7 case and the time for filing a motion under &sect;707(b) or (c), a claim, a complaint objecting to discharge, or a complaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of any debt, or any extension thereof, expired in the original chapter 7 case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A new time period for filing an objection to a claim of exemptions shall commence under Rule 4003(b) after conversion of a case to chapter 7 unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the case was converted to chapter 7 more than one year after the entry of the first order confirming a plan under chapter 11, 12, or 13; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the case was previously pending in chapter 7 and the time to object to a claimed exemption had expired in the original chapter 7 case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:22 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Claims Filed Before Conversion</em>. All claims actually filed by a creditor before conversion of the case are deemed filed in the chapter 7 case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Turnover of Records and Property</em>. After qualification of, or assumption of duties by the chapter 7 trustee, any debtor in possession or trustee previously acting in the chapter 11, 12, or 13 case shall, forthwith, unless otherwise ordered, turn over to the chapter 7 trustee all records and property of the estate in the possession or control of the debtor in possession or trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Filing Final Report and Schedule of Postpetition Debts.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Conversion of Chapter 11 or Chapter 12 Case</em>.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) not later than 14 days after conversion of the case, file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred after the filing of the petition and before conversion of the case, including the name and address of each holder of a claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not later than 30 days after conversion of the case, file and transmit to the United States trustee a final report and account;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Conversion of Chapter 13 Case</em>. Unless the court directs otherwise, if a chapter 13 case is converted to chapter 7,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the debtor, not later than 14 days after conversion of the case, shall file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred after the filing of the petition and before conversion of the case, including the name and address of each holder of a claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the trustee, not later than 30 days after conversion of the case, shall file and transmit to the United States trustee a final report and account;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Conversion After Confirmation of a Plan</em>. Unless the court orders otherwise, if a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case is converted to chapter 7 after confirmation of a plan, the debtor shall file:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a schedule of property not listed in the final report and account acquired after the filing of the petition but before conversion, except if the case is converted from chapter 13 to chapter 7 and &sect;348(f)(2) does not apply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a schedule of unpaid debts not listed in the final report and account incurred after confirmation but before the conversion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases entered into or assumed after the filing of the petition but before conversion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Transmission to United States Trustee</em>. The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every schedule filed pursuant to Rule 1019(5).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Postpetition Claims; Preconversion Administrative Expenses; Notice</em>. A request for payment of an administrative expense incurred before conversion of the case is timely filed under &sect;503(a) of the Code if it is filed before conversion or a time fixed by the court. If the request is filed by a governmental unit, it is timely if it is filed before conversion or within the later of a time fixed by the court or 180 days after the date of the conversion. A claim of a kind specified in &sect;348(d) may be filed in accordance with Rules 3001(a)&ndash;(d) and 3002. Upon the filing of the schedule of unpaid debts incurred after commencement of the case and before conversion, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give notice to those entities listed on the schedule of the time for filing a request for payment of an administrative expense and, unless a notice of insufficient assets to pay a dividend is mailed in accordance with Rule 2002(e), the time for filing a claim of a kind specified in &sect;348(d).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 122 and implements &sect;348 of the Code. The rule applies to proceedings in a chapter 7 case following supersession of a case commenced under chapter 11 or 13, whether the latter was initiated by an original petition or was converted from a pending chapter 7 or another chapter case. The rule is not intended to invalidate any action taken in the superseded case before its conversion to chapter 7.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1):</em> If requirements applicable in the superseded case respecting the filing of schedules of debts and property, or lists of creditors and inventory, and of statements of financial affairs have been complied with before the order directing conversion to liquidation, these documents will ordinarily provide all the information about the debts, property, financial affairs, and contracts of the debtor needed for the administration of the estate. If the information submitted in the superseded case is inadequate for the purposes of administration, however, the court may direct the preparation of further informational material and the manner and time of its submission pursuant to paragraph (1). If no schedules, lists, inventories, or statements were filed in the superseded case, this paragraph imposes the duty on the debtor to file schedules and a statement of affairs pursuant to Rule 1007 as if an involuntary petition had been filed on the date when the court directed the conversion of the case to a liquidation case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraphs (2) and (3)</em>. Paragraph (2) requires notice to be given to all creditors of the order of conversion. The notice is to be included in the notice of the meeting of creditors and Official Form No. 16 may be adapted for use. A meeting of creditors may have been held in the superseded case as required by &sect;341(a) of the Code but that would not dispense with the need to hold one in the ensuing liquidation case. Section 701(a) of the Code permits the court to appoint the trustee acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case as interim trustee in the chapter 7 case. Section 702(a) of the Code allows creditors to elect a trustee but only at the meeting of creditors held under &sect;341. The right to elect a trustee is not lost because the chapter 7 case follows a chapter 11 or 13 case. Thus a meeting of creditors is necessary. The date fixed for the meeting of creditors will control at least the time for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c). That time will remain applicable in the ensuing chapter 7 case except as paragraph (3) provides, if that time had expired in an earlier chapter 7 case which was con<!-- PDFPage:23 -->verted to the chapter 11 or 13 case, it is not revived in the subsequent chapter 7 case. The same is true if the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge or to determine nondischargeability of a debt had expired. Paragraph (3), however, recognizes that such time may be extended by the court under Rule 4004 or 4007 on motion made within the original prescribed time.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em> renders it unnecessary to file anew claims that had been filed in the chapter 11 or 13 case before conversion to chapter 7.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (5)</em> contemplates that typically, after the court orders conversion of a chapter case to liquidation, a trustee under chapter 7 will forthwith take charge of the property of the estate and proceed expeditiously to liquidate it. The court may appoint the interim trustee in the chapter 7 case pursuant to &sect;701(a) of the Code. If creditors do not elect a trustee under &sect;702, the interim trustee becomes the trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em> requires the trustee or debtor in possession acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case to file a final report and schedule of debts incurred in that case. This schedule will provide the information necessary for giving the notice required by paragraph (7) of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (7)</em> requires that claims that arose in the chapter 11 or 13 case be filed within 60 days after entry of the order converting the case to one under chapter 7. Claims not scheduled pursuant to paragraph (6) of the rule or arising from the rejection of an executory contract entered into during the chapter case may be filed within a time fixed by the court. Pursuant to &sect;348(c) of the Code, the conversion order is treated as the order for relief to fix the time for the trustee to assume or reject executory contracts under &sect;365(d).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (8)</em> permits the extension of the time for filing claims when claims are not timely filed but only with respect to any surplus that may remain in the estate. See also &sect;726(a)(2)(C) and (3) of the Code.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em> is amended to provide for the filing of a statement of intention in a case converted to chapter 7. Paragraph (1)(B) is added to provide for the filing of the statement of intention when a case is converted to chapter 7. The time for filing the statement of intention and for an extension of that time is governed by &sect;521(2)(A) of the Code. An extension of time for other required filings is governed by Rule 1007(c), which paragraph (1)(A) incorporates by reference. Because of the amendment to Rule 1007(c), the filing of new lists, schedules, and statements is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3)</em> of the rule is expanded to include the effect of conversion of a chapter 11 or 13 case to a chapter 7 case. On conversion of a case from chapter 11 or 13 to a chapter 7 case, parties have a new period within which to file claims or complaints relating to the granting of the discharge or the dischargeability of a debt. This amendment is consistent with the holding and reasoning of the court in <em>F & M Marquette Nat'l Bank v. Richards</em>, 780 F.2d 24 (8th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em> is amended to deal directly with the status of claims which are properly listed on the schedules filed in a chapter 11 case and deemed filed pursuant to &sect;1111(a) of the Code. Section 1111(a) is only applicable to the chapter 11 case. On conversion of the chapter 11 case to a chapter 7 case, paragraph (4) governs the status of claims filed in the chapter 11 case. The Third Circuit properly construed paragraph (4) as applicable to claims deemed filed in the superseded chapter 11 case. <em>In re Crouthamel Potato Chip Co</em>., 786 F.2d 141 (3d Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to paragraph (4) changes that result by providing that only claims that are actually filed in the chapter 11 case are treated as filed in the superseding chapter 7 case. When chapter 11 cases are converted to chapter 7 cases, difficulties in obtaining and verifying the debtors&rsquo; records are common. It is unfair to the chapter 7 trustee and creditors to require that they be bound by schedules which may not be subject to verification.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em> is amended to place the obligation on the chapter 13 debtor to file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred during the superseded chapter 13 case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to include conversion of a case from chapter 12 to chapter 7 and to implement the United States trustee system.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to paragraph (1)(A) are stylistic. Reference to the statement of executory contracts is deleted to conform to the amendment to Rule 1007(b)(1) which changes the statement to a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)(B)</em> is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case and to take appropriate action to enforce the debtor's obligation to perform the statement of intention in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em> is deleted because notice of conversion of the case is required by Rules 1017(d), 2002(f)(2), and 9022. The United States trustee, who supervises trustees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a), may give notice of the conversion to the trustee in the superseded case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em>, renumbered as paragraph (5), is amended to reduce to 15 days the time for filing a schedule of postpetition debts and requires inclusion of the name and address of each creditor in connection with the postpetition debt. These changes will enable the clerk to send postpetition creditors a timely notice of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to &sect;341(a) of the Code. The amendments to this paragraph also provide the United States trustee with the final report and account of the superseded case, and with a copy of every schedule filed after conversion of the case. Conversion to chapter 7 terminates the service of the trustee in the superseded case pursuant to &sect;348(e) of the Code. Sections 704(a)(9), 1106(a)(1), 1107(a), 1202(b)(1), 1203 and 1302(b)(1) of the Code require the trustee or debtor in possession to file a final report and account with the court and the United States trustee. The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (7)</em>, renumbered as paragraph (6), is amended to conform the time for filing postpetition claims to the time for filing prepetition claims pursuant to paragraph (3) (renumbered as paragraph (2)) of this rule and Rule 3002(c). This paragraph is also amended to eliminate the need for a court order to provide notice of the time for filing claims. It is anticipated that this notice will be given together with the notice of the meeting of creditors. It is amended further to avoid the need to fix a time for filing claims arising under &sect;365(d) if it is a no asset case upon conversion. If assets become available for distribution, the court may fix a time for filing such claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">The additions of references to unexpired leases in paragraph (1)(A) and in paragraphs (6) and (7) (renumbered as paragraphs (5) and (6)) are technical amendments to clarify that unexpired leases are included as well as other executory contracts.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (7)</em> is abrogated to conform to the abrogation of Rule 3002(c)(6).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1019</em>. No changes were made to the text of the rule. The Committee Note was changed to conform to the proposed changes to Rule 3002 (see GAP Report on Rule 3002 below).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to subdivisions (3) and (5) are technical corrections and stylistic changes. The phrase &ldquo;superseded case&rdquo; is deleted because it creates the erroneous impression that conversion of a case results in a new case that is distinct from the original case. Similarly, the phrase &ldquo;original petition&rdquo; is deleted because <!-- PDFPage:24 -->it erroneously implies that there is a second petition with respect to a converted case. See &sect;348 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1019</em>. No changes to the published draft.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)(B)</em> is amended to clarify that a motion for an extension of time to file a statement of intention must be made by written motion filed before the time expires, or by oral request made at a hearing before the time expires.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (6)</em> is amended to provide that a holder of an administrative expense claim incurred after the commencement of the case, but before conversion to chapter 7, is required to file a request for payment under &sect;503(a) within a time fixed by the court, rather than a proof of claim under &sect;501 and Rules 3001(a)&ndash;(d) and 3002. The 180-day period applicable to governmental units is intended to conform to &sect;502(b)(9) of the Code and Rule 3002(c)(1). It is unnecessary for the court to fix a time for filing requests for payment if it appears that there are not sufficient assets to pay preconversion administrative expenses. If a time for filing a request for payment of an administrative expense is fixed by the court, it may be enlarged as provided in Rule 9006(b). If an administrative expense claimant fails to timely file the request, it may be tardily filed under &sect;503(a) if permitted by the court for cause.</p>
<p class="note-body">The final sentence of Rule 1019(6) is deleted because it is unnecessary in view of the other amendments to this paragraph. If a party has entered into a postpetition contract or lease with the trustee or debtor that constitutes an administrative expense, a timely request for payment must be filed in accordance with this paragraph and &sect;503(b) of the Code. The time for filing a proof of claim in connection with the rejection of any other executory contract or unexpired lease is governed by Rule 3002(c)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;including the United States, any state, or any subdivision thereof&rdquo; is deleted as unnecessary. Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1019</em>. The proposed amendments to Rule 1019(6) were changed to delete the deadline for filing requests for payment of preconversion administrative expenses that would be applicable in all cases, and to provide instead that the court may fix such a deadline. The committee note was revised to clarify that it is not necessary for the court to fix a deadline where there are insufficient assets to pay preconversion administrative expenses.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (2) is amended to include a new filing period for motions under &sect;707(b) and (c) of the Code when a case is converted to chapter 7. The establishment of a deadline for filing such motions is not intended to express a position as to whether such motions are permitted under the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. The Committee Note was amended by adding the second sentence to the Note stating explicitly that the rule was not intended to take a position on whether motions to dismiss a case under &sect;707(b) and (c) are proper in a case that is converted from another chapter.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;15-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;20-day periods become 21-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;25-day periods become 28-day periods</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2010 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (2)</em>. Subdivision (2) is redesignated as subdivision (2)(A), and a new subdivision (2)(B) is added to the rule. Subdivision (2)(B) provides that a new time period to object to a claim of exemption arises when a case is converted to chapter 7 from chapter 11, 12, or 13. The new time period does not arise, however, if the conversion occurs more than one year after the first order confirming a plan, even if the plan was subsequently modified. A new objection period also does not arise if the case was previously pending under chapter 7 and the objection period had expired in the prior chapter 7 case.</p>

Except as provided in subdivision (c), the status of the case as a small business case shall be in accordance with the debtor's statement under this subdivision, unless and until the court enters an order finding that the debtor's statement is incorrect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Objecting to Designation</cap-smallcap>. Except as provided in subdivision (c), the United States trustee or a party in interest may file an objection to the debtor's statement under subdivision (a) no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held under &sect;341(a) of the Code, or within 30 days after any amendment to the statement, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of Committee of Unsecured Creditors</cap-smallcap>. If a committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under &sect;1102(a)(1), the case shall proceed as a small business case only if, and from the time when, the court enters an order determining that the committee has not been sufficiently active and representative to provide effective oversight of the debtor and that the debtor satisfies all the other requirements for being a small business. A request for a determination under this subdivision may be filed by the United States trustee or a party in interest only within a reasonable time after the failure of the committee to be sufficiently active and representative. The debtor may file a request for a determination at any time as to whether the committee has been sufficiently active and representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Procedure for Objection or Determination</cap-smallcap>. Any objection or request for a determination under this rule shall be governed by Rule 9014 and served on: the debtor; the debtor's attorney; the United States trustee; the trustee; any committee appointed under &sect;1102 or its authorized agent, or, if no committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under &sect;1102, the creditors included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and any other entity as the court directs.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is designed to implement &sect;&sect;1121(e) and 1125(f) that were added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:25 --><p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1020</em>. The phrase &ldquo;or by a later date as the court, for cause, may fix&rdquo; at the end of the published draft was deleted. The general provisions on reducing or extending time periods under Rule 9006 will be applicable.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the Code, as amended in 2005, there are no longer any provisions permitting or requiring a small business debtor to elect to be treated as a small business. Therefore, the election provisions in the rule are eliminated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The 2005 amendments to the Code include several provisions relating to small business cases under chapter 11. Section 101 includes definitions of &ldquo;small business debtor&rdquo; and &ldquo;small business case.&rdquo; The purpose of the new language in this rule is to provide a procedure for informing the parties, the United States trustee, and the court of whether the debtor is a small business debtor, and to provide procedures for resolving disputes regarding the proper characterization of the debtor. Because it is important to resolve such disputes early in the case, a time limit for objecting to the debtor's self-designation is imposed. Rule 9006(b)(1), which governs enlargement of time, is applicable to the time limits set forth in this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">An important factor in determining whether the debtor is a small business debtor is whether the United States trustee has appointed a committee of unsecured creditors under &sect;1102, and whether such a committee is sufficiently active and representative. Subdivision (c), relating to the appointment and activity of a committee of unsecured creditors, is designed to be consistent with the Code's definition of &ldquo;small business debtor.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>

The rule also provides procedures for resolving disputes regarding the status of the debtor as a health care business.</p>
