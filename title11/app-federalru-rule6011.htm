<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is new. It implements &sect;351(1), which was added to the Code by the 2005 amendments. That provision requires the trustee to notify patients that their patient records will be destroyed if they remain unclaimed for one year after the publication of a notice in an appropriate newspaper. The Code provision also requires that individualized notice be sent to each patient and to the patient's family member or other contact person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The variety of health care businesses and the range of current and former patients present the need for flexibility in the creation and publication of the notices that will be given. Nevertheless, there are some matters that must be included in any notice being given to patients, their family members, and contact persons to ensure that sufficient information is provided to these persons regarding the trustee's intent to dispose of patient records. Subdivision (a) of this rule lists the minimum requirements for notices given under &sect;351(1)(A), and subdivision (b) governs the form of notices under &sect;351(1)(B). Notices given under this rule are subject to provisions under applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of patients&rsquo; privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104&ndash;191 (HIPAA).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) directs the trustee to maintain proof of compliance with &sect;351(1)(B), but because the proof of compliance may contain patient names that should or must remain confidential, it prohibits filing the proof of compliance unless the court orders the trustee to file it under seal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) requires the trustee to file a report with the court regarding the destruction of patient records. This certification is intended to ensure that the trustee properly completed the destruction process. However, because the report will be filed with the court and ordinarily will be available to the public under &sect;107, the names, addresses, and other identifying information of patients are not to be included in the report to protect patient privacy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. Subdivision (b)(2) was amended to add the Attorney General of the State where a health care facility is located to the list of entities entitled to notice of the disposal of patient records.</p>
