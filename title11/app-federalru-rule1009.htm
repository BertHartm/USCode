<h3 class="section-head">Rule 1009. Amendments of Voluntary Petitions, Lists, Schedules and Statements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General Right To Amend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A voluntary petition, list, schedule, or statement may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed. The debtor shall give notice of the amendment to the trustee and to any entity affected thereby. On motion of a party in interest, after notice and a hearing, the court may order any voluntary petition, list, schedule, or statement to be amended and the clerk shall give notice of the amendment to entities designated by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of Intention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The statement of intention may be amended by the debtor at any time before the expiration of the period provided in &sect;521(2)(B) of the Code. The debtor shall give notice of the amendment to the trustee and to any entity affected thereby.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transmission to United States Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every amendment filed pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of this rule.</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:sourcecredit -->
<p class="source-credit">(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule continues the permissive approach adopted by former Bankruptcy Rule 110 to amendments of voluntary petitions and accompanying papers. Notice of any amendment is required to be given to the trustee. This is particularly important with respect to any amendment of the schedule of property affecting the debtor's claim of exemptions. Notice of any amendment of the schedule of liabilities is to be given to any creditor whose claim is changed or newly listed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule does not continue the provision permitting the court to order an amendment on its own initiative. Absent a request in some form by a party in interest, the court should not be involved in administrative matters affecting the estate.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a list or schedule is amended to include an additional creditor, the effect on the dischargeability of the creditor's claim is governed by the provisions of &sect;523(a)(3) of the Code.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to require notice and a hearing in the event a party in interest other than the debtor seeks to amend. The number of copies of the amendment will be determined by local rule of court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is added to treat amendments of the statement of intention separately from other amendments. The intention of the individual debtor must be performed within 45 days of the filing of the statement, unless the court extends the period. Subdivision (b) limits the time for amendment to the time for performance under &sect;521(2)(B) of the Code or any extension granted by the court.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to subdivision (a) are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is derived from Rule X&ndash;1002(a) and is designed to provide the United States trustee with current information to enable that office to participate effectively in the case.</p>
