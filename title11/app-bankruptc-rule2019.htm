<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is a comprehensive regulation of representation in chapter 9 municipality and in chapter 11 reorganization cases. It is derived from &sect;&sect;209&ndash;213 of the Act and former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;211.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from &sect;&sect;212, 213 of the Act. As used in clause (2), &ldquo;other authorization&rdquo; would include a power or warrant of attorney which are specifically mentioned in &sect;212 of the Act. This rule deals with representation provisions in mortgages, trust deeds, etc. to protect the beneficiaries from unfair practices and the like. It does not deal with the validation or invalidation of security interests generally. If immediate compliance is not possible, the court may permit a representative to be heard on a specific matter, but there is no implicit waiver of compliance on a permanent basis.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
