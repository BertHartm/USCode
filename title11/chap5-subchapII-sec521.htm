<p class="note-body">This section lists three duties of the debtor in a bankruptcy case. The Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure <!-- PDFPage:95 -->will specify the means of carrying out these duties. The first duty is to file with the court a list of creditors and, unless the court orders otherwise, a schedule of assets and liabilities and a statement of his financial affairs. Second, the debtor is required to cooperate with the trustee as necessary to enable the trustee to perform the trustee's duties. Finally, the debtor must surrender to the trustee all property of the estate, and any recorded information, including books, documents, records, and papers, relating to property of the estate. This phrase &ldquo;recorded information, including books, documents, records, and papers,&rdquo; has been used here and throughout the bill as a more general term, and includes such other forms of recorded information as&nbsp; data&nbsp; in&nbsp; computer&nbsp; storage&nbsp; or&nbsp; in&nbsp; other&nbsp; machine readable forms.</p>
<p class="note-body">The list in this section is not exhaustive of the debtor's duties. Others are listed elsewhere in proposed title 11, such as in section 343, which requires the debtor to submit to examination, or in the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, as continued by &sect;404(a) of S. 2266, such as the duty to attend any hearing on discharge, Rule 402(2).</p>
