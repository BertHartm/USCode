<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Transferor or Transferee of Claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A transferor or transferee of a claim shall annex to the original and each copy of the petition a copy of all documents evidencing the transfer, whether transferred unconditionally, for security, or otherwise, and a signed statement that the claim was not transferred for the purpose of commencing the case and setting forth the consideration for and terms of the transfer. An entity that has transferred or acquired a claim for the purpose of commencing a case for liquidation under chapter 7 or for reorganization under chapter 11 shall not be a qualified petitioner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Joinder of Petitioners After Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the answer to an involuntary petition filed by fewer than three creditors avers the existence of 12 or more creditors, the debtor shall file with the answer a list of all creditors with their addresses, a brief statement of the nature of their claims, and the amounts thereof. If it appears that there are 12 or more creditors as provided in &sect;303(b) of the Code, the court shall afford a reasonable opportunity for other creditors to join in the petition before a hearing is held thereon.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Official Form No. 11 (Involuntary Case: Creditors&rsquo; Petition), is prescribed for use by petitioning creditors to have a debtor's assets liquidated under chapter 7 of the Code or the business reorganized under chapter 11. It contains the required allegations as specified in &sect;303(b) of the Code. Official Form 12 is prescribed for use by fewer than all the general partners to obtain relief for the partnership as governed by &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code and Rule 1004(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the number of copies to be filed is specified in Rule 1002, a local rule may require additional copies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Only the original need be signed and verified, but the copies must be conformed to the original. See Rules 1008 and 9011(c). The petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court. This provision implements &sect;303(b) which provides that an involuntary case is commenced by filing the petition with the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">As provided in &sect;362 of the Code, the filing of the petition acts as a stay of certain acts and proceedings against the debtor, the debtor's property and property of the estate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> retains the explicitness of former Bankruptcy Rule 104(d) that a transfer of a claim for the purpose of commencing a case under the Code is a ground for disqualification of a party to the transfer as a petitioner.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 303(b) &ldquo;is not intended to overrule Bankruptcy Rule 104(d), which places certain restrictions on the transfer of claims for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case.&rdquo; House Report No. 95&ndash;595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 322; Senate Report No. 95&ndash;989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978) 33.</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision requires disclosure of any transfer of the petitioner's claim as well as a transfer to the petitioner and applies to transfers for security as well as unconditional transfers, <em>Cf. In re 69th & Crandon Bldg. Corp</em>., 97 F.2d 392, 395 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 629 (1938), recognizing the right of a creditor to sign a bankruptcy petition notwithstanding a prior assignment of his claim for the purpose of security. This rule does not, however, qualify the requirement of &sect;303(b)(1) that a petitioning creditor must have a claim not contingent as to liability.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Section 303(c) of the Code permits a creditor to join in the petition at any time before the case is dismissed or relief is ordered. While this rule does not require the court to give all creditors notice of the petition, the list of creditors filed by the debtor affords a petitioner the information needed to enable him to give notice for the purpose of obtaining the co-petitioners required to make the petition sufficient. After a reasonable opportunity has been afforded other creditors to join in an involuntary petition, the hearing on the petition should be held without further delay.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. This subdivision implements &sect;304. A petition for relief under &sect;304 may only be filed by a foreign representative who is defined in &sect;101(20) generally as a representative of an estate in a foreign proceeding. The term &ldquo;foreign proceeding&rdquo; is defined in &sect;101(19).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 304(b) permits a petition filed thereunder to be contested by a party in interest. Subdivision (e)(2) therefore requires that the summons and petition be served on any person against whom the relief permitted by &sect;304(b) is sought as well as on any other party the court may direct.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rules applicable to the procedure when an involuntary petition is filed are made applicable generally when a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is commenced. These rules include Rule 1010 with respect to issuance and service of a summons, Rule 1011 concerning responsive pleadings and motions, and Rule 1018 which makes various rules in Part VII applicable in proceedings on contested petitions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The venue for a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding is provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1474.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The subject matter of subdivisions (a), (b), and (e) has been incorporated in Rules 1002, 1010, 1011, and 1018.</p>
