<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule prescribes the procedure to be followed when a party requests the court to determine dischargeability of a debt pursuant to &sect;523 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although a complaint that comes within &sect;523(c) must ordinarily be filed before determining whether the debtor will be discharged, the court need not determine the issues presented by the complaint filed under this rule until the question of discharge has been determined under Rule 4004. A complaint filed under this rule initiates an adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> does not contain a time limit for filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a type of debt listed as nondischargeable under &sect;523(a)(1), (3), (5), (7), (8), or (9). Jurisdiction over this issue on these debts is held concurrently by the bankruptcy court and any appropriate nonbankruptcy forum.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> differs from subdivision (b) by imposing a deadline for filing complaints to determine the issue of dischargeability of debts set out in &sect;523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of the Code. The bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine dischargeability of these debts. If a complaint is not timely filed, the debt is discharged. See &sect;523(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The complaint required by this subdivision should be filed in the court in which the case is pending pursuant to Rule 5005.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to delete the words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to apply in chapter 12 cases the same time period that applies in chapter 7 and 11 cases for filing a complaint under &sect;523(c) of the Code to determine dischargeability of certain debts. Under &sect;1228(a) of the Code, a chapter 12 discharge does not discharge the debts specified in &sect;523(a) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to clarify that the deadline for filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt under &sect;523(c) of the Code is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors, whether or not the meeting is held on that date. The time for filing the complaint is not affected by any delay in the commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors. This amendment does not affect the right of any party in interest to file a motion for an extension of time to file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt in accordance with this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The substitution of the word &ldquo;filed&rdquo; for &ldquo;made&rdquo; in the final sentences of subdivisions (c) and (d) is intended to avoid confusion regarding the time when a motion is &ldquo;made&rdquo; for the purpose of applying these rules. <em>See, e.g., In re Coggin</em>, 30 F.3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, these subdivisions require that a motion for an extension of time be <em>filed</em> before the time has expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
