<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2007. Review of Appointment of Creditors&rsquo; Committee Organized Before Commencement of the Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Motion To Review Appointment</cap-smallcap>. If a committee appointed by the United States trustee pursuant to &sect;1102(a) of the Code consists of the members of a committee organized by creditors before the commencement of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case, on motion of a party in interest and after a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and other entities as the court may direct, the court may determine whether the appointment of the committee satisfies the requirements of &sect;1102(b)(1) of the Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Selection of Members of Committee</cap-smallcap>. The court may find that a committee organized by unsecured creditors before the commencement of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case was fairly chosen if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it was selected by a majority in number and amount of claims of unsecured creditors who may vote under &sect;702(a) of the Code and were present in person or represented at a meeting of which all creditors having unsecured claims of over $1,000 or the 100 unsecured creditors having the largest claims had at least seven days&rsquo; notice in writing, and of which meeting written minutes reporting the names of the creditors present or represented and voting and the amounts of their claims were kept and are available for inspection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) all proxies voted at the meeting for the elected committee were solicited pursuant to Rule 2006 and the lists and statements required by subdivision (e) thereof have been transmitted to the United States trustee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the organization of the committee was in all other respects fair and proper.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Failure To Comply With Requirements for Appointment</cap-smallcap>. After a hearing on notice pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule, the court shall direct the United States trustee to vacate the appointment of the committee and may order other appropriate action if the court finds that such appointment failed to satisfy the requirements of &sect;1102(b)(1) of the Code.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the court to appoint as the unsecured creditors&rsquo; committee, the committee that was selected by creditors before the order for relief. This provision recognizes the propriety of continuing a &ldquo;prepetition&rdquo; committee in an official capacity. Such a committee, however, must be found to have been fairly chosen and representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> does not necessarily require a hearing but does require a party in interest to bring to the court's attention the fact that a prepetition committee had been organized and should be appointed. An application would suffice for this purpose. Party in interest would include the committee, any member of the committee, or any of its agents acting for the committee. Whether or not notice of the application should be given to any other party is left to the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> implements &sect;1102(b)(1). The Code provision allows the court to appoint, as the official &sect;1102(a) committee, a &ldquo;prepetition&rdquo; committee if its members were fairly chosen and the committee is representative of the different kinds of claims. This subdivision of the rule indicates some of the factors the court may consider in determining whether the requirements of &sect;1102(b)(1) have been satisfied. In effect, the subdivision provides various factors which are similar to those set forth in Rule 2006 with respect to the solicitation and voting of proxies in a chapter 7 liquidation case.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to &sect;1102(b)(1) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to &sect;1102(a). The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to &sect;1102 in chapter 11 cases. Section 1102 is applicable in chapter 9 cases pursuant to &sect;901(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although &sect;1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the United States trustee to appoint a prepetition committee as the statutory committee if its members were fairly chosen and it is representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented, the amendment to this rule provides a procedure for judicial review of the appointment. The factors that may be considered by the court in determining whether the committee was fairly chosen are not new. A finding that a prepetition committee has not been fairly chosen does not prohibit the appointment of some or all of its members to the creditors&rsquo; committee. Although this rule deals only with judicial review of the appointment of prepetition committees, it does not preclude judicial review under Rule 2020 regarding the appointment of other committees.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;15-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;20-day periods become 21-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;25-day periods become 28-day periods</p>
