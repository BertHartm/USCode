<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 365(a) of the Code requires court approval for the assumption or rejection of an executory contract by the trustee or debtor in possession. The trustee or debtor in possession may also assign an executory contract, &sect;365(f)(1), but must first assume the contract, &sect;365(f)(2). Rule 6006 provides a procedure for obtaining court approval. It does not apply to the automatic rejection of contracts which are not assumed in chapter 7 liquidation cases within 60 days after the order for relief, or to the assumption or rejection of contracts in a plan pursuant to &sect;1123(b)(2) or &sect;1322(b)(7).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> by referring to Rule 9014 requires a motion to be brought for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of an executory contract. Normally, the motion will be brought by the trustee, debtor in possession or debtor in a chapter 9 or chapter 13 case. The authorization to assume a contract and to assign it may be sought in a single motion and determined by a single order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> makes applicable the same motion procedure when the other party to the contract seeks to require the chapter officer to take some action. Section 365(d)(2) recognizes that this procedure is available to <!-- PDFPage:68 -->these contractual parties. This provision of the Code and subdivision of the rule apply only in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases. A motion is not necessary in chapter 7 cases because in those cases a contract is deemed rejected if the trustee does not timely assume it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> provides for the court to set a hearing on a motion made under subdivision (a) or (b). The other party to the contract should be given appropriate notice of the hearing and the court may order that other parties in interest, such as a creditors&rsquo; committee, also be given notice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> are amended to conform to the 1984 amendment to &sect;365 of the Code, which governs assumption or rejection of time share interests.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1113, governing collective bargaining agreements, was added to the Code in 1984. It sets out requirements that must be met before a collective bargaining agreement may be rejected. The application to reject a collective bargaining agreement referred to in &sect;1113 shall be made by motion. The motion to reject creates a contested matter under Rule 9014, and service is made pursuant to Rule 7004 on the representative of the employees. The time periods set forth in &sect;1113(d) govern the scheduling of the hearing and disposition of a motion to reject the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">References to time share interests are deleted as unnecessary. Time share interests are within the scope of this rule to the extent that they are governed by &sect;365 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to include chapter 12 cases.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to enable the United States trustee to appear and be heard on the issues relating to the assumption or rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases. See &sect;&sect;307, 365, and 1113 of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to delete the requirement for an actual hearing when no request for a hearing is made. See Rule 9014.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order authorizing the assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease under &sect;365(f) of the Code before the assignment is consummated. The stay under subdivision (d) does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 6006(d) is not applicable so that the executory contract or unexpired lease may be assigned immediately in accordance with the order entered by the court. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule 6006(d) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.</p>
