<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2001. Appointment of Interim Trustee Before Order for Relief in a Chapter 7 Liquidation Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time following the commencement of an involuntary liquidation case and before an order for relief, the court on written motion of a party in interest may order the appointment of an interim trustee under &sect;303(g) of the Code. The motion shall set forth the necessity for the appointment and may be granted only after hearing on notice to the debtor, the petitioning creditors, the United States trustee, and other parties in interest as the court may designate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Bond of Movant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An interim trustee may not be appointed under this rule unless the movant furnishes a bond in an amount approved by the court, conditioned to indemnify the debtor for costs, attorney's fee, expenses, and damages allowable under &sect;303(i) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order of Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The order directing the appointment of an interim trustee shall state the reason the appointment is necessary and shall specify the trustee's duties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Turnover and Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Following qualification of the trustee selected under &sect;702 of the Code, the interim trustee, unless otherwise ordered, shall (1) forthwith deliver to the trustee all the records and property of the estate in possession or subject to control of the interim trustee and, (2) within 30 days thereafter file a final report and account.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 201. See also former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;201. In conformity with title 11 of the United States Code, this rule substitutes &ldquo;interim trustee&rdquo; for &ldquo;receiver.&rdquo; Subdivision (a) and (e) of Rule 201 are not included because the provisions contained therein are found in detail in &sect;303(g) of the Code, or they are inconsistent with &sect;701 of the Code. Similarly, the provisions in Rule 201(d) relating to a debtor's counterbond are not included because of their presence in &sect;303(g).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> makes it clear that the court may not on its own motion order the appointment of an interim trustee before an order for relief is entered. Appointment may be ordered only on motion of a party in interest.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> requires those seeking the appointment of an interim trustee to furnish a bond. The bond may be the same one required of petitioning creditors under &sect;303(e) of the Code to indemnify the debtor for damages allowed by the court under &sect;303(i).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> requires that the order specify which duties enumerated in &sect;303(g) shall be performed by the interim trustee. Reference should be made to Rule 2015 for additional duties required of an interim trustee including keeping records and filing periodic reports with the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> requires turnover of records and property to the trustee selected under &sect;702 of the Code, after qualification. That trustee may be the interim trustee who becomes the trustee because of the failure of creditors to elect one under &sect;702(d) or the trustee elected by creditors under &sect;702(b), (c).</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to conform to &sect;303(g) of the Code which provides that the United States trustee appoints the interim trustee. See Rule X&ndash;1003. This rule does not apply to the exercise by the court of the power to act sua sponte pursuant to &sect;105(a) of the Code.</p>
