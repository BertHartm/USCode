I74legislative statements<p class="note-body">Section 927(b) of the House amendment is derived from section 927(b) of the Senate bill. The provision requires mandatory dismissal if confirmation of a plan is refused.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House amendment deletes section 929 of the Senate amendment as unnecessary since the bankruptcy court has original exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under chapter 9.</p>
<p class="note-body">The House amendment deletes section 930 of the Senate amendment and incorporates section 507(a)(1) by reference.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">senate report no. 95&ndash;989</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 927 conforms to section 98 of current law [section 418 of former title 11]. The Section permits dismissal by the court for unreasonable delay by the debtor, failure to propose a plan, failure of acceptance of a plan, or default by the debtor under a conformed plan. Mandatory dismissal is required if confirmation is refused.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">house report no. 95&ndash;595</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 926 [enacted as section 927] generally conforms to section 98(a) [section 418(a) of former title 11] <!-- PDFPage:169 -->of current law. Stylistic changes have been made to conform the language with that used in chapter 11, section 1112. The section permits dismissal by the court for unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors, failure to propose a plan, failure of confirmation of a plan, or material default by the debtor under a confirmed plan. The only significant change from current law lies in the second ground. Currently, section 98(a)(2) provides for dismissal if a proposed plan is not accepted, and section 98(b) <em>requires</em> dismissal if an accepted plan is not confirmed. In order to provide greater flexibility to the court, the debtor, and creditors, the bill allows the court to permit the debtor to propose another plan if the first plan is not confirmed. In that event the debtor need not, as under current law, commence the case all over again. This could provide savings in time and administrative expenses if a plan is denied confirmation.</p>
