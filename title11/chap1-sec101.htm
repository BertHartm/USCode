<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
I74legislative statements<p class="note-body">Section 101(2) defines &ldquo;affiliate.&rdquo; The House amendment contains a provision that is a compromise between the definition in the House-passed version of H.R. 8200 and the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 8200. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) are derived from the Senate amendment and subparagraph (D) is taken from the House bill, while subparagraph (C) represents a compromise, taking the House position with respect to a person whose business is operated under a lease or an operating agreement by the debtor and with respect to a person substantially all of whose property is operated under an operating agreement by the debtor and with respect to a person substantially all of whose property is operated under an operating agreement by the debtor and the Senate position on leased property. Thus, the definition of &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; excludes persons substantially all of whose property is operated under a lease agreement by a debtor, such as a small company which owns equipment all of which is leased to a larger nonrelated company.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(4)(B) represents a modification of the House-passed bill to include the definition of &ldquo;claim&rdquo; a right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment. This is intended to cause the liquidation or estimation of contingent rights of payment for which there may be an alternative equitable remedy with the result that the equitable remedy will be susceptible to being discharged in bankruptcy. For example, in some States, a judgment for specific performance may be satisfied by an alternative right to payment, in the event performance is refused; in that event, the creditor entitled to specific performance would have a &ldquo;claim&rdquo; for purposes of a proceeding under title 11.</p>
<p class="note-body">On the other hand, rights to an equitable remedy for a breach of performance with respect to which such breach does not give rise to a right to payment are not &ldquo;claims&rdquo; and would therefore not be susceptible to discharge in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="note-body">In a case under chapter 9 to title 11, &ldquo;claim&rdquo; does not include a right to payment under an industrial development bond issued by a municipality as a matter of convenience for a third party.</p>
<p class="note-body">Municipalities are authorized, under section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended [title 26], to issue tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds to provide for the financing of certain projects for privately owned companies. The bonds are sold on the basis of the credit of the company on whose behalf they are issued, and the principal, interest, and premium, if any, are payable solely from payments made by the company to the trustee under the bond indenture and do not constitute claims on the tax revenues or other funds of the issuing municipalities. The municipality merely acts as the vehicle to enable the bonds to be issued on a tax-exempt basis. Claims that <!-- PDFPage:15 -->arise by virtue of these bonds are not among the claims defined by this paragraph and amounts owed by private companies to the holders of industrial development revenue bonds are not to be included among the assets of the municipality that would be affected by the plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(6) defines &ldquo;community claim&rdquo; as provided by the Senate amendment in order to indicate that a community claim exists whether or not there is community property in the estate as of the commencement of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(7) of the House amendment contains a definition of consumer debt identical to the definition in the House bill and Senate amendment. A consumer debt does not include a debt to any extent the debt is secured by real property.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(9) of the Senate amendment contained a definition of &ldquo;court.&rdquo; The House amendment deletes the provision as unnecessary in light of the pervasive jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court under all chapters of title 11 as indicated in title II of the House amendment to H.R. 8200.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(11) defines &ldquo;debt&rdquo; to mean liability on a claim, as was contained in the House-passed version of H.R. 8200. The Senate amendment contained language indicating that &ldquo;debt&rdquo; does not include a policy loan made by a life insurance company to the debtor. That language is deleted in the House amendment as unnecessary since a life insurance company clearly has no right to have a policy loan repaid by the debtor, although such company does have a right of offset with respect to such policy loan. Clearly, then, a &ldquo;debt&rdquo; does not include a policy loan made by a life insurance company. Inclusion of the language contained in the Senate amendment would have required elaboration of other legal relationships not arising by a liability on a claim. Further the language would have required clarification that interest on a policy loan made by a life insurance company is a debt, and that the insurance company does have right to payment to that interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(14) adopts the definition of &ldquo;entity&rdquo; contained in the Senate-passed version of H.R. 8200. Since the Senate amendment to H.R. 8200 deleted the U.S. trustee, a corresponding definitional change is made in chapter 15 of the House amendment for U.S. trustees under the pilot program. Adoption by the House amendment of a pilot program for U.S. trustees under chapter 15 requires insertion of &ldquo;United States trustee&rdquo; in many sections. Several provisions in chapter 15 of the House amendment that relate to the U.S. trustee were not contained in the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(17) defines &ldquo;farmer,&rdquo; as in the Senate amendment with an income limitation percentage of 80 percent instead of 75 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(18) contains a new definition of &ldquo;farming operation&rdquo; derived from present law and the definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; in the Senate amendment. This definition gives a broad construction to the term &ldquo;farming operation&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(20) contains a definition of &ldquo;foreign representative&rdquo;. It clarifies the House bill and Senate amendment by indicating that a foreign representative must be duly selected in a foreign proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(35) defines &ldquo;security&rdquo; as contained in the Senate amendment. H.R. 8200 as adopted by the House excluded certain commercial notes from the definition of &ldquo;security&rdquo;, and that exclusion is deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(40) defines &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; as in the Senate amendment. The definition contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House included &ldquo;setoff&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;transfer&rdquo;. Inclusion of &ldquo;setoff&rdquo; is deleted. The effect is that a &ldquo;setoff&rdquo; is not subject to being set aside as a preferential &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; but will be subject to special rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">senate report no. 95&ndash;989</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 101 of title 11 contains 40 definitions:</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) defines &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; as an accountant authorized under applicable law to practice accounting. The term includes a professional accounting association, corporation, or partnership if applicable law authorizes such a unit to practice accounting.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) defines &ldquo;affiliate.&rdquo; An affiliate is an entity with a close relationship to the debtor. It includes a 20 percent parent or subsidiary of the debtor, whether a corporate, partnership, individual, or estate parent.</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; in subparagraphs (A) and (B) is intended to cover situations in which there is an opportunity to control, and where the existence of that opportunity operates as indirect control.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Affiliate&rdquo; is defined primarily for use in the definition of insider, infra, and for use in the chapter 11 reorganization cases. The definition of &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; does not include an entity acting in a fiduciary or agency capacity if the entity does not have the sole discretionary power to vote 20 percent of the voting securities but hold them solely as security and have not exercised the power to vote. This restriction applies to a corporate affiliate under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (C) and (D) of paragraph (2) define affiliate also as those persons and entities whose business or substantially all of whose property is operated under a lease or operating agreement by a debtor and whose business or property is more than 50 percent under the control of the debtor.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; in paragraph (3) is similar to the definition of accountant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (4) defines &ldquo;claim.&rdquo; The effect of the definition is a significant departure from present law. Under present law, &ldquo;claim&rdquo; is not defined in straight bankruptcy. Instead it is simply used, along with the concept of provability in section 63 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 103 of former title 11], to limit the kinds of obligations that are payable in a bankruptcy case. The term is defined in the debtor rehabilitation chapters of present law far more broadly. The definition in paragraph (4) adopts an even broader definition of claim than is found in the present debtor rehabilitation chapters. The definition is any right to payment, whether or not reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured. The definition also includes as a claim an equitable right to performance that does not give rise to a right to payment. By this broadest possible definition and by the use of the term throughout the title 11, especially in subchapter I of chapter 5, the bill contemplates that all legal obligations of the debtor, no matter how remote or contingent, will be able to be dealt with in the bankruptcy case. It permits the broadest possible relief in the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (5) defines &ldquo;commodity broker&rdquo; by reference to various terms used and defined in subchapter IV of chapter 7, Commodity Broker Liquidation. The terms are described in connection with section 761, infra.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (6) defines &ldquo;community claim&rdquo; for those eight States that have community property laws. The definition is keyed to the liability of the debtor's property for a claim against either the debtor or the debtor's spouse. If the debtor's property is liable for a claim against either, that claim is a community claim.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (7) defines &ldquo;consumer debt&rdquo;. The definition is adapted from the definition used in various consumer protection laws. It encompasses only a debt incurred by an individual primarily for a personal, family, or household purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; in paragraph (8) is similar to the definition in current law, section 1(8) [section 1(8) of former title 11]. The term encompasses any association having the power or privilege that a private corporation, but not an individual or partnership, has; partnership associations organized under a law that makes only the capital subscribed responsible for the debts of the partnership; joint-stock company; unincorporated company or association; and business trust. &ldquo;Unincorporated association&rdquo; is intended specifically to include a labor union, as well as other bodies that come under that phrase as used under current law. <!-- PDFPage:16 -->The exclusion of limited partnerships is explicit, and not left to the case law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (9) defines &ldquo;court&rdquo; as the bankruptcy judge in the district in which the case is pending except in municipal adjustment and railroad reorganization cases, where &ldquo;court&rdquo; means the Federal district judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (10) [enacted as (9)] defines &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; to include holders of prepetition claims against the debtor. However, it also encompasses certain holders of claims that are deemed to arise before the date of the filing of the petition, such as those injured by the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, certain investment tax credit recapture claim holders, &ldquo;involuntary gap&rdquo; creditors, and certain holders of the right of setoff. The term also includes the holder of a prepetition community claim. A guarantor of or surety for a claim against the debtor is also a creditor, because he holds a contingent claim against the debtor that becomes fixed when he pays the creditor whose claim he has guaranteed or insured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (11) [enacted as (10)] defines &ldquo;custodian.&rdquo; There is no similar definition in current law. It is defined to facilitate drafting, and means a prepetition liquidator of the debtor's property, such as an assignee for the benefit of creditors, a receiver of the debtor's property, or administrator of the debtor's property. The definition of custodian to include a receiver or trustee is descriptive, and not meant to be limited to court officers with those titles. The definition is intended to include other officers of the court if their functions are substantially similar to those of a receiver or trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Debt&rdquo; is defined in paragraph (12) [enacted as (11)] as a liability on a claim. The terms &ldquo;debt&rdquo; and &ldquo;claim&rdquo; are coextensive: a creditor has a &ldquo;claim&rdquo; against the debtor; the debtor owes a &ldquo;debt&rdquo; to the creditor. This definition of &ldquo;debt&rdquo; and the definition of &ldquo;claim&rdquo; on which it is based, proposed 11 U.S.C. 101(4), does not include a transaction such as a policy loan on an insurance policy. Under that kind of transaction, the debtor is not liable to the insurance company for repayment; the amount owed is merely available to the company for setoff against any benefits that become payable under the policy. As such, the loan is not a claim (it is not a right to payment) that the company can assert against the estate; nor is the debtor's obligation a debt (a liability on a claim) that will be discharged under proposed 11 U.S.C. 523 or 524.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (13) [enacted as (12)] defines &ldquo;debtor.&rdquo; Debtor means person or municipality concerning which a case under title II has been commenced. This is a change in terminology from present law, which identifies the person by or against whom a petition is filed in a straight bankruptcy liquidation case as the &ldquo;bankrupt&rdquo;, and a person or municipality that is proceeding under a debtor rehabilitation chapter (chapters VIII through XIII of the Bankruptcy Act) [chapters 8 through 13 of former title 11] as a &ldquo;debtor.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;debtor&rdquo; is used for both kinds of cases in this bill, for ease of reference in chapters 1, 3, and 5 (which apply to straight bankruptcy and reorganization cases).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (14) [enacted as (13)] defines &ldquo;disinterested person.&rdquo; The definition is adapted from section 158 of chapter X of current law [section 558 of former title 11], though it is expanded and modified in some respects. A person is a disinterested person if the person is not a creditor, equity security holder, or insider; is not and was not an investment banker of the debtor for any outstanding security of the debtor (the change from underwriter in current law to investment banker is to make the term more descriptive and to avoid conflict with the definition of underwriter in section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(11)); has not been an investment banker for a security of the debtor within 3 years before the date of the filing of the petition (the change from five years to three years here conforms the definition with the statute of limitations in the Securities Act of 1933) [15 U.S.C. 77m], or an attorney for such an investment banker; is not an insider of the debtor or of such an investment banker; and does not have an interest materially adverse to the estate.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Entity&rdquo; is defined, for convenience, in paragraph (15) [enacted as (14)], to include person, estate, trust, and governmental unit. It is the most inclusive of the various defined terms relating to bodies or units.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (16) defines &ldquo;equity security.&rdquo; The term includes a share or stock in a corporation, a limited partner's interest in a limited partnership, and a warrant or right to subscribe to an equity security. The term does not include a security, such as a convertible debenture, that is convertible into equity security, but has not been converted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (17) [enacted as (15)] defines &ldquo;equity security holder&rdquo; for convenience as the holder of an equity securing of the debtor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (18) [enacted as (17)] defines &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;. It encompasses only those persons for whom farming operations contribute 75 percent or more of their total income.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (19) and (20) define &ldquo;foreign proceeding&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign representative&rdquo;. A foreign proceeding is a proceeding in another country in which the debtor has some substantial connection for the purpose of liquidating the estate of the debtor or the purpose of financial rehabilitation of the debtor. A foreign representative is the representative of the estate in a foreign proceeding, such as a trustee or administrator.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (21) defines &ldquo;governmental unit&rdquo; in the broadest sense. The definition encompasses the United States, a State, Commonwealth, District, Territory, municipality, or foreign state, and a department, agency, or instrumentality of any of those entities. &ldquo;Department, agency, or instrumentality&rdquo; does not include an entity that owes its existence to State action, such as the granting of a charter or a license but that has no other connection with a State or local government or the Federal Government. The relationship must be an active one in which the department, agency, or instrumentality is actually carrying out some governmental function.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (22) defines &ldquo;indenture.&rdquo; It is similar to the definition of indenture in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 [15 U.S.C. 77ccc(7)]. An indenture is the instrument under which securities, either debt or equity, of the debtor are outstanding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (23) defines &ldquo;indenture trustee&rdquo; as the trustee under an indenture.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (24) defines &ldquo;individual with regular income.&rdquo; The effect of this definition, and of its use in section 109(e), is to expand substantially the kinds of individuals that are eligible for relief under chapter 13, Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income. Chapter XIII [chapter 13 of former title 11] is now available only for wage earners. The definition encompasses all individuals with incomes that are sufficiently stable and regular to enable them to make payments under a chapter 13 plan. Thus, individuals on welfare, social security, fixed pension incomes, or who live on investment incomes, will be able to work out repayment plans with their creditors rather than being forced into straight bankruptcy. Also, self-employed individuals will be eligible to use chapter 13 if they have regular incomes.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, the definition excludes certain stockbrokers and commodity brokers, in order to prohibit them from proceeding under chapter 13 and avoiding the customer protection provisions of chapter 7.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Insider&rdquo;, defined in paragraph (25), is a new term. An insider is one who has a sufficiently close relationship with the debtor that his conduct is made subject to closer scrutiny than those dealing at arms length with the debtor. If the debtor is an individual, then a relative of the debtor, a partnership in which the debtor is a general partner, a general partner of the debtor, and a corporation controlled by the debtor are all insiders. If the debtor is a corporation, then a controlling person, a relative of a controlling person, a partnership in which the debtor is a general partner, and a general partner of the debtor are all insiders. If the debtor is a partnership, then a general partner of or in the debtor, a relative of a general partner in the debtor, and a per<!-- PDFPage:17 -->son in control are all insiders. If the debtor is a municipality, then an elected official of the debtor is an insider. In addition, affiliates of the debtor and managing agents are insiders.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;insolvent&rdquo; in paragraph (26) is adopted from section 1(19) of current law [section 1(19) of former title 11]. An entity is insolvent if its debts are greater than its assets, at a fair valuation, exclusive of property exempted or fraudulently transferred. It is the traditional bankruptcy balance sheet test of insolvency. For a partnership, the definition is modified to account for the liability of a general partner for the partnership's debts. The difference in this definition from that in current law is in the exclusion of exempt property for all purposes in the definition of insolvent.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (27) defines &ldquo;judicial lien.&rdquo; It is one of three kinds of liens defined in this section. A judicial lien is a lien obtained by judgment, levy, sequestration, or other legal or equitable process or proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (28) defines &ldquo;lien.&rdquo; The definition is new and is very broad. A lien is defined as a charge against or interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation. It includes inchoate liens. In general, the concept of lien is divided into three kinds of liens: judicial liens, security interests, and statutory liens. Those three categories are mutually exclusive and are exhaustive except for certain common law liens.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (29) defines &ldquo;municipality.&rdquo; The definition is adapted from the terms used in the chapter IX (municipal bankruptcy) [chapter 9 of former title 11] amendment to the Bankruptcy Act enacted in 1976 (Pub. L. 94&ndash;260). That amendment spoke in terms of &ldquo;political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a State&rdquo;. Bankruptcy Act Sec. 84 [section 404 of former title 11]. The term municipality is defined by those three terms for convenience. It does not include the District of Columbia or any territories of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Person&rdquo; is defined in paragraph (30). The definition is a change in wording, but not in substance, from the definition in section 1(23) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 1(23) of former title 11]. The definition is also similar to the one contained in 1 U.S.C. sec. 1, but is repeated here for convenience and ease of reference. Person includes individual partnership, and corporation. The exclusion of governmental units is made explicit in order to avoid any confusion that may arise if, for example, a municipality is incorporated and thus is legally a corporation as well as governmental unit. The definition does not include an estate or a trust, which are included only in the definition of &ldquo;entity&rdquo; in proposed 11 U.S.C. 101(14).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Petition&rdquo; is defined for convenience in paragraph (31). Petition is a petition under section 301, 302, 303, or 304 of the bankruptcy code&mdash;that is, a petition that commences a case under title 11.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (32) defines purchaser as a transferee of a voluntary transfer, such as a sale or gift, and includes an immediate or mediate transferee of a purchaser.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;railroad&rdquo; in paragraph (33) is derived from section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 205 of former title 11]. A railroad is a common carrier by railroad engaged in the transportation of individuals or property, or an owner of trackage facilities leased by such a common carrier. The effect of the definition and the use of the term in section 109(d) is to eliminate the limitation now found in section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act that only railroads engaged in interstate commerce may proceed under the railroad reorganization provisions. The limitation may have been inserted because of a doubt that the commerce power could not reach intrastate railroads. Be that as it may, this bill is enacted under the bankruptcy power.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (34) defines &ldquo;relative&rdquo; as an individual related by affinity or consanguinity within the third degree as determined by the common law, and includes individuals in a step or adoptive relationship. The definition is similar to current law, but adds the latter phrase. This definition should be applied as of the time when the transaction that it concerns took place. Thus, a former spouse is not a relative, but if, for example, for purposes of the preference section, proposed 11 U.S.C. 547(b)(4)(B), the transferee was a spouse of the debtor at the time of the transfer sought to be avoided, then the transferee would be relative and subject to the insider rules, even if the transferee was no longer married to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case or at the time of the commencement of the preference recovery proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (35) defines &ldquo;security.&rdquo; The definition is new and is modeled on the most recent draft of the American Law Institute's proposed securities code, with some exceptions. The interest of a limited partner in a limited partnership is included in order to make sure that everything that is defined as an equity security is also a &ldquo;security.&rdquo; The definition, as with the definition of &ldquo;entity&rdquo;, &ldquo;insider&rdquo;, and &ldquo;person&rdquo;, is open-ended because the term is not susceptible of precise specification. Thus the courts will be able to use the characterization provided in this definition to treat with new kinds of documents on a flexible basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (36) and (37) defined &ldquo;security agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;security interest.&rdquo; A security interest is one of the kinds of liens. It is a lien created by an agreement. Security agreement is defined as the agreement creating the security interest. Though these terms are similar to the same terms in the Uniform Commercial Code, article IX, they are broader. For example, the U.C.C. does not cover real property mortgages. Under this definition, such a mortgage is included, as are all other liens created by agreement, even though not covered by the U.C.C. All U.C.C. security interests and security agreements are, however, security interests and security agreements under this definition. Whether a consignment or a lease constitutes a security interest under the bankruptcy code will depend on whether it constitutes a security interest under applicable State or local law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (38) defines another kind of lien, &ldquo;statutory lien.&rdquo; The definition, derived from current law, states that a statutory lien is a lien arising solely by force of statute on specified circumstances or conditions and includes a lien of distress for rent (whether statutory, common law, or otherwise). The definition excludes judicial liens and security interests, whether or not they are provided for or are dependent on a statute, and whether or not they are made fully effective by statute. A statutory lien is only one that arises automatically, and is not based on an agreement to give a lien or on judicial action. Mechanics&rsquo;, materialmen's, and warehousemen's liens are examples. Tax liens are also included in the definition of statutory lien.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Stockbroker&rdquo; is defined in paragraph (39) as a person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others or with members of the general public from or for such person's own account, if the person has a customer, as defined. Thus, the definition, derived from a combination of the definitions of &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c], encompasses both brokers and dealers. The definition is used in section 109 and in subchapter III of chapter 7, Stockholder Liquidation. The term does not encompass an employee who acts for a principal that &ldquo;effects&rdquo; transaction or deals with the public, because such an employee will not have a &ldquo;customer&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (40) defines &ldquo;transfer.&rdquo; It is derived and adapted, with stylistic changes, from section 1(30) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 1(30) of former title 11]. A transfer is a disposition of an interest in property. The definition of transfer is as broad as possible. Many of the potentially limiting words in current law are deleted, and the language is simplified. Under this definition, any transfer of an interest in property is a transfer, including a transfer of possession, custody, or control even if there is no transfer of title, because possession, custody, and control are interests in property. A deposit in a bank account or similar account is a transfer.</p>
