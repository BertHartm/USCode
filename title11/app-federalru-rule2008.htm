<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The United States trustee shall immediately notify the person selected as trustee how to qualify and, if applicable, the amount of the trustee's bond. A trustee that has filed a blanket bond pursuant to Rule 2010 and has been selected as trustee in a chapter 7, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case that does not notify the court and the United States trustee in writing of rejection of the office within five days after receipt of notice of selection shall be deemed to have accepted the office. Any other person selected as trustee shall notify the court and the United States trustee in writing of acceptance of the office within five days after receipt of notice of selection or shall be deemed to have rejected the office.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 209(c). The remainder of that rule is inapplicable because its provisions are covered by &sect;&sect;701&ndash;703, 321 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the person selected as trustee accepts the office, he must qualify within five days after his selection, as required by &sect;322(a) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In districts having a standing trustee for chapter 13 cases, a blanket acceptance of the appointment would <!-- PDFPage:34 -->be sufficient for compliance by the standing trustee with this rule.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to eliminate the need for a standing chapter 13 trustee or member of the panel of chapter 7 trustees to accept or reject an appointment.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to this rule relating to the United States trustee are derived from Rule X&ndash;1004(a) and conform to the 1986 amendments to the Code and 28 U.S.C. &sect;586 which provide that the United States trustee appoints and supervises trustees, and in a chapter 7 case presides over any election of a trustee. This rule applies when a trustee is either appointed or elected. This rule is also amended to provide for chapter 12 cases.</p>
