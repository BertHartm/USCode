<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form is amended to include debts described in section 523(a)(15) of the Code, which was added by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, in the list of debts discharged unless determined by the court to be nondischargeable.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The discharge order has been simplified by deleting paragraphs which had detailed some, but not all, of the effects of the discharge. These paragraphs have been replaced with a plain English explanation of the discharge. This explanation is to be printed on the reverse of the order, to increase understanding of the bankruptcy discharge among creditors and debtors. The bracketed sentence in the second paragraph should be included when the case involves community property.</p>
