<h3 class="section-head">Rule 4004. Grant or Denial of Discharge</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Time for Filing Complaint Objecting to Discharge; Notice of Time Fixed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 7 liquidation case a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge under &sect;727(a) of the Code shall be filed not later than 60 days following the first date set for the meeting of creditors held pursuant to &sect;341(a). In a chapter 11 reorganization case, such complaint shall be filed not later than the first date set for the hearing on confirmation. Not less than 25 days notice of the time so fixed shall be given to the United States trustee and all creditors as provided in Rule 2002(f) and (k) and to the trustee and the trustee's attorney.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Extension of Time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion of any party in interest, after hearing on notice, the court may extend for cause the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge. The motion shall be made before such time has expired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Grant of Discharge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 7 case, on expiration of the time fixed for filing a complaint objecting to discharge and the time fixed for filing a motion to dismiss the case pursuant to Rule 1017(e), the court shall forthwith grant the discharge unless (1) the debtor is not an individual, (2) a complaint objecting to the discharge has been filed, (3) the debtor has filed a waiver under &sect;727(a)(10), or (4) a motion to dismiss the case under Rule 1017(e) is pending. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on motion of the debtor, the court may defer the entry of an order granting a discharge for 30 days and, on motion within such period, the court may defer entry of the order to a date certain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability of Rules in Part VII</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proceeding commenced by a complaint objecting to discharge is governed by Part VII of these rules.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Order of Discharge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order of discharge shall conform to the appropriate Official Form.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Registration in Other Districts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order of discharge that has become final may be registered in any other district by filing a certified copy of the order in the office of the clerk of that district. When so registered the order of discharge shall have the same effect as an order of the court of the district where registered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Notice of Discharge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall promptly mail a copy of the final order of discharge to those specified in subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 404.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:52 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> of this rule prescribe the procedure for determining whether a discharge will be granted pursuant to &sect;727 of the Code. The time fixed by subdivision (a) may be enlarged as provided in subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice referred to in subdivision (a) is required to be given by mail and addressed to creditors as provided in Rule 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body">An extension granted on a motion pursuant to subdivision (b) of the rule would ordinarily benefit only the movant, but its scope and effect would depend on the terms of the extension.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> If a complaint objecting to discharge is filed, the court's grant or denial of the discharge will be entered at the conclusion of the proceeding as a judgment in accordance with Rule 9021. The inclusion of the clause in subdivision (c) qualifying the duty of the court to grant a discharge when a waiver has been filed is in accord with the construction of the Code. 4 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;727.12 (15th ed. 1979).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (c) takes cognizance of &sect;524(c) of the Code which authorizes a debtor to enter into enforceable reaffirmation agreements only prior to entry of the order of discharge. Immediate entry of that order after expiration of the time fixed for filing complaints objecting to discharge may render it more difficult for a debtor to settle pending litigation to determine the dischargeability of a debt and execute a reaffirmation agreement as part of a settlement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d).</em> An objection to discharge is required to be made by a complaint, which initiates an adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003. Pursuant to Rule 5005, the complaint should be filed in the court in which the case is pending.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e).</em> Official Form No. 27 to which subdivision (e) refers, includes notice of the effects of a discharge specified in &sect;524(a) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f).</em> Registration may facilitate the enforcement of the order of discharge in a district other than that in which it was entered. See 2 Moore's <em>Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;1.04[2] (2d ed. 1967). Because of the nationwide service of process authorized by Rule 7004, however, registration of the order of discharge is not necessary under these rules to enable a discharged debtor to obtain relief against a creditor proceeding anywhere in the United States in disregard of the injunctive provisions of the order of discharge.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g).</em> Notice of discharge should be mailed promptly after the order becomes final so that creditors may be informed of entry of the order and of its injunctive provisions. Rule 2002 specifies the manner of the notice and persons to whom the notice is to be given.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to conform to &sect;727(c) which gives the United States trustee the right to object to discharge. This amendment is derived from Rule X&ndash;1008(a)(1) and is consistent with Rule 2002. The amendment to subdivision (c) is to prevent a timely motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse from becoming moot merely because a discharge order has been entered. Reference to the Official Form number in subdivision (e) is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
