<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991</h4>
<p class="note-body">This form consolidates questions from former Official Forms No. 7, No. 8, and No. 10. This form is to be completed by all debtors. An individual debtor engaged in business as a sole proprietor, partner, family farmer, or self-employed professional should provide the information requested on this statement concerning all such activities as well as the individual's personal affairs.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Chapter 13 Statement, former Official Form No. 10, has been abrogated. Chapter 13 debtors are to complete this statement and the schedules prescribed in Official Form 6.</p>
<p class="note-body">All questions have been converted to affirmative directions to furnish information, and each question must be answered. If the answer is &ldquo;none,&rdquo; or the question is not applicable, the debtor is required to so state by marking the box labeled &ldquo;None&rdquo; provided at each question.</p>
<p class="note-body">See Committee Note to Form 2 for a discussion of the unsworn declaration at the end of this form.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been amended in two ways. In the second paragraph of the instructions, the third sentence has been deleted to clarify that only a debtor that is or has been in business as defined in the form should answer Questions 16&ndash;21. In addition, administrative proceedings have been added to the types of legal actions to be disclosed in Question 4.a.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This form is a &ldquo;document for filing&rdquo; that may be prepared by a &ldquo;bankruptcy petition preparer&rdquo; as defined in 11 U.S.C. &sect;110, which was added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994; accordingly, a signature line for such preparer is added. In addition to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by section 110 to disclose the information requested.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been amended to provide more information to taxing authorities, pension fund supervisors, and governmental units charged with environmental protection and regulation. Four new questions have been added to the form, covering community property owned by a debtor and the debtor's non-filing spouse or former spouse (Question 16), environmental information (Question 17), any consolidated tax group of a corporate debtor (Question 24), and the debtor's contributions to any employee pension fund (Question 25). In addition, every debtor will be required to state on the form whether the debtor has been in business within six years before filing the petition and, if so, must answer the remaining questions on the form (Questions 19&ndash;25). This is an enlargement of the two-year period previously specified. One reason for the longer &ldquo;reach back&rdquo; period is that business debtors often owe taxes that have been owed for more than two years. Another is that some of the questions already addressed to business debtors request information for the six-year period before the commencement of the case. Application of a six-year period to this section of the form will assure disclosure of all relevant information.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to &sect;110(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition preparer requires a petition preparer to provide the full social security number of the individual who actually prepares the document.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form is amended in several ways to reflect changes in the Bankruptcy Code made by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109&ndash;8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005). A new sentence in the introduction advises the debtor not to disclose the name and address of any minor child.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;in business&rdquo; is amended in the introductory section and in Question 1 and Question 18 to clarify that various part-time activities can result in the debtor being &ldquo;in business&rdquo; for purposes of the form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Question 1 is amended to specify that, in addition to the income from the debtor's primary employment, the debtor must include income from part-time activities either as an employee or from self-employment. The debtor now also will report the source of all income from employment or operation of a business, even if there is only one source, in order to assist the trustee in reviewing the pay stubs, etc., filed by the debtor in the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Question 3 is amended to accommodate amendments to &sect;547(c) of the Code enacted in 2005 which exempt from recovery by the trustee payments by a debtor for a domestic support obligation or as part of an alternative repayment schedule negotiated by an approved nonprofit budgeting and credit counseling agency. In addition, Question 3 now requires a debtor with primarily non-consumer debts to report only those transfers that aggregate more than $5,000 to any creditor in the 90-day period prior to the filing of the petition, as a result of the addition of &sect;547(c)(9) to the Code in 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body">In Question 10, the extension of the reachback period for transfers from one year to two years reflects the 2005 amendment to &sect;548(a)(1) of the Code to permit a trustee to avoid a fraudulent transfer made by the debtor within two years of the date of the filing of the petition. Question 10 also is amended to implement new &sect;548(e) added to the Code in 2005 to require the debtor to disclose all transfers to any self-settled asset protection trust within the ten years before the filing of the petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Question 15 is amended to extend from two years to three years the preterition time period for which the debtor must disclose the addresses of all premises occupied by the debtor. This information will assist the trustee, the United States trustee, and the court to ascertain whether any homestead exemption asserted by the debtor is properly claimed under &sect;522(v)(3)(A) as amended, and &sect;&sect;522(p) and (q) as added to the Code in 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form also is amended to extend from six years to eight years the period before the filing of the petition concerning which the debtor is required to disclose the name of the debtor's spouse or of any former spouse who resides or resided with the debtor in a community property state. In addition, the certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition preparer is renamed a &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; and is amended to include material mandated by 11 U.S.C. &sect;110 as amended by the 2005 Act.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005&ndash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">[The 2005&ndash;2007 Committee Note incorporates the Committee Note previously published in 2005.]</p>
<p class="note-body">The form is amended in several ways to reflect changes in the Bankruptcy Code made by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109&ndash;8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005). A new sentence in the introduction advises the debtor not to disclose the name and address of any minor child in conformity with &sect;112, which was added to the Code by the 2005 Act. In addition, the form is amended to add to the reference to Rule 1007(m) with respect to a minor child a direction to include for noticing purposes the name, address, and legal relationship to the child of &ldquo;a person described&rdquo; in that rule. Rule 1007(m) requires the person named to be someone on whom process would be served in an adversary proceeding against the child.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;in business&rdquo; is amended in the introductory section and in Question 1 and Question 18 to clarify that various part-time activities can result in the debtor being &ldquo;in business&rdquo; for purposes of the form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Question 1 is amended to specify that, in addition to the income from the debtor's primary employment, the <!-- PDFPage:194 -->debtor must include income from part-time activities either as an employee or from self-employment. The debtor now also will report the source of all income from employment or operation of a business, even if there is only one source, in order to assist the trustee in reviewing the pay stubs, etc., filed by the debtor in the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Question 3 is amended to accommodate amendments to &sect;547(c) of the Code enacted in 2005 which exempt from recovery by the trustee payments by a debtor for a domestic support obligation or as part of an alternative repayment schedule negotiated by an approved nonprofit budgeting and credit counseling agency. In addition, Question 3 now requires a debtor with primarily non-consumer debts to report only those transfers that aggregate more than $5,475 to any creditor in the 90-day period prior to the filing of the petition, as a result of the addition of &sect;547(c)(9) to the Code in 2005. In addition, the language of the question is revised for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In Question 10, the extension of the reach-back period for transfers from one year to two years reflects the 2005 amendment to &sect;548(a)(1) of the Code to permit a trustee to avoid a fraudulent transfer made by the debtor within two years before the date of the filing of the petition. Question 10 also is amended to implement new &sect;548(e) added to the Code in 2005 to require the debtor to disclose all transfers to any self-settled asset protection trust within the ten years before the filing of the petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Question 15 is amended to extend from two years to three years the prepetition time period for which the debtor must disclose the addresses of all premises occupied by the debtor. This information will assist the trustee, the United States trustee, and the court to ascertain whether any homestead exemption asserted by the debtor is properly claimed under &sect;522(b)(3)(A) as amended, and &sect;&sect;522(p) [sic] and (q) as added to the Code in 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form also is amended to extend from six years to eight years the period before the filing of the petition concerning which the debtor is required to disclose the name of the debtor's spouse or of any former spouse who resides or resided with the debtor in a community property state. In addition, the certification by a non-attorney bankruptcy petition preparer is renamed a &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; and is amended to include material mandated by 11 U.S.C. &sect;110 as amended by the 2005 Act.</p>
