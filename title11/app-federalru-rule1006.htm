<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">28 U.S.C. &sect;1930 specifies the filing fees for petitions under chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 of the Code. It also permits the payment in installments by individual debtors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 107. The administrative cost of installments in excess of four is disproportionate to the benefits conferred. Prolonging the period beyond 180 days after the commencement of the case causes undesirable delays in administration. Paragraph (2) accordingly continues the imposition of a maximum of four on the number of installments and retains the maximum period of installment payments allowable on an original application at 120 days. Only in extraordinary cases should it be necessary to give an applicant an extension beyond the four months. The requirement of paragraph (3) that filing fees be paid in full before the debtor may pay an attorney for services in connection with the case codifies the rule declared in <em>In re Latham</em>, 271 Fed. 538 (N.D.N.Y. 1921), and <em>In re Darr</em>, 232 Fed. 415 (N.D. Cal. 1916).</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3)</em> is expanded to prohibit payments by the debtor or the chapter 13 trustee not only to attorneys but to any person who renders services to the debtor in connection with the case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Judicial Conference prescribes miscellaneous fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(b). In 1992, a $30 miscellaneous administrative fee was prescribed for all chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases. The Judicial Conference fee schedule was amended in 1993 to provide that an individual debtor may pay this fee in installments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of this rule is amended to clarify that every petition must be accompanied by any fee prescribed under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(b) that is required to be paid when a petition is filed, as well as the filing fee prescribed by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(a). By defining &ldquo;filing fee&rdquo; to include Judicial Conference fees, the procedures set forth in subdivision (b) for paying the filing fee in installments will also apply with respect to any Judicial Conference fee required to be paid at the commencement of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1006</em>. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change in subdivision (a).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8 --><h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to include a reference to new subdivision (c), which deals with fee waivers under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(f), which was added in 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1) is amended to delete the sentence requiring a disclosure that the debtor has not paid an attorney or other person in connection with the case. Inability to pay the filing fee in installments is one of the requirements for a fee waiver under the 2005 revisions to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(f). If the attorney payment prohibition were retained, payment of an attorney's fee would render many debtors ineligible for installment payments and thus enhance their eligibility for the fee waiver. The deletion of this prohibition from the rule, which was not statutorily required, ensures that debtors who have the financial ability to pay the fee in installments will do so rather than request a waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) is amended in conformance with the changes to subdivision (b)(1) to reflect the 2005 amendments. The change is meant to clarify that subdivision (b)(3) refers to payments made after the debtor has filed the bankruptcy case and after the debtor has received permission to pay the fee in installments. Otherwise, the subdivision may conflict with the intent and effect of the amendments to subdivision (b)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. No changes were made after publication.</p>
