<h4 class="note-head">Introduction and General Instructions</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 9009 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure states that the Official Forms prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States &ldquo;shall be observed and used.&rdquo; The Official Forms, accordingly, are obligatory in character.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 9009 expressly permits the user of the Official Forms to make such &ldquo;alterations as may be appropriate,&rdquo; and the use of the Official Forms has been held to be subject to a &ldquo;rule of substantial compliance.&rdquo; Some rules, for example Fed.R.Bankr.P. 3001(a), specifically state that the filed document need only &ldquo;conform substantially&rdquo; to the Official Form. A document for which an Official Form is prescribed generally will meet the standard of substantial compliance if the document contains the complete substance, that is, all of the information required by the Official Form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 9009 also expressly permits the contents of Official Forms to be rearranged, and the format of the Official Forms traditionally has been quite flexible. The forms of the voluntary petition, the schedules, and the statement of financial affairs are printed and sold by private publishers. Design features such as type face, type size, layout, and side and top margins were not prescribed by the Judicial Conference, but rather left to the professional judgment of each publisher.</p>
<p class="note-body">A great deal of variation, accordingly, has developed. Some publishers also add forms that are not official but which have been drafted by the publisher. A form for a chapter 13 plan, for example, frequently is included with commercially printed packages of forms for filing cases under chapter 13, although there is no Official Form for this purpose. The variety of formats has accelerated since the introduction of computer software for generating the petitions, schedules, and statements of affairs. It is the policy of the Judicial Conference that such diversity is desirable and should be encouraged.</p>
<p class="note-body">The sheer volume of bankruptcy cases, however, has compelled the Judicial Conference, for the first time, to prescribe the format of certain Official Forms. In particular, the format of Form 1, the Voluntary Petition, now is prescribed. This format is designed to assist the clerk of the bankruptcy court to enter the case in the court's computer database and ensures that all required information is available to both the clerk and the United States trustee at the inception of the case. The rule of substantial compliance continues to apply, however. Accordingly, publishers may vary the size and style of the type and may alter the size and shape of the boxes on the form, within the bounds of that rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Official Forms of the petitions, schedules, and statement of financial affairs, (Forms 1, 5, 6, and 7), are to be printed on one side of the paper only. Each page is to be prepunched with two holes at the top, and sufficient top margin allowed so that neither caption nor text is destroyed or obscured. Compliance with these standards will facilitate both the securing of the papers in the case file and review of the file by the public.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:112 --><p class="note-body">Although Rule 9009 permits alteration, for most of the Official Forms, alteration will be appropriate only in rare circumstances. The special forms for chapter 11 cases, on the other hand, seldom will be used without alterations. Forms 12 through 15, while legally sufficient in any chapter 11 case, are intended by the Judicial Conference, and most often will be used, as a framework for drafting a document specially tailored to the particular case. These alterations generally will take the form of additions to the prescribed elements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 9009 provides for a balance of prescribed substance, to which full adherence is expected in all but the most unusual cases, and flexible formatting, under which requirements are kept to the minimum necessary for proper operation of the courts and the bankruptcy system. While Rule 9009 recognizes the overall need for flexibility, Rule 9029 makes it clear that the Official Forms must be accepted in every bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under Rule 9029, courts may not reject documents presented for filing in novel or unfamiliar formats if those documents contain the substance prescribed by the Official Form and meet the requirements for one-sided printing, pre-punched holes, and adequate top margins. Nor are courts authorized to impose local forms which vary in substance from the Official Forms or reject papers presented for filing on Official Forms on the basis that the proffered documents differ from a locally preferred version.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">special instructions for computer-generated forms</h4>
<p class="note-body">In Form 1, the Voluntary Petition, if a box contains multiple choices, a computer-generated petition that shows only the choice made is acceptable for filing. All sections of the petition must be shown and completed, however, unless instructions on the Official Form of the petition state that the box is applicable only to cases filed under a chapter other than the one selected by the debtor. If the debtor has no information to provide for a particular box, for example if the debtor has no prior bankruptcies to report, a computer-generated petition should so indicate by stating &ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Form 6, the Schedules, on which the debtor reports all of the debtor's assets and liabilities, has been prescribed in a columnar format. Columns help to organize the information which the debtor is required to report and should be used when the printed schedules are completed on a typewriter. In a computerized law office, however, the organizational structure of the schedules can be built into the computer program, and a rigid columnar format may be a hindrance rather than a help. Schedules generated by computer which provide all of the information requested by the prescribed form are fully acceptable, regardless of the format of the printed page. The information must be appropriately labeled, however. In Schedule B, for example, all of the categories of personal property must be printed on the filed document together with the debtor's response to each. The space occupied by each category may be expanded, however, so that attachments are not needed. Instructions provided on the printed forms can simply be built into the computer program; they need not be reprinted on the filed document.</p>
<p class="note-body">Form 7, the Statement of Financial Affairs, contains a series of questions which direct the debtor to answer by furnishing information. If the answer to a question is &ldquo;None,&rdquo; or the question is not applicable, an affirmative statement to that effect is required. To assure that the trustee and the creditors can review the debtor's statement properly, the complete text of each question must be printed on the filed document.</p>
<p class="note-body">Form 9, the Notice of Filing under the Bankruptcy Code, Meeting of Creditors, and Fixing of Dates, will be prepared by the clerk of the bankruptcy court in most cases. The form is designed for use with automated printing and mailing equipment. Two free lines, which do not appear on the printed blank form, have been programmed into the form. Courts may use this space to add local information, such as directions for obtaining copies of the debtor's schedules.</p>
<p class="rules-form-source-credit">(Added Aug. 1, 1991; amended Mar. 16, 1993; Mar. 14, 1995; Oct. 1, 1997; Dec. 1, 2001; Dec. 1, 2002.)</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991</h4>
<p class="note-body">Form 1, the Voluntary Petition, is to be used to commence a voluntary case under chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. A chapter 9 petition requires other allegations, (see &sect;109(c) of the Code), but this form may be adapted for such use. The form also may be adapted for use in filing a petition ancillary to a foreign proceeding under &sect;304 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form departs from the traditional format of a captioned pleading. All of the elements of the caption prescribed in Rule 1005 have been retained. Their placement on the page, however, has been changed to make the form compatible with electronic data processing by the clerk. The form of the caption of the case for use in other documents, formerly incorporated in Official Form No. 1, has been made a separate Form 16A.</p>
<p class="note-body">All names used by the debtor, including trade names, names used in doing business, married names, and maiden names should be furnished in the spaces provided. If there is not sufficient room for all such names on the form itself, the list should be continued on an additional sheet attached to the petition. A complete list will enable creditors to identify the debtor properly when they receive notices and orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">Redesign of this form into a box format also is intended to provide the court, the United States trustee, and other interested parties with as much information as possible during the 15-day period provided by Rule 1007(c), when schedules and statements may not have been filed. The box format separates into categories the data provided by the debtor, and enables the form to be used by all voluntary debtors in all chapters.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the first time, the form requires both a street address and any separate mailing address, as well as any separate addresses used by a joint debtor. Disclosure of prior bankruptcies is new to the petition but formerly was required in the statement of financial affairs; its inclusion in the petition is intended to alert the trustee to cases in which an objection to discharge pursuant to &sect;727(a)(8) or (a)(9) or a motion to dismiss under &sect;109(g) may be appropriate. The information about pending related cases, also new to the petition, signals the clerk to assign the case to the judge to whom any related case has been assigned.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 1008 requires all petitions to be verified or contain an unsworn declaration as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746. The unsworn declaration on page two of the petition conforms with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746, which permits the declaration to be made in the manner indicated with the same force and effect as a sworn statement. The form may be adapted for use outside the United States by adding the words &ldquo;under the laws of the United States&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;perjury.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Exhibit &ldquo;A,&rdquo; to be attached to the petition of a corporate debtor, is for the purpose of supplying the Securities and Exchange Commission with information it needs at the beginning stages of a chapter 11 case in order to determine how actively to monitor the proceedings. Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; was added by &sect;322 of Pub. L. No. 98&ndash;353, the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. The references to chapters 11 and 12 of the Code found in Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; and its related allegations were added by &sect;283(aa) of the 1986 amendments, (Pub. L. No. 99&ndash;554). This exhibit has been included in the form of the petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form effects a merger of the petition and the bankruptcy cover sheet to assist the clerk in providing the statistical information required by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts pursuant to the Congressional reporting mandates of 28 U.S.C. &sect;604. The Director is authorized to change the <!-- PDFPage:113 -->particulars of the statistical portion of the form as needed in the performance of these statutory duties.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been amended to require a debtor not represented by an attorney to provide a telephone number so that court personnel, the trustee, other parties in the case, and their attorneys can contact the debtor concerning matters in the case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form is amended to provide space for signing by a &ldquo;bankruptcy petition preparer,&rdquo; as required under section 110 of the Code, which was added by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. In addition to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by section 110 to disclose the information requested. All signatories of Form 1 are requested to provide the clerk's office with a telephone number.</p>
<p class="note-body">A chapter 11 debtor that qualifies as a &ldquo;small business&rdquo; under section 101 of the Code, as amended by the 1994 Act, may elect special, expedited treatment under amendments made to chapter 11 by the 1994 Act. The court may order that a creditors committee not be appointed in a small business case. Accordingly, the first page of the petition is amended to require a small business filing under chapter 11 to identify itself. The petition also is amended to offer a small business chapter 11 debtor an opportunity to exercise its right to elect to be considered a small business at the commencement of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several clarifying and technical amendments also have been made to indicate that a debtor is to check only one box with respect to &ldquo;Type of Debtor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nature of Debt,&rdquo; to clarify the intent that the individual signing on behalf of a corporation or partnership is authorized to file the petition, and to require a debtor to represent that it is eligible for relief under the chapter of title 11 specified in the petition.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been substantially amended to simplify its format and make the form easier to complete correctly. The Latin phrase &ldquo;In re&rdquo; has been deleted as unnecessary. The amount of information requested in the boxes labeled &ldquo;Type of Debtor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nature of Debt&rdquo; has been reduced, and the reporting by a corporation of whether it is a publicly held entity has been moved to Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the petition. The box labeled &ldquo;Representation by Attorney&rdquo; has been deleted; the information it contained is requested in the signature boxes on the second page of the form.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the statistical information section, the labels on the ranges of estimated assets and liabilities have been rewritten to improve the accuracy of reporting. The asset/liability range of $10 million to $100 million has been divided into two categories to promote better statistical reporting of business cases. Requests for information in chapter 11 and chapter 12 cases concerning the number of the debtor's employees and equity security holders have been deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second page of the form has been simplified so that a debtor need only sign the petition once. The request for information concerning the filing of a plan has been deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; has been simplified. In addition, the category of chapter 11 debtors required to file Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is modified to include a corporation, partnership, or other entity, but only if the debtor has issued publicly-traded equity securities or debt instruments. Most small corporations will not be required to file Exhibit &ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2001 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been amended to require the debtor to disclose whether the debtor owns or has possession of any property that poses or is alleged to pose a threat of imminent and identifiable harm to public health or safety. If any such property exists, the debtor must complete and attach Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; describing the property, its location, and the potential danger it poses. Exhibit &ldquo;C&rdquo; will alert the United States trustee and any person selected as trustee that immediate precautionary action may be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been amended to provide a checkbox for designating a clearing bank case filed under subchapter V of chapter 7 of the Code enacted by &sect;112 of Pub. L. No. 106&ndash;554 (December 21, 2000).</p>
