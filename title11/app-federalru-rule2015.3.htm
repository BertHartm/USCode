<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2015.3. Reports of Financial Information on Entities in Which a Chapter 11 Estate Holds a Controlling or Substantial Interest</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Reporting Requirement</cap-smallcap>. In a chapter 11 case, the trustee or debtor in possession shall file periodic financial reports of the value, operations, and profitability of each entity that is not a publicly traded corporation or a debtor in a case under title 11, and in which the estate holds a substantial or controlling interest. The reports shall be prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form, and shall be based upon the most recent information reasonably available to the trustee or debtor in possession.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Time for Filing; Service</cap-smallcap>. The first report required by this rule shall be filed no later than five days before the first date set for the meeting of creditors under &sect;341 of the Code. Subsequent reports shall be filed no less frequently than every six months thereafter, until the effective date of a plan or the case is dismissed or converted. Copies of the report shall be served on the United States trustee, any committee appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code, and any other party in interest that has filed a request therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Presumption of Substantial or Controlling Interest; Judicial Determination</cap-smallcap>. For <!-- PDFPage:47 -->purposes of this rule, an entity of which the estate controls or owns at least a 20 percent interest, shall be presumed to be an entity in which the estate has a substantial or controlling interest. An entity in which the estate controls or owns less than a 20 percent interest shall be presumed not to be an entity in which the estate has a substantial or controlling interest. Upon motion, the entity, any holder of an interest therein, the United States trustee, or any other party in interest may seek to rebut either presumption, and the court shall, after notice and a hearing, determine whether the estate's interest in the entity is substantial or controlling.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Modification of Reporting Requirement</cap-smallcap>. The court may, after notice and a hearing, vary the reporting requirement established by subdivision (a) of this rule for cause, including that the trustee or debtor in possession is not able, after a good faith effort, to comply with those reporting requirements, or that the information required by subdivision (a) is publicly available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Protective Orders</cap-smallcap>. No later than 14 days before filing the first report required by this rule, the trustee or debtor in possession shall send notice to the entity in which the estate has a substantial or controlling interest, and to all holders&mdash;known to the trustee or debtor in possession&mdash;of an interest in that entity, that the trustee or debtor in possession expects to file and serve financial information relating to the entity in accordance with this rule. The entity in which the estate has a substantial or controlling interest, or a person holding an interest in that entity, may request protection of the information under &sect;107 of the Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Request</cap-smallcap>. Unless the court orders otherwise, the pendency of a request under subdivisions (c), (d), or (e) of this rule shall not alter or stay the requirements of subdivision (a).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule implements &sect;419 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (&ldquo;BAPCPA&rdquo;). Reports are to be made on the appropriate Official Form. While &sect;419 of BAPCPA places the obligation to report upon the &ldquo;debtor,&rdquo; this rule extends the obligation to include cases in which a trustee has been appointed. The court can order that the reports not be filed in appropriate circumstances, such as when the information that would be included in these reports is already available to interested parties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes After Publication</em>. In subdivision (e), the 20 day period was changed to 14 days. This better reconciles the timing of the notice and the scheduling of the &sect;341 meeting of creditors, and it is also consistent with the upcoming time computation amendments.</p>
