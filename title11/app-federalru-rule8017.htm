<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8017. Stay of Judgment of District Court or Bankruptcy Appellate Panel</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Automatic Stay of Judgment on Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Judgments of the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel are stayed until the expi<!-- PDFPage:87 -->ration of 10 days after entry, unless otherwise ordered by the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Stay Pending Appeal to the Court of Appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion and notice to the parties to the appeal, the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel may stay its judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals. The stay shall not extend beyond 30 days after the entry of the judgment of the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel unless the period is extended for cause shown. If before the expiration of a stay entered pursuant to this subdivision there is an appeal to the court of appeals by the party who obtained the stay, the stay shall continue until final disposition by the court of appeals. A bond or other security may be required as a condition to the grant or continuation of a stay of the judgment. A bond or other security may be required if a trustee obtains a stay but a bond or security shall not be required if a stay is obtained by the United States or an officer or agency thereof or at the direction of any department of the Government of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Power of Court of Appeals not Limited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This rule does not limit the power of a court of appeals or any judge thereof to stay proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of an appeal or to make any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be entered.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from Rule 62 F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 41 F.R.App.P.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> accords to the parties to an appeal 10 days within which to decide whether to pursue an appeal to the court of appeals. In ordinary civil litigation there is a similar opportunity. Rule 62(a) F.R.Civ.P. automatically stays enforcement of a district court's judgment in a civil action and Rule 41(a) F.R.App.P. provides that the mandate of the court of appeals shall not issue for 21 days, unless the court otherwise directs. The district court or bankruptcy appellate panel may reduce the 10 day period of this subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> vests in the district courts and the bankruptcy appellate panels the same authority the courts of appeals have under Rule 41(b) F.R.App.P. to stay their judgments pending appeal. Perfection of an appeal to the court of appeals while a stay entered by the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel is in effect results in the automatic continuation of that stay during the course of the appeal in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is the same as Rule 62(g) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
