Forms may be combined and their contents rearranged to permit economies in their use. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may issue additional forms for use under the Code. The forms shall be construed to be consistent with these rules and the Code.</p>

<p class="note-body">The rule continues the obligatory character of the Official Forms in the interest of facilitating the processing of the paperwork of bankruptcy administration, but provides that Official Forms will be prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The Supreme Court and the Congress will thus be relieved of the burden of considering the large number of complex forms used in bankruptcy practice. The use of the Official Forms has generally been held subject to a &ldquo;rule of substantial compliance&rdquo; and some of these rules, for example Rule 1002, specifically state that the filed document need only &ldquo;conform substantially&rdquo; to the Official Form. See also Rule 9005. The second sentence recognizes the propriety of combining and rearranging Official Forms to take advantage of technological developments and resulting economies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to issue additional forms for the guidance of the bar.</p>
