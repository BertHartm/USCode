<p class="statutory-body">Circuit councils which have authorized bankruptcy appellate panels pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(b) and the district courts may by action of a majority of the judges of the council or district court make and amend rules governing practice and procedure for appeals from orders or judgments of the bankruptcy judges to the respective bankruptcy appellate panel or district court, not inconsistent with the rules of this Part VIII. Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. governs the procedure for making and amending rules to govern appeals. In all cases not provided for by rule, the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel may regulate its practice in any manner not inconsistent with these rules.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. was amended in August 1985 to require greater participation by the public in the rule making process. The amendment to Rule 8018 incorporates Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. Under 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(b)(2), appeals may be taken to a bankruptcy appellate panel only if the district court so authorizes. If a district court does not authorize appeals to the bankruptcy appellate panel, appeals will be to the district court. This rule is amended to authorize district courts to promulgate rules for appeals.</p>
