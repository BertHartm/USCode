<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991</h4>
<p class="note-body">Form 1, the Voluntary Petition, is to be used to commence a voluntary case under chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. A chapter 9 petition requires other allegations, (see &sect;109(c) of the Code), but this form may be adapted for such use. The form also may be adapted for use in filing a petition ancillary to a foreign proceeding under &sect;304 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form departs from the traditional format of a captioned pleading. All of the elements of the caption prescribed in Rule 1005 have been retained. Their placement on the page, however, has been changed to make the form compatible with electronic data processing by the clerk. The form of the caption of the case for use in other documents, formerly incorporated in Official Form No. 1, has been made a separate Form 16A.</p>
<p class="note-body">All names used by the debtor, including trade names, names used in doing business, married names, and maiden names should be furnished in the spaces provided. If there is not sufficient room for all such names <!-- PDFPage:107 -->on the form itself, the list should be continued on an additional sheet attached to the petition. A complete list will enable creditors to identify the debtor properly when they receive notices and orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">Redesign of this form into a box format also is intended to provide the court, the United States trustee, and other interested parties with as much information as possible during the 15-day period provided by Rule 1007(c), when schedules and statements may not have been filed. The box format separates into categories the data provided by the debtor, and enables the form to be used by all voluntary debtors in all chapters.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the first time, the form requires both a street address and any separate mailing address, as well as any separate addresses used by a joint debtor. Disclosure of prior bankruptcies is new to the petition but formerly was required in the statement of financial affairs; its inclusion in the petition is intended to alert the trustee to cases in which an objection to discharge pursuant to &sect;727(a)(8) or (a)(9) or a motion to dismiss under &sect;109(g) may be appropriate. The information about pending related cases, also new to the petition, signals the clerk to assign the case to the judge to whom any related case has been assigned.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 1008 requires all petitions to be verified or contain an unsworn declaration as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746. The unsworn declaration on page two of the petition conforms with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1746, which permits the declaration to be made in the manner indicated with the same force and effect as a sworn statement. The form may be adapted for use outside the United States by adding the words &ldquo;under the laws of the United States&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;perjury.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Exhibit &ldquo;A,&rdquo; to be attached to the petition of a corporate debtor, is for the purpose of supplying the Securities and Exchange Commission with information it needs at the beginning stages of a chapter 11 case in order to determine how actively to monitor the proceedings. Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; was added by &sect;322 of Pub. L. No. 98&ndash;353, the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. The references to chapters 11 and 12 of the Code found in Exhibit &ldquo;B&rdquo; and its related allegations were added by &sect;283(aa) of the 1986 amendments, (Pub. L. No. 99&ndash;554). This exhibit has been included in the form of the petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The form effects a merger of the petition and the bankruptcy cover sheet to assist the clerk in providing the statistical information required by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts pursuant to the Congressional reporting mandates of 28 U.S.C. &sect;604. The Director is authorized to change the particulars of the statistical portion of the form as needed in the performance of these statutory duties.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been amended to require a debtor not represented by an attorney to provide a telephone number so that court personnel, the trustee, other parties in the case, and their attorneys can contact the debtor concerning matters in the case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form is amended to provide space for signing by a &ldquo;bankruptcy petition preparer,&rdquo; as required under section 110 of the Code, which was added by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. In addition to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by section 110 to disclose the information requested. All signatories of Form 1 are requested to provide the clerk's office with a telephone number.</p>
<p class="note-body">A chapter 11 debtor that qualifies as a &ldquo;small business&rdquo; under section 101 of the Code, as amended by the 1994 Act, may elect special, expedited treatment under amendments made to chapter 11 by the 1994 Act. The court may order that a creditors committee not be appointed in a small business case. Accordingly, the first page of the petition is amended to require a small business filing under chapter 11 to identify itself. The petition also is amended to offer a small business chapter 11 debtor an opportunity to exercise its right to elect to be considered a small business at the commencement of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several clarifying and technical amendments also have been made to indicate that a debtor is to check only one box with respect to &ldquo;Type of Debtor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nature of Debt,&rdquo; to clarify the intent that the individual signing on behalf of a corporation or partnership is authorized to file the petition, and to require a debtor to represent that it is eligible for relief under the chapter of title 11 specified in the petition.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been substantially amended to simplify its format and make the form easier to complete correctly. The Latin phrase &ldquo;In re&rdquo; has been deleted as unnecessary. The amount of information requested in the boxes labeled &ldquo;Type of Debtor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nature of Debt&rdquo; has been reduced, and the reporting by a corporation of whether it is a publicly held entity has been moved to Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the petition. The box labeled &ldquo;Representation by Attorney&rdquo; has been deleted; the information it contained is requested in the signature boxes on the second page of the form.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the statistical information section, the labels on the ranges of estimated assets and liabilities have been rewritten to improve the accuracy of reporting. The asset/liability range of $10 million to $100 million has been divided into two categories to promote better statistical reporting of business cases. Requests for information in chapter 11 and chapter 12 cases concerning the number of the debtor's employees and equity security holders have been deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second page of the form has been simplified so that a debtor need only sign the petition once. The request for information concerning the filing of a plan has been deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; has been simplified. In addition, the category of chapter 11 debtors required to file Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo; is modified to include a corporation, partnership, or other entity, but only if the debtor has issued publicly-traded equity securities or debt instruments. Most small corporations will not be required to file Exhibit &ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p>
