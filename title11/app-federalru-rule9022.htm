<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to enable the United States trustee to be informed of all developments in the case so that administrative and supervisory functions provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a) may be performed.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2001 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b) F.R.Civ.P., which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7005, is being restyled and amended to authorize service by electronic means&mdash;or any other means not otherwise authorized under Rule 5(b)&mdash;if consent is obtained from the person served.
