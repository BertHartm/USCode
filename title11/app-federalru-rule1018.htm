<h3 class="section-head">Rule 1018. Contested Involuntary Petitions; Contested Petitions Commencing Ancillary Cases; Proceedings to Vacate Order for Relief; Applicability of Rules in Part VII Governing Adversary Proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The following rules in Part VII apply to all proceedings relating to a contested involuntary petition, to proceedings relating to a contested petition commencing a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding, and to all proceedings to vacate an order for relief: Rules 7005, 7008&ndash;7010, 7015, 7016, 7024&ndash;7026, 7028&ndash;7037, 7052, 7054, 7056, and 7062, except as otherwise provided in Part I of these rules and unless the court otherwise directs. The court may direct that other rules in Part VII shall also apply. For the purposes of this rule a reference in the Part VII rules to adversary proceedings shall be read as a reference to proceedings relating to a contested involuntary petition, or contested ancillary petition, or proceedings to vacate an order for relief. Reference in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to the complaint shall be read as a reference to the petition.</p>

<p class="note-body">The rules in Part VII to which this rule refers are adaptations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the purpose of governing the procedure in adversary <!-- PDFPage:16 -->proceedings in cases under the Code. See the Note accompanying Rule 7001 <em>infra</em>. Because of the special need for dispatch and expedition in the determination of the issues in an involuntary petition, see <em>Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co</em>., 222 U.S. 300, 309 (1911), the objective of some of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and their adaptations in Part VII to facilitate the settlement of multiple controversies involving many persons in a single lawsuit is not compatible with the exigencies of bankruptcy administration. See <em>United States F. & G. Co. v. Bray</em>, 225 U.S. 205, 218 (1912). For that reason Rules 7013, 7014 and 7018&ndash;7023 will rarely be appropriate in a proceeding on a contested petition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Certain terms used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have altered meanings when they are made applicable in cases under the Code by these rules. See Rule 9002 <em>infra</em>. This Rule 1018 requires that the terms &ldquo;adversary proceedings&rdquo; when used in the rules in Part VII and &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; when used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure be given altered meanings when they are made applicable to proceedings relating to a contested petition or proceedings to vacate any order for relief. A motion to vacate an order for relief, whether or not made on a petition that was or could have been contested, is governed by the rules in Part VII referred to in this Rule 1018.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 1018 is amended to include within its terms a petition commencing an ancillary case when it is contested. This provision was formerly included in Rule 1003(e)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although this rule does not contain an explicit authorization for the entry of an order for relief when a debtor refuses to cooperate in discovery relating to a contested involuntary petition, the court has ample power under Rule 37(b) F.R.Civ.P., as incorporated by Rule 7037, to enter an order for relief under appropriate circumstances. Rule 37(b) authorizes the court to enter judgment by default or an order that &ldquo;facts shall be taken as established.&rdquo;</p>
