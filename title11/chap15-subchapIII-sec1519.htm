<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) staying execution against the debtor's assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the debtor's assets located in the United States to the foreign representative or another person authorized by the court, including an examiner, in order to protect and preserve the value of assets that, by their nature or because of other circumstances, are perishable, susceptible to devaluation or otherwise in jeopardy; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Unless extended under section 1521(a)(6), the relief granted under this section terminates when the petition for recognition is granted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The standards, procedures, and limitations applicable to an injunction shall apply to relief under this section.</p>
