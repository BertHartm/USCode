I74legislative statements<p class="note-body">Section 902(2) of the Senate amendment is deleted since the bankruptcy court will have jurisdiction over all cases under chapter 9. The concept of a claim being materially and adversely affected reflected in section 902(1) of the Senate amendment has been deleted and replaced with the new concept of &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; set forth in section 1124 of the House amendment and incorporated by reference into chapter 9.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">senate report no. 95&ndash;989</h4>
<p class="note-body">There are six definitions for use in chapter 9. Paragraph (1) defines what claims are included in a chapter 9 case and adopts the definition now found in section 81(1) [section 401(1) of former title 11]. All claims against the petitioner generally will be included, with one significant exception. Municipalities are authorized, under section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended [title 26], to issue tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds to provide for the financing of certain projects for privately owned companies. The bonds are sold on the basis of the credit of the company on whose behalf they are issued, and the principal, interest, and premium, if any, are payable solely from payments made by the company to the trustee under the bond indenture and do not constitute claims on the tax revenues or other funds of the issuing municipalities. The municipality merely acts as the vehicle to enable the bonds to be issued on a tax-exempt basis. Claims that arise by virtue of these bonds are not among the claims defined by this paragraph and amounts owed by private companies to the holders of industrial development revenue bonds are not to be included among the assets of the municipality that would be affected by the plan. See Cong. Record, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. H.R. 12073 (statement by Mr. Don Edwards, floor manager of the bill in the House). Paragraph (2) defines the court which means the federal district court or federal district judge before which the case is pending. Paragraph (3) [enacted as (1)] specifies that when the term &ldquo;property of the estate&rdquo; is used in a section in another chapter made applicable in chapter 9 cases, the term means &ldquo;property of the debtor&rdquo;. Paragraphs (4) and (5) [enacted as (2) and (3)] adopt the definition of &ldquo;special taxpayer affected by the plan&rdquo; that appears in current sections 81(10) and 81(11) of the Bankruptcy Act [section 401(10) and (11) of former title 11]. Paragraph (6) [enacted as (4)] provides that &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; means &ldquo;debtor&rdquo; when used in conjunction with chapter 9.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">house report no. 95&ndash;595</h4>
<p class="note-body">There are only four definitions for use only in chapter 9. The first specifies that when the term &ldquo;property of the estate&rdquo; is used in a section in another chapter made applicable in chapter 9 cases, the term will mean &ldquo;property of the debtor&rdquo;. Paragraphs (2) and (3) adopt the definition of &ldquo;special taxpayer affected by the plan&rdquo; that appears in current sections 81(10) and 81(11) [section 401(10) and (11) of former title 11]. Paragraph (4) provides for &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; the same treatment as provided for &ldquo;property of the estate&rdquo;, specifying that it means &ldquo;debtor&rdquo; when used in conjunction with chapter 9.</p>
