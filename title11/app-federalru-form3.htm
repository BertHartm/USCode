<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This form is a &ldquo;document for filing&rdquo; that may be prepared by a &ldquo;bankruptcy petition preparer&rdquo; as defined in 11 U.S.C. &sect;110, which was added to the Code by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994; accordingly, a signature line is provided for such preparer. In addition to signing, a bankruptcy petition preparer is required by section 110 to disclose the information requested. A signature line for a debtor's attorney also is added, as required by Rule 9011.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The form has been reorganized and the paragraphs numbered. The debtor's certification concerning payment for services in the case has been placed ahead of the statement of proposed terms for installment payment of court fees. Acknowledgement by the debtor of the potential consequences of failure to pay any installment when due has been added. (See 11 U.S.C. &sect;707(a)(2).) The language of the form also has been changed to conform to Rule 1006 and to clarify that a debtor is not disqualified from paying the filing fee in installments because the debtor has paid money to a bankruptcy petition preparer.</p>
