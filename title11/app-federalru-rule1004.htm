<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">After filing of an involuntary petition under &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code, (1) the petitioning partners or other petitioners shall promptly send to or serve on each general partner who is not a petitioner a copy of the petition; and (2) the clerk shall promptly issue a summons for service on <!-- PDFPage:6 -->each general partner who is not a petitioner. Rule 1010 applies to the form and service of the summons.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 105 and complements &sect;&sect;301 and 303(b)(3) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> specifies that while all general partners must consent to the filing of a voluntary petition, it is not necessary that they all execute the petition. It may be executed and filed on behalf of the partnership by fewer than all.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> implements &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code which provides that an involuntary petition may be filed by fewer than all the general partners or, when all the general partners are debtors, by a general partner, trustee of the partner or creditors of the partnership. Rule 1010, which governs service of a petition and summons in an involuntary case, specifies the time and mode of service on the partnership. When a petition is filed against a partnership under &sect;303(b)(3), this rule requires an additional service on the nonfiling general partners. It is the purpose of this subdivision to protect the interests of the nonpetitioning partners and the partnership.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 303(b)(3)(A) of the Code provides that fewer than all of the general partners in a partnership may commence an involuntary case against the partnership. There is no counterpart provision in the Code setting out the manner in which a partnership commences a voluntary case. The Supreme Court has held in the corporate context that applicable nonbankruptcy law determines whether authority exists for a particular debtor to commence a bankruptcy case. <em>See Price v. Gurney</em>, 324 U.S. 100 (1945). The lower courts have followed this rule in the partnership context as well. <em>See, e.g., Jolly v. Pittore</em>, 170 B.R. 793 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); <em>Union Planters National Bank v. Hunters Horn Associates</em>, 158 B.R. 729 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1993); <em>In re Channel 64 Joint Venture</em>, 61 B.R. 255 (Bankr. S.D. Oh. 1986). Rule 1004(a) could be construed as requiring the consent of all of the general partners to the filing of a voluntary petition, even if fewer than all of the general partners would have the authority under applicable nonbankruptcy law to commence a bankruptcy case for the partnership. Since this is a matter of substantive law beyond the scope of these rules, Rule 1004(a) is deleted as is the designation of subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is retitled to reflect that it applies only to involuntary petitions filed against partnerships.</p>
