<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>. A patient care ombudsman, at least 14 days before making a report under &sect;333(b)(2) of the Code, shall give notice that the report will be made to the court, unless the court orders otherwise. The notice shall be transmitted to the United States trustee, posted conspicuously at the health care facility that is the subject of the report, and served on: the debtor; the trustee; all patients; and any committee elected under &sect;705 or appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code or its authorized agent, or, if the case is a chapter 9 municipality case or a chapter 11 reorganization case and no committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under &sect;1102, on the creditors included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d); and such other entities as the court may direct. The notice shall state the date and time when the report will be made, the manner in which the report will be made, and, if the report is in writing, the name, address, telephone number, email address, and website, if any, of the person from whom a copy of the report may be obtained at the debtor's expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authorization to Review Confidential Patient Records</cap-smallcap>. A motion by a patient care ombudsman under &sect;333(c) to review confidential patient records shall be governed by Rule 9014, served on the patient and any family member or other contact person whose name and address have been given to the trustee or the debtor for the purpose of providing information regarding the patient's health care, and transmitted to the United States trustee subject to applicable nonbankruptcy law relating to patient privacy. Unless the court orders otherwise, a hearing on the motion may not be commenced earlier than 14 days after service of the motion.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is new and implements &sect;333 of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments. Subdivision (a) is designed to give parties in interest, including patients or their representatives, sufficient notice so that they will be able to review written reports or attend hearings at which reports are made. The rule permits a notice to relate to a single report or to periodic reports to be given during the case. For example, the ombudsman may give notice that reports will be made at specified intervals or dates during the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) of the rule also requires that the notice be posted conspicuously at the health care facility in a place where it will be seen by patients and their families or others visiting the patients. This may require posting in common areas and patient rooms within the facility. Because health care facilities and the patients they serve can vary greatly, the locations of the posted notice should be tailored to the specific facility that is the subject of the report.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) requires the ombudsman to notify the patient and the United States trustee that the ombudsman is seeking access to confidential patient records so that they will be able to appear and be heard on the matter. This procedure should assist the court in reaching its decision both as to access to the records and appropriate restrictions on that access to ensure continued confidentiality. Notices given under this rule are subject to the provisions of applicable federal and state law that relate to the protection of patients&rsquo; privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104&ndash;191 (HIPAA).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. Two stylistic changes were made to the rule. The reference to the court's authority to order otherwise was moved from the beginning to the end of the first sentence of subdivision (a). On line 19, the word &ldquo;patient&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;health&rdquo; to be consistent with the Code.</p>
