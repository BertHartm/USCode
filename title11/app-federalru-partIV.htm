Relief from a stay under &sect;362(a) or a request to prohibit or condition the <!-- PDFPage:54 -->use, sale, or lease of property pursuant to &sect;363(e) may be granted without prior notice only if (A) it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by a verified motion that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party or the attorney for the adverse party can be heard in opposition, and (B) the movant's attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if any, which have been made to give notice and the reasons why notice should not be required.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Notice</em>. Notice of hearing pursuant to this subdivision shall be given to the parties on whom service of the motion is required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and to such other entities as the court may direct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Agreement Relating to Relief From the Automatic Stay, Prohibiting or Conditioning the Use, Sale, or Lease of Property, Providing Adequate Protection, Use of Case Collateral, and Obtaining Credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Motion; Service</em>.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule implements &sect;362 of the Code which set forth provisions regarding the automatic stay that arises on the filing of a petition. That section and this rule are applicable in chapters 7, 9, 11 and 13 cases. It also implements &sect;363(c)(2) concerning use of cash collateral.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> transforms with respect to the automatic stay what was an adversary proceeding under the former rules to motion practice. The Code provides automatic stays in several sections, <em>e.g</em>., &sect;&sect;362(a), 1301(a), and in &sect;362(d) provides some grounds for relief from the stay. This rule specifies that the pleading seeking relief is by means of a motion. Thus the time period in Rule 7012 to answer a complaint would not be applicable and shorter periods may be fixed. Section 362(e) requires the preliminary hearing to be concluded within 30 days of it inception, rendering ordinary complaint and answer practice inappropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision also makes clear that a motion under Rule 9014 is the proper procedure for a debtor to seek court permission to use cash collateral. See &sect;363(c)(2). Pursuant to Rule 5005, the motion should be filed in the court in which the case in pending. The court or local rule may specify the persons to be served with the motion for relief from the stay; see Rule 9013.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> of the rule fills a procedural void left by &sect;362. Pursuant to &sect;362(e), the automatic stay is terminated 30 days after a motion for relief is made unless the court continues the stay as a result of a final hearing or, pending final hearing, after a preliminary hearing. If a preliminary hearing is held, &sect;362(e) requires the final hearing to be commenced within 30 days after the preliminary hearing. Although the expressed legislative intent is to require expeditious resolution of a secured party's motion for relief, &sect;362 is silent as to the time within which the final hearing must be concluded. Subdivision (b) imposes a 30 day deadline on the court to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p class="note-body">At the final hearing, the stay is to be terminated, modified, annulled, or conditioned for cause, which includes, <em>inter alia</em>, lack of adequate protection; &sect;362(d). The burden of proving adequate protection is on the party opposing relief from the stay; &sect;362(g)(2). Adequate protection is exemplified in &sect;361.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> implements &sect;362(f) which permits ex parte relief from the stay when there will be irreparable damage. This subdivision sets forth the procedure to be followed when relief is sought under &sect;362(f). It is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 601(d).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The scope of this rule is expanded and the former subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) are now combined in subdivision (a). The new subdivision (a)(2) is amended to conform to the 1984 amendments to &sect;362(e) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> deals explicitly with the procedures which follow after a motion to use cash collateral is made and served. Filing shall be pursuant to Rule 5005. Service of the motion may be made by any method authorized by Rule 7004 and, if service is by mail, service is complete on mailing. Rule 9006(e). Under subdivision (b)(2), the court may commence a final hearing on the motion within 15 days of service. Rule 9006(f) does not extend this 15 day period when service of the motion is by mail because the party served is not required to act within the 15 day period. In addition to service of the motion, notice of the hearing must be given. Rule 9007 authorizes the court to direct the form and manner of giving notice that is appropriate to the circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 363(c)(3) authorizes the court to conduct a preliminary hearing and to authorize the use of cash collateral &ldquo;if there is a reasonable likelihood that the trustee will prevail at a final hearing.&rdquo; Subdivision (b)(2) of the rule permits a preliminary hearing to be held earlier than 15 days after service. Any order authorizing the use of cash collateral shall be limited to the amount necessary to protect the estate until a final hearing is held.</p>
<p class="note-body">The objective of subdivision (b) is to accommodate both the immediate need of the debtor and the interest of the secured creditor in the cash collateral. The time for holding the final hearing may be enlarged beyond the 15 days prescribed when required by the circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">The motion for authority to use cash collateral shall include (1) the amount of cash collateral sought to be used; (2) the name and address of each entity having an interest in the cash collateral; (3) the name and address of the entity in control or having possession of the cash collateral; (4) the facts demonstrating the need to use the cash collateral; and (5) the nature of the protection to be provided those having an interest in the cash collateral. If a preliminary hearing is requested, the motion shall also include the amount of cash collateral sought to be used pending final hearing and the protection to be provided.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notice of the preliminary and final hearings may be combined. This rule does not limit the authority of the court under &sect;363(c)(2)(B) and &sect;102(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is new. The service, hearing, and notice requirements are similar to those imposed by subdivision (b). The motion to obtain credit shall include the amount and type of the credit to be extended, the name and address of the lender, the terms of the agreement, the need to obtain the credit, and the efforts made to obtain credit from other sources. If the motion is to obtain credit pursuant to &sect;364(c) or (d), the motion shall describe the collateral, if any, and the protection for any existing interest in the collateral which may be affected by the proposed agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is new. In the event the 15 day period for filing objections to the approval of an agreement of the parties described in this subdivision is too long, the parties either may move for a reduction of the period under Rule 9006(c)(1) or proceed under subdivision (b) or (c), if applicable. Rule 9006(c)(1) requires that cause be shown for the reduction of the period in which to object. In applying this criterion the court may consider the option of proceeding under subdivision (b) or (c) and grant a preliminary hearing and relief pending final hearing.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is expanded to include a request to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property as is necessary to provide adequate protection of a property interest pursuant to &sect;363(e) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notice of the motion for relief from the automatic stay or to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property must be served on the entities entitled to receive notice of a motion to approve an agreement pursuant to subdivision (d). If the movant and the adverse party agree to settle the motion and the terms of the agreement do not materially differ from the terms set forth in the movant's motion papers, the court may approve the agreement without further notice pursuant to subdivision (d)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(2)</em> is deleted as unnecessary because of &sect;362(e) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1)</em> are amended to require service on committees that are elected in chapter 7 cases. Service on committees of retired employees appointed under &sect;1114 of the Code is not required. These subdivisions are amended further to clarify that, in the absence of a creditors&rsquo; committee, service on the creditors included on the list filed pursuant to Rule 1007(d) is required only in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. The other amendments to subdivision (d)(1) are for consistency of style and are not substantive.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(4)</em> is added to avoid the necessity of further notice and delay for the approval of an agree<!-- PDFPage:56 -->ment in settlement of a motion for relief from an automatic stay, to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property, for use of cash collateral, or for authority to obtain credit if the entities entitled to notice have already received sufficient notice of the scope of the proposed agreement in the motion papers and have had an opportunity to be heard. For example, if a trustee makes a motion to use cash collateral and proposes in the original motion papers to provide adequate protection of the interest of the secured party by granting a lien on certain equipment, and the secured creditor subsequently agrees to terms that are within the scope of those proposed in the motion, the court may enter an order approving the agreement without further notice if the entities that received the original motion papers have had a reasonable opportunity to object to the granting of the motion to use cash collateral.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the motion papers served under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) do not afford notice sufficient to inform the recipients of the material provisions of the proposed agreement and opportunity for a hearing, approval of the settlement agreement may not be obtained unless the procedural requirements of subdivision (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) are satisfied. If the 15 day period for filing objections to the approval of the settlement agreement is too long under the particular circumstances of the case, the court may shorten the time for cause under Rule 9006(c)(1).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (a)(3)</em> is added to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order granting relief from an automatic stay before the order is enforced or implemented. The stay under paragraph (a)(3) is not applicable to orders granted ex parte in accordance with Rule 4001(a)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The stay of the order does not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal in accordance with Rule 8002. While the enforcement and implementation of an order granting relief from the automatic stay is temporarily stayed under paragraph (a)(3), the automatic stay continues to protect the debtor, and the moving party may not foreclose on collateral or take any other steps that would violate the automatic stay.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may, in its discretion, order that Rule 4001(a)(3) is not applicable so that the prevailing party may immediately enforce and implement the order granting relief from the automatic stay. Alternatively, the court may order that the stay under Rule 4001(a)(3) is for a fixed period less than 10 days.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 4003. Exemptions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Claim of Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A debtor shall list the property claimed as exempt under &sect;522 of the Code on the schedule of assets required to be filed by Rule 1007. If the debtor fails to claim exemptions or file the schedule within the time specified in Rule 1007, a dependent of the debtor may file the list within 30 days thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objecting to a Claim of Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as exempt only within 30 days after the meeting of creditors held under &sect;341(a) is concluded or within 30 days after any amendment to the list or supplemental schedules is filed, whichever is later. The court may, for cause, extend the time for filing objections if, before the time to object expires, a party in interest files a request for an extension. Copies of the objections shall be delivered or mailed to the trustee, the person filing the list, and the attorney for that person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Burden of Proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any hearing under this rule, the objecting party has the burden of proving that the exemptions are not properly claimed. After hearing on notice, the court shall determine the issues presented by the objections.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Avoidance by Debtor of Transfers of Exempt Property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proceeding by the debtor to avoid a lien or other transfer of property exempt under &sect;522(f) of the Code shall be by motion in accordance with Rule 9014.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from &sect;522(1) of the Code and, in part, former Bankruptcy Rule 403. The Code changes the thrust of that rule by making it the burden of the debtor to list his exemptions and the burden of parties in interest to raise objections in the absence of which &ldquo;the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt;&rdquo; &sect;522(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. While &sect;522(1) refers to a list of property claimed as exempt, the rule incorporates such a list as part of Official Form No. 6, the schedule of the debtor's assets, rather than requiring a separate list and filing. Rule 1007, to which subdivision (a) refers, requires that schedule to be filed within 15 days after the order for relief, unless the court extends the time.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 522(1) also provides that a dependent of the debtor may file the list if the debtor fails to do so. Subdivision (a) of the rule allows such filing from the expiration of the debtor's time until 30 days thereafter. Dependent is defined in &sect;522(a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> provides that a proceeding by the debtor, permitted by &sect;522(f) of the Code, is a contested matter rather than the more formal adversary proceeding. Proceedings within the scope of this subdivision are <!-- PDFPage:57 -->distinguished from proceedings brought by the trustee to avoid transfers. The latter are classified as adversary proceedings by Rule 7001.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to facilitate the filing of objections to exemptions claimed on a supplemental schedule filed under Rule 1007(h).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely request for an extension of time to file objections to the list of claimed exemptions, whether the court rules on the request before or after the expiration of the 30-day period. The purpose of this amendment is to avoid the harshness of the present rule which has been construed to deprive a bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to grant a timely request for an extension if it has failed to rule on the request within the 30-day period. See <em>In re Laurain</em>, 113 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 1997), <em>Matter of Stoulig</em>, 45 F.3d 957 (5th Cir. 1995), <em>In re Brayshaw</em>, 912 F.2d 1255 (10th Cir. 1990). The amendments clarify that the extension may be granted only for cause. The amendments also conform the rule to &sect;522(<em>l</em>) of the Code by recognizing that any party in interest may file an objection or request for an extension of time under this rule. Other amendments are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4003(b)</em>. The words &ldquo;trustee or creditor&rdquo; were replaced by &ldquo;party in interest&rdquo; to conform to &sect;522(<em>l</em>) of the Bankruptcy Code which permits any party in interest to object to claimed exemptions. Style revisions also were made to the published draft.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 404.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> of this rule prescribe the procedure for determining whether a discharge will be granted pursuant to &sect;727 of the Code. The time fixed by subdivision (a) may be enlarged as provided in subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice referred to in subdivision (a) is required to be given by mail and addressed to creditors as provided in Rule 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body">An extension granted on a motion pursuant to subdivision (b) of the rule would ordinarily benefit only the movant, but its scope and effect would depend on the terms of the extension.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. If a complaint objecting to discharge is filed, the court's grant or denial of the discharge will be entered at the conclusion of the proceeding as a judgment in accordance with Rule 9021. The inclusion of the clause in subdivision (c) qualifying the duty of the court to grant a discharge when a waiver has been filed is in accord with the construction of the Code. 4 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;727.12 (15th ed. 1979).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (c) takes cognizance of &sect;524(c) of the Code which authorizes a debtor to enter into enforceable reaffirmation agreements only prior to entry of the order of discharge. Immediate entry of that order after expiration of the time fixed for filing complaints objecting to discharge may render it more difficult for a debtor to settle pending litigation to determine the dischargeability of a debt and execute a reaffirmation agreement as part of a settlement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. An objection to discharge is required to be made by a complaint, which initiates an adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003. Pursuant to <!-- PDFPage:58 -->Rule 5005, the complaint should be filed in the court in which the case is pending.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Official Form No. 27 to which subdivision (e) refers, includes notice of the effects of a discharge specified in &sect;524(a) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. Registration may facilitate the enforcement of the order of discharge in a district other than that in which it was entered. See 2 Moore's <em>Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;1.04[2] (2d ed. 1967). Because of the nationwide service of process authorized by Rule 7004, however, registration of the order of discharge is not necessary under these rules to enable a discharged debtor to obtain relief against a creditor proceeding anywhere in the United States in disregard of the injunctive provisions of the order of discharge.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. Notice of discharge should be mailed promptly after the order becomes final so that creditors may be informed of entry of the order and of its injunctive provisions. Rule 2002 specifies the manner of the notice and persons to whom the notice is to be given.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to conform to &sect;727(c) which gives the United States trustee the right to object to discharge. This amendment is derived from Rule X&ndash;1008(a)(1) and is consistent with Rule 2002. The amendment to subdivision (c) is to prevent a timely motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse from becoming moot merely because a discharge order has been entered. Reference to the Official Form number in subdivision (e) is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subsection (c)</em> is amended to delay entry of the order of discharge if a motion pursuant to Rule 4004(b) to extend the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge is pending. Also, this subdivision is amended to delay entry of the discharge order if the debtor has not paid in full the filing fee and the administrative fee required to be paid upon the commencement of the case. If the debtor is authorized to pay the fees in installments in accordance with Rule 1006, the discharge order will not be entered until the final installment has been paid.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4004</em>. No changes have been made since publication, except for stylistic changes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to clarify that, in a chapter 7 case, the deadline for filing a complaint objecting to discharge under &sect;727(a) is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors, whether or not the meeting is held on that date. The time for filing the complaint is not affected by any delay in the commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors. This amendment does not affect the right of any party in interest to file a motion for an extension of time to file a complaint objecting to discharge in accordance with Rule 4004(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The substitution of the word &ldquo;filed&rdquo; for &ldquo;made&rdquo; in subdivision (b) is intended to avoid confusion regarding the time when a motion is &ldquo;made&rdquo; for the purpose of applying these rules. <em>See, e.g., In re Coggin</em>, 30 F.3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, this rule requires that a motion for an extension of time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge be <em>filed</em> before the time has expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4004</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended so that a discharge will not be granted while a motion requesting an extension of time to file a motion to dismiss the case under &sect;707(b) is pending. Other amendments are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4004(c)</em>. No changes since publication except for style revisions.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule does not address the burden of going forward with the evidence. Subject to the allocation by the rule of the initial burden of producing evidence and the ultimate burden of persuasion, the rule leaves to the courts the formulation of rules governing the shift of the burden of going forward with the evidence in the light of considerations such as the difficulty of proving the nonexistence of a fact and of establishing a fact as to which the evidence is likely to be more accessible to the debtor than to the objector. <em>See, e.g., In re Haggerty</em>, 165 F.2d 977, 979&ndash;80 (2d Cir. 1948); <em>Federal Provision Co. v. Ershowsky</em>, 94 F.2d 574, 575 (2d Cir. 1938); <em>In re Riceputo</em>, 41 F. Supp. 926, 927&ndash;28 (E.D.N.Y. 1941).</p>

<p class="note-body">The suspension by &sect;108(c) of the Code of the statute of limitations affecting any debt of a debtor terminates within 30 days after the debtor is denied a discharge or otherwise loses his right to a discharge. If, however, a debtor's failure to receive a discharge does not come to the attention of his creditors until after the statutes of limitations have run, the debtor obtains substantially the same benefits from his bankruptcy as a debtor who is discharged.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule requires the clerk to notify creditors if a debtor fails to obtain a discharge because a waiver of discharge was filed under &sect;727(a)(10) or as a result of an order denying or revoking the discharge under &sect;727(a) or (d).</p>
