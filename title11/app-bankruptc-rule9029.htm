<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Each district court by action of a majority of the judges thereof may make and amend rules governing practice and procedure in all cases and proceedings within the district court's bankruptcy jurisdiction which are not inconsistent with these rules and which do not prohibit or limit the use of Official Forms. Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. governs the procedure for making local rules. A district court may authorize the bankruptcy judges of the district, subject to any limitation or condition it may prescribe and the requirements of 83 F.R.Civ.P., to make rules of practice and procedure which are not inconsistent with these rules and which do not prohibit or limit the use of Official Forms. In all cases not provided for by rule, the court may regulate its practice in any manner not inconsistent with the Official Forms or with these rules or those of the district in which the court acts.</p>
