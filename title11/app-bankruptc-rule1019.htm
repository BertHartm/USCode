<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">When a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case has been converted or reconverted to a chapter 7 case:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Filing of Lists, Inventories, Schedules, Statements.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Lists, inventories, schedules, and statements of financial affairs theretofore filed shall be deemed to be filed in the chapter 7 case, unless the court directs otherwise. If they have not been previously filed, the debtor shall comply with Rule 1007 as if an order for relief had been entered on an involuntary petition on the date of the entry of the order directing that the case continue under chapter 7.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The statement of intention, if required, shall be filed within 30 days following entry of the order of conversion or before the first date set for the meeting of creditors, whichever is earlier. An extension of time may be granted for cause only on motion made before the time has expired. Notice of an extension shall be given to the United States trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as the court may direct.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>New Filing Periods.</em> A new time period for filing claims, a complaint objecting to discharge, or a complaint to obtain a determination of dischargeability of any debt shall commence pursuant to Rules 3002, 4004, or 4007, provided that a new time period shall not commence if a chapter 7 case had been converted to a chapter 11, 12, or 13 case and thereafter reconverted to a chapter 7 case and the time for filing claims, a complaint objecting to discharge, or a complaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of any debt, or any extension thereof, expired in the original chapter 7 case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Claims Filed in Superseded Case.</em> All claims actually filed by a creditor in the superseded case shall be deemed filed in the chapter 7 case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Turnover of Records and Property.</em> After qualification of, or assumption of duties by the chapter 7 trustee, any debtor in possession or trustee previously acting in the chapter 11, 12, or 13 case shall, forthwith, unless otherwise ordered, turn over to the chapter 7 trustee all records and property of the estate in the possession or control of the debtor in possession or trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <em>Filing Final Report and Schedule of Postpetition Debts.</em> Unless the court directs otherwise, each debtor in possession or trustee in the superseded case shall: (A) within 15 days following the entry of the order of conversion of a chapter 11 case, file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred after commencement of the superseded case including the name and address of each creditor; and (B) within 30 days following the entry of the order of conversion of a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case, file and transmit to the United States trustee a final report and account. Within 15 days following the entry of the order of conversion, unless the court directs otherwise, a chapter 13 debtor shall file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred after the commencement of a chapter 13 case, and a chapter 12 debtor in possession or, if the chapter 12 debtor is not in possession, the trustee shall file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred after the commencement of a chapter 12 case. If the conversion order is entered after confirmation of a plan, the debtor shall file (A) a schedule of property not listed in the final report and account acquired after the filing of the original petition but before entry of the conversion order; (B) a schedule of unpaid debts not listed in the final report and account incurred after confirmation but before entry of the conversion order; and (C) a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases entered into or assumed after the filing of the original petition but before entry of the conversion order. The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every schedule filed pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <em>Filing of Postpetition Claims; Notice.</em> On the filing of the schedule of unpaid debts, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give notice to those entities, including the United States, any state, or any subdivision thereof, that their claims may be filed pursuant to Rules 3001(a)&ndash;(d) and 3002. Unless a notice of insufficient assets to pay a dividend is mailed pursuant to Rule 2002(e), the court shall fix the time for filing claims arising from the rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases under &sect;&sect;348(c) and 365(d) of the Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <em>Extension of Time to File Claims Against Surplus.</em> Any extension of time for the filing of claims against a surplus granted pursuant to <!-- PDFPage:16 -->Rule 3002(c)(6), shall apply to holders of claims who failed to file their claims within the time prescribed, or fixed by the court pursuant to paragraph (6) of this rule, and notice shall be given as provided in Rule 2002.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 122 and implements &sect;348 of the Code. The rule applies to proceedings in a chapter 7 case following supersession of a case commenced under chapter 11 or 13, whether the latter was initiated by an original petition or was converted from a pending chapter 7 or another chapter case. The rule is not intended to invalidate any action taken in the superseded case before its conversion to chapter 7.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1):</em> If requirements applicable in the superseded case respecting the filing of schedules of debts and property, or lists of creditors and inventory, and of statements of financial affairs have been complied with before the order directing conversion to liquidation, these documents will ordinarily provide all the information about the debts, property, financial affairs, and contracts of the debtor needed for the administration of the estate. If the information submitted in the superseded case is inadequate for the purposes of administration, however, the court may direct the preparation of further informational material and the manner and time of its submission pursuant to paragraph (1). If no schedules, lists, inventories, or statements were filed in the superseded case, this paragraph imposes the duty on the debtor to file schedules and a statement of affairs pursuant to Rule 1007 as if an involuntary petition had been filed on the date when the court directed the conversion of the case to a liquidation case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraphs (2) and (3).</em> Paragraph (2) requires notice to be given to all creditors of the order of conversion. The notice is to be included in the notice of the meeting of creditors and Official Form No. 16 may be adapted for use. A meeting of creditors may have been held in the superseded case as required by &sect;341(a) of the Code but that would not dispense with the need to hold one in the ensuing liquidation case. Section 701(a) of the Code permits the court to appoint the trustee acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case as interim trustee in the chapter 7 case. Section 702(a) of the Code allows creditors to elect a trustee but only at the meeting of creditors held under &sect;341. The right to elect a trustee is not lost because the chapter 7 case follows a chapter 11 or 13 case. Thus a meeting of creditors is necessary. The date fixed for the meeting of creditors will control at least the time for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c). That time will remain applicable in the ensuing chapter 7 case except as paragraph (3) provides, if that time had expired in an earlier chapter 7 case which was converted to the chapter 11 or 13 case, it is not revived in the subsequent chapter 7 case. The same is true if the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge or to determine nondischargeability of a debt had expired. Paragraph (3), however, recognizes that such time may be extended by the court under Rule 4004 or 4007 on motion made within the original prescribed time.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em> renders it unnecessary to file anew claims that had been filed in the chapter 11 or 13 case before conversion to chapter 7.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (5)</em> contemplates that typically, after the court orders conversion of a chapter case to liquidation, a trustee under chapter 7 will forthwith take charge of the property of the estate and proceed expeditiously to liquidate it. The court may appoint the interim trustee in the chapter 7 case pursuant to &sect;701(a) of the Code. If creditors do not elect a trustee under &sect;702, the interim trustee becomes the trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em> requires the trustee or debtor in possession acting in the chapter 11 or 13 case to file a final report and schedule of debts incurred in that case. This schedule will provide the information necessary for giving the notice required by paragraph (7) of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (7)</em> requires that claims that arose in the chapter 11 or 13 case be filed within 60 days after entry of the order converting the case to one under chapter 7. Claims not scheduled pursuant to paragraph (6) of the rule or arising from the rejection of an executory contract entered into during the chapter case may be filed within a time fixed by the court. Pursuant to &sect;348(c) of the Code, the conversion order is treated as the order for relief to fix the time for the trustee to assume or reject executory contracts under &sect;365(d).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (8)</em> permits the extension of the time for filing claims when claims are not timely filed but only with respect to any surplus that may remain in the estate. See also &sect;726(a)(2)(C) and (3) of the Code.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)</em> is amended to provide for the filing of a statement of intention in a case converted to chapter 7. Paragraph (1)(B) is added to provide for the filing of the statement of intention when a case is converted to chapter 7. The time for filing the statement of intention and for an extension of that time is governed by &sect;521(2)(A) of the Code. An extension of time for other required filings is governed by Rule 1007(c), which paragraph (1)(A) incorporates by reference. Because of the amendment to Rule 1007(c), the filing of new lists, schedules, and statements is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (3)</em> of the rule is expanded to include the effect of conversion of a chapter 11 or 13 case to a chapter 7 case. On conversion of a case from chapter 11 or 13 to a chapter 7 case, parties have a new period within which to file claims or complaints relating to the granting of the discharge or the dischargeability of a debt. This amendment is consistent with the holding and reasoning of the court in <em>F & M Marquette Nat'l Bank v. Richards</em>, 780 F.2d 24 (8th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (4)</em> is amended to deal directly with the status of claims which are properly listed on the schedules filed in a chapter 11 case and deemed filed pursuant to &sect;1111(a) of the Code. Section 1111(a) is only applicable to the chapter 11 case. On conversion of the chapter 11 case to a chapter 7 case, paragraph (4) governs the status of claims filed in the chapter 11 case. The Third Circuit properly construed paragraph (4) as applicable to claims deemed filed in the superseded chapter 11 case. <em>In re Crouthamel Potato Chip Co</em>., 786 F.2d 141 (3d Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to paragraph (4) changes that result by providing that only claims that are actually filed in the chapter 11 case are treated as filed in the superseding chapter 7 case. When chapter 11 cases are converted to chapter 7 cases, difficulties in obtaining and verifying the debtors&rsquo; records are common. It is unfair to the chapter 7 trustee and creditors to require that they be bound by schedules which may not be subject to verification.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em> is amended to place the obligation on the chapter 13 debtor to file a schedule of unpaid debts incurred during the superseded chapter 13 case.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to include conversion of a case from chapter 12 to chapter 7 and to implement the United States trustee system.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to paragraph (1)(A) are stylistic. Reference to the statement of executory contracts is deleted to conform to the amendment to Rule 1007(b)(1) which changes the statement to a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (1)(B)</em> is amended to enable the United States trustee to monitor the progress of the case and to take appropriate action to enforce the debtor's obligation to perform the statement of intention in a timely manner.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:17 --><p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (2)</em> is deleted because notice of conversion of the case is required by Rules 1017(d), 2002(f)(2), and 9022. The United States trustee, who supervises trustees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a), may give notice of the conversion to the trustee in the superseded case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (6)</em>, renumbered as paragraph (5), is amended to reduce to 15 days the time for filing a schedule of postpetition debts and requires inclusion of the name and address of each creditor in connection with the postpetition debt. These changes will enable the clerk to send postpetition creditors a timely notice of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to &sect;341(a) of the Code. The amendments to this paragraph also provide the United States trustee with the final report and account of the superseded case, and with a copy of every schedule filed after conversion of the case. Conversion to chapter 7 terminates the service of the trustee in the superseded case pursuant to &sect;348(e) of the Code. Sections 704(a)(9), 1106(a)(1), 1107(a), 1202(b)(1), 1203 and 1302(b)(1) of the Code require the trustee or debtor in possession to file a final report and account with the court and the United States trustee. The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (7)</em>, renumbered as paragraph (6), is amended to conform the time for filing postpetition claims to the time for filing prepetition claims pursuant to paragraph (3) (renumbered as paragraph (2)) of this rule and Rule 3002(c). This paragraph is also amended to eliminate the need for a court order to provide notice of the time for filing claims. It is anticipated that this notice will be given together with the notice of the meeting of creditors. It is amended further to avoid the need to fix a time for filing claims arising under &sect;365(d) if it is a no asset case upon conversion. If assets become available for distribution, the court may fix a time for filing such claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">The additions of references to unexpired leases in paragraph (1)(A) and in paragraphs (6) and (7) (renumbered as paragraphs (5) and (6)) are technical amendments to clarify that unexpired leases are included as well as other executory contracts.</p>
