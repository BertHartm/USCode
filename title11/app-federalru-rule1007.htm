In a chapter 11 reorganization case, unless the court orders otherwise, the debtor shall file within 15 days after <!-- PDFPage:7 -->entry of the order for relief a list of the debtor's equity security holders of each class showing the number and kind of interests registered in the name of each holder, and the last known address or place of business of each holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Extension of Time</em>. Any extension of time for the filing of the lists required by this subdivision may be granted only on motion for cause shown and on notice to the United States trustee and to any trustee, committee elected pursuant to &sect;705 or appointed pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code, or other party as the court may direct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Schedules and Statements Required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except in a chapter 9 municipality case, the debtor, unless the court orders otherwise, shall file schedules of assets and liabilities, a schedule of current income and expenditures, a schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases, and a statement of financial affairs, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Forms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual debtor in a chapter 7 case shall file a statement of intention as required by &sect;521(2) of the Code, prepared as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. A copy of the statement of intention shall be served on the trustee and the creditors named in the statement on or before the filing of the statement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Time Limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The schedules and statements, other than the statement of intention, shall be filed with the petition in a voluntary case, or if the petition is accompanied by a list of all the debtor's creditors and their addresses, within 15 days thereafter, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (d), (e), and (h) of this rule. In an involuntary case the schedules and statements, other than the statement of intention, shall be filed by the debtor within 15 days after entry of the order for relief. Schedules and statements filed prior to the conversion of a case to another chapter shall be deemed filed in the converted case unless the court directs otherwise.

Notice of an extension shall be given to the United States trustee and to any committee, trustee, or other party as the court may direct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) List of 20 Largest Creditors in Chapter 9 Municipality Case or Chapter 11 Reorganization Case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the list required by subdivision (a) of this rule, a debtor in a chapter 9 municipality case or a debtor in a voluntary chapter 11 reorganization case shall file with the petition a list containing the name, address and claim of the creditors that hold the 20 largest unsecured claims, excluding insiders, as prescribed by the appropriate Official Form. In an involuntary chapter 11 reorganization case, such list shall be filed by the debtor within 2 days after entry of the order for relief under &sect;303(h) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) List in Chapter 9 Municipality Cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The list required by subdivision (a) of this rule shall be filed by the debtor in a chapter 9 municipality case within such time as the court shall fix. If a proposed plan requires a revision of assessments so that the proportion of special assessments or special taxes to be assessed against some real property will be different from the proportion in effect at the date the petition is filed, the debtor shall also file a list showing the name and address of each known holder of title, legal or equitable, to real property adversely affected. On motion for cause shown, the court may modify the requirements of this subdivision and subdivision (a) of this rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) [Abrogated]</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Partnership and Partners</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The general partners of a debtor partnership shall prepare and file the schedules of the assets and liabilities, schedule of current income and expenditures, schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases, and statement of financial affairs of the partnership. The court may order any general partner to file a statement of personal assets and liabilities within such time as the court may fix.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Interests Acquired or Arising After Petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, as provided by &sect;541(a)(5) of the Code, the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire any interest in property, the debtor shall within 10 days after the information comes to the debtor's knowledge or within such further time the court may allow, file a supplemental schedule in the chapter 7 liquidation case, chapter 11 reorganization case, chapter 12 family farmer's debt adjustment case, or chapter 13 individual debt adjustment case. If any of the property required to be reported under this subdivision is claimed by the debtor as exempt, the debtor shall claim the exemptions in the supplemental schedule. The duty to file a supplemental schedule in accordance with this subdivision continues notwithstanding the closing of the case, except that the schedule need not be filed in a chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 case with respect to property acquired after entry of the order confirming a chapter 11 plan or discharging the debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Disclosure of List of Security Holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After notice and hearing and for cause shown, the court may direct an entity other than the debtor or trustee to disclose any list of security holders of the debtor in its possession or under its control, indicating the name, address and security held by any of them. The entity possessing this list may be required either to produce the list or a true copy thereof, or permit inspection or copying, or otherwise disclose the information contained on the list.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Impounding of Lists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion of a party in interest and for cause shown the court may direct the impounding of the lists filed under this rule, and may refuse to permit inspection by any entity.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Preparation of List, Schedules, or Statements on Default of Debtor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a list, schedule, or statement, other than a statement of intention, is not prepared and filed <!-- PDFPage:8 -->as required by this rule, the court may order the trustee, a petitioning creditor, committee, or other party to prepare and file any of these papers within a time fixed by the court. The court may approve reimbursement of the cost incurred in complying with such an order as an administrative expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Transmission to United States Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the United States trustee a copy of every list, schedule, and statement filed pursuant to subdivision (a)(1), (a)(2), (b), (d), or (h) of this rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Infants and Incompetent Persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the debtor knows that a person on the list of creditors or schedules is an infant or incompetent person, the debtor also shall include the name, address, and legal relationship of any person upon whom process would be served in an adversary proceeding against the infant or incompetent person in accordance with Rule 7004(b)(2).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is an adaptation of former Rules 108, 8&ndash;106, 10&ndash;108 and 11&ndash;11. As specified in the rule, it is applicable in all types of cases filed under the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> requires at least a list of creditors with their names and addresses to be filed with the petition. This list is needed for notice of the meeting of creditors (Rule 2002) and notice of the order for relief (&sect;342 of the Code). The list will also serve to meet the requirements of &sect;521(1) of the Code. Subdivision (a) recognizes that it may be impossible to file the schedules required by &sect;521(1) and subdivision (b) of the rule at the time the petition is filed but in order for the case to proceed expeditiously and efficiently it is necessary that the clerk have the names and addresses of creditors. It should be noted that subdivision (d) of the rule requires a special list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors in chapter 9 and 11 cases. That list is for the purpose of selecting a committee of unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from former Rule 11&ndash;11 and conforms with &sect;521. This subdivision indicates the forms to be used. The court may dispense with the filing of schedules and the statement of affairs pursuant to &sect;521.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (c) and (f)</em> specify the time periods for filing the papers required by the rule as well as the number of copies. The provisions dealing with an involuntary case are derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108. Under the Code, a chapter 11 case may be commenced by an involuntary petition (&sect;303(a)), whereas under the Act, a Chapter XI case could have been commenced only by a voluntary petition. A motion for an extension of time to file the schedules and statements is required to be made on notice to parties, as the court may direct, including a creditors&rsquo; committee if one has been appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code and a trustee or examiner if one has been appointed pursuant to &sect;1104 of the Code. Although written notice is preferable, it is not required by the rule; in proper circumstances the notice may be by telephone or otherwise.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is new and requires that a list of the 20 largest unsecured creditors, excluding insiders as defined in &sect;101(25) of the Code, be filed with the petition. The court, pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code, is required to appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after the order for relief. That committee generally is to consist of the seven largest unsecured creditors who are willing to serve. The list should, as indicated on Official Form No. 9, specify the nature and amount of the claim. It is important for the court to be aware of the different types of claims existing in the case and this form should supply such information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> applies only in chapter 9 municipality cases. It gives greater discretion to the court to determine the time for filing a list of creditors and any other matter related to the list. A list of creditors must at some point be filed since one is required by &sect;924 of the Code. When the plan affects special assessments, the definitions in &sect;902(2) and (3) for &ldquo;special tax payer&rdquo; and &ldquo;special tax payer affected by the plan&rdquo; become relevant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> is derived from former Rules 108(c) and 11&ndash;11. Nondebtor general partners are liable to the partnership's trustee for any deficiency in the partnership's estate to pay creditors in full as provided by &sect;723 of the Code. Subdivision (g) authorizes the court to require a partner to file a statement of personal assets and liabilities to provide the trustee with the relevant information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 108(e) for chapter 7, 11 and 13 purposes. It implements the provisions in and language of &sect;541(a)(5) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (i) and (j)</em> are adapted from &sect;&sect;165 and 166 of the Act and former Rule 10&ndash;108(b) and (c) without change in substance. The term &ldquo;party in interest&rdquo; is not defined in the Code or the rules, but reference may be made to &sect;1109(b) of the Code. In the context of this subdivision, the term would include the debtor, the trustee, any indenture trustee, creditor, equity security holder or committee appointed pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (k)</em> is derived from former Rules 108(d) and 10&ndash;108(a).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b), (c), and (g)</em> are amended to provide for the filing of a schedule of current income and current expenditures and the individual debtor's statement of intention. These documents are required by the 1984 amendments to &sect;521 of the Code. Official Form No. 6A is prescribed for use by an individual debtor for filing a schedule of current income and current expenditures in a chapter 7 or chapter 11 case. Although a partnership or corporation is also required by &sect;521(1) to file a schedule of current income and current expenditures, no Official Form is prescribed therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">The time for filing the statement of intention is governed by &sect;521(2)(A). A copy of the statement of intention must be served on the trustee and the creditors named in the statement within the same time. The provisions of subdivision (c) governing the time for filing when a chapter 11 or chapter 13 case is converted to a chapter 7 case have been omitted from subdivision (c) as amended. Filing after conversion is now governed exclusively by Rule 1019.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em> has been abrogated. The number of copies of the documents required by this rule will be determined by local rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em> is amended to include a direct reference to &sect;541(a)(5).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (k)</em> provides that the court may not order an entity other than the debtor to prepare and file the statement of intention.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">References to Official Form numbers and to the Chapter 13 Statement are deleted and subdivision (b) is amended in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms. The debtor in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case shall file the list, schedules and statements required in subdivisions (a)(1), (b)(1), and (h). It is expected that the information currently provided in the Chapter 13 Statement will be included in the schedules and statements as revised not later than the effective date of these rule amendments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c)</em> are amended to provide the United States trustee with notice of any motion to ex<!-- PDFPage:9 -->tend the time for the filing of any lists, schedules, or statements. Such notice enables the United States trustee to take appropriate steps to avoid undue delay in the administration of the case. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(G). Subdivisions (a)(4) and (c) are amended further to provide notice to committees elected under &sect;705 or appointed pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code. Committees of retired employees appointed pursuant to &sect;1114 are not included.</p>
<p class="note-body">The additions of references to unexpired leases in subdivisions (b)(1) and (g) indicate that the schedule requires the inclusion of unexpired leases as well as other executory contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; in subdivisions (b)(1), (e), and (g) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (l)</em>, which is derived from Rule X&ndash;1002(a), provides the United States trustee with the information required to perform certain administrative duties such as the appointment of a committee of unsecured creditors. In a chapter 7 case, the United States trustee should be aware of the debtor's intention with respect to collateral that secures a consumer debt so that the United States trustee may monitor the progress of the case. Pursuant to &sect;307 of the Code, the United States trustee has standing to raise, appear and be heard on issues and the lists, schedules and statements contain information that, when provided to the United States trustee, enable that office to participate effectively in the case. The United States trustee has standing to move to dismiss a chapter 7 or 13 case for failure to file timely the list, schedules or statement required by &sect;521(1) of the Code. See &sect;&sect;707(a)(3) and 1307(c)(9). It is therefore necessary for the United States trustee to receive notice of any extension of time to file such documents. Upon request, the United States trustee also may receive from the trustee or debtor in possession a list of equity security holders.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to provide that schedules and statements filed prior to the conversion of a case to another chapter shall be deemed filed in the converted case, whether or not the case was a chapter 7 case prior to conversion. This amendment is in recognition of the 1991 amendments to the Official Forms that abrogated the Chapter 13 Statement and made the same forms for schedules and statements applicable in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision also contains a technical correction. The phrase &ldquo;superseded case&rdquo; creates the erroneous impression that conversion of a case results in a new case that is distinct from the original case. The effect of conversion of a case is governed by &sect;348 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 1007(c)</em>. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2001 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (m)</em> is added to enable the person required to mail notices under Rule 2002 to mail them to the appropriate guardian or other representative when the debtor knows that a creditor or other person listed is an infant or incompetent person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proper mailing address of the representative is determined in accordance with Rule 7004(b)(2), which requires mailing to the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode or at the place where the person regularly conducts a business or profession.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. No changes were made.</p>
