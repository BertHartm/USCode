<h3 class="section-head">Rule 8001. Manner of Taking Appeal; Voluntary Dismissal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Appeal as of Right; How Taken</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An appeal from a final judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy judge to a district court or bankruptcy appellate panel shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002. Failure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal. The notice of appeal shall conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form, shall contain the names of all parties to the judgment, order, or decree appealed from and the names, addresses and telephone numbers of their respective attorneys, and be accompanied by the prescribed fee. Each appellant shall file a sufficient number of copies of the notice of appeal to enable the clerk to comply promptly with Rule 8004.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appeal by Leave; How Taken</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order or decree of a bankruptcy judge as permitted by 28 U.S.C. &sect;158(a) shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal, as prescribed in subdivision (a) of this rule, accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal prepared in accordance with Rule 8003 and with proof of service in accordance with Rule 8008.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Voluntary Dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Before Docketing</em>. If an appeal has not been docketed, the appeal may be dismissed by the bankruptcy judge on the filing of a stipulation for dismissal signed by all the parties, or on motion and notice by the appellant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>After Docketing</em>. If an appeal has been docketed and the parties to the appeal sign and file with the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel an agreement that the appeal be dismissed and pay any court costs or fees that may be due, the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel shall enter an order dismissing the appeal. An appeal may also be dismissed on motion of the appellant on terms and conditions fixed by the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">[(d) Effect of Taking a Direct Appeal to the Court of Appeals] (Abrogated Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987)</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consent To Appeal to Bankruptcy Appellate Panel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless otherwise provided by a rule promulgated pursuant to Rule 8018, consent to have an appeal heard by a bankruptcy appellate panel may be given in a separate statement of consent executed by a party or contained in the notice of appeal or cross appeal. The statement of consent shall be filed before the transmittal of the record pursuant to Rule 8007(b) or within 30 days of the filing of the notice of appeal, whichever is later.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">These rules in Part VIII apply only to appeals to the district courts or bankruptcy appellate panels. Subsequent appeals to the courts of appeals, or direct appeals by agreement of the parties under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1293(b), are governed by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> require that a notice of appeal be filed whenever a litigant seeks to secure appellate review by the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel. An appeal from an interlocutory order which will be heard only if leave is granted under 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1334(b) or 1482(b) is taken by filing a notice of appeal accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal which complies with the requirements set forth in Rule 8003. Rule 8003 also governs other aspects of interlocutory appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is an adaptation of Rule 42 F.R.App.P.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> deals with the situation in which an appellant perfects an appeal to the district court or a bankruptcy appellate panel and also a direct appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1293(b) to the court of appeals. This subdivision provides that once the appeal to the court of appeals is taken, a notice of appeal to the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel shall be dismissed and, if the first appeal is to the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel, the first appeal shall be dismissed. Paragraph (3) gives an appellant or cross appellant an opportunity to file an appeal to the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel if the court of appeals dismisses the direct appeal because the judgment, order, or decree appealed from is not final. Since the court of appeals has determined the judgment, order, or decree is not final, the new appeal is an appeal for which leave is necessary.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> are amended to conform to the 1984 amendments.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:74 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is abrogated because there is no direct appeal to the court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. &sect;158, as enacted by the 1984 amendments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is new. Section 158(b)(1) of title 28 authorizes the circuit councils to establish bankruptcy appellate panels. Appeals may not be heard by these panels unless the district court authorizes the referral and all parties to the appeal consent. This rule requires that the parties consent to such an appeal; however, the method of consenting to an appeal may be the subject of a rule promulgated by a circuit council under Rule 8018.</p>
