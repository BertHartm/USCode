<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule implements the Code provisions concerning the filing of plans in chapters 9 and 11.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Chapter 9 Cases</em>. Section 941 provides that the debtor may file a plan with the petition or thereafter but within a time fixed by the court. A rule, therefore, is unnecessary to specify the time for filing chapter 9 plans.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Chapter 11 Nonrailroad Cases</em>. Section 1121 contains detailed provisions with respect to who may file a chapter 11 plan and, in part, the time period. Section 1121(a) permits a debtor to file a plan with the petition or at any time during the case. Section 1121(b) and (c) grants exclusive periods of 120 days and 180 days for the debtor to file and obtain acceptance of a plan. Failure to take advantage of these periods or the appointment of a trustee would permit other parties in interest to file a plan. These statutory provisions are not repeated in the rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Chapter 11 Railroad Cases</em>. Pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 11, &sect;1121 of the Code is applicable in railroad cases; see &sect;&sect;1161, 103(g). A trustee, however, is to be appointed in every case; thus, pursuant to &sect;1121(c), any party in interest may file a plan. See discussion of subdivision (a) of this rule, <em>infra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Section 1121(c), while permitting parties in interest a limited right to file plans, does not provide any time limitation. This subdivision sets as the deadline, the conclusion of the hearing on the disclosure statement. The court may, however, grant additional time. It is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;301(c)(2) which used, as the cut-off time, the conclusion of the hearing on approval of a plan. As indicated, <em>supra</em>, &sect;1121(a) permits a debtor to file a plan at any time during the chapter 11 case. Under &sect;1121(c), parties other than a debtor may file a plan only after a trustee is appointed or the debtor's exclusive time expires.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> requires plans to be properly identified.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This provision is new. In chapter 9 and 11 cases (including railroad reorganization cases) postpetition solicitation of votes on a plan requires transmittal of a disclosure statement, the contents of which have been approved by the court. See &sect;1125 of the Code. A prepetition solicitation must either have been in conformity with applicable nonbankruptcy law or, if <!-- PDFPage:48 -->none, the disclosure must have been of adequate information as set forth in &sect;1125 of the Code. See &sect;1126(b). Subdivision (c) of this rule provides the time for filing the disclosure statement or evidence of compliance with &sect;1126(b) which ordinarily will be with the plan but the court may allow a later time or the court may, pursuant to the last sentence, fix a time certain. Rule 3017 deals with the hearing on the disclosure statement. The disclosure statement, pursuant to &sect;1125 is to contain adequate information. &ldquo;Adequate information&rdquo; is defined in &sect;1125(a) as information that would permit a reasonable creditor or equity security holder to make an informed judgment on the plan.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to enlarge the time for filing competing plans. A party in interest may not file a plan without leave of court only if an order approving a disclosure statement relating to another plan has been entered and a decision on confirmation of the plan has not been entered. This subdivision does not fix a deadline beyond which a debtor may not file a plan.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1121(c) gives a party in interest the right to file a chapter 11 plan after expiration of the period when only the debtor may file a plan. Under &sect;1121(d), the exclusive period in which only the debtor may file a plan may be extended, but only if a party in interest so requests and the court, after notice and a hearing, finds cause for an extension. Subdivision (a) is abrogated because it could have the effect of extending the debtor's exclusive period for filing a plan without satisfying the requirements of &sect;1121(d). The abrogation of subdivision (a) does not affect the court's discretion with respect to the scheduling of hearings on the approval of disclosure statements when more than one plan has been filed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (c), redesignated as subdivision (b), is stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 3016</em>. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change.</p>
