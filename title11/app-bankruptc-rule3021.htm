<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">After confirmation of a plan, distribution shall be made to creditors whose claims have been allowed, to interest holders whose interests have not been disallowed, and to indenture trustees who have filed claims pursuant to Rule 3003(c)(5) that have been allowed. For the purpose of this rule, creditors include holders of bonds, debentures, notes, and other debt securities, and interest holders include the holders of stock and other equity securities, of record at the time of commencement of distribution unless a different time is fixed by the plan or the order confirming the plan.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;405(a). Subdivision (b) of that rule is covered by &sect;1143 of the Code.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to provide flexibility in fixing the record date for the purpose of making distributions to holders of securities of record. In a large case, it may be impractical for the debtor to determine the holders of record with respect to publicly held securities and also to make distributions to those holders at the same time. Under this amendment, the plan or the order confirming the plan may fix a record date for distributions that is earlier than the date on which distributions commence.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule also is amended to treat holders of bonds, debentures, notes, and other debt securities the same as any other creditors by providing that they shall receive a distribution only if their claims have been allowed. Finally, the amendments clarify that distributions are to be made to all interest holders&mdash;not only those that are within the definition of &ldquo;equity security holders&rdquo; under &sect;101 of the Code&mdash;whose interests have not been disallowed.</p>
