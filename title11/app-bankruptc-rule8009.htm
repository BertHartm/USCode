<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Briefs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel by local rule or by order excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The appellant shall serve and file a brief within 15 days after entry of the appeal on the docket pursuant to Rule 8007.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The appellee shall serve and file a brief within 15 days after service of the brief of appellant. If the appellee has filed a cross appeal, the brief of the appellee shall contain the issues and argument pertinent to the cross appeal, denominated as such, and the response to the brief of the appellant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 10 days after service of the brief of the appellee, and if the appellee has cross-appealed, the appellee may file and serve a reply brief to the response of the appellant to the issues presented in the cross appeal within 10 days after service of the reply brief of the appellant. No further briefs may be filed except with leave of the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appendix to Brief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the appeal is to a bankruptcy appellate panel, the appellant shall serve and file with the appellant's brief excerpts of the record as an appendix, which shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The complaint and answer or other equivalent pleadings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any pretrial order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The judgment, order, or decree from which the appeal is taken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any other orders relevant to the appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The opinion, findings of fact, or conclusions of law filed or delivered orally by the court and citations of the opinion if published;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Any motion and response on which the court rendered decision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The notice of appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The relevant entries in the bankruptcy docket; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The transcript or portion thereof, if so required by a rule of the bankruptcy appellate panel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An appellee may also serve and file an appendix which contains material required to be included by the appellant but omitted by appellant.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of this rule is adapted from Rules 28(a) and 31(a) F.R.App.P. The introductory clause of the rule recognizes the desirability of allowing local and individual variation in the filing of briefs. The numbered paragraphs prescribe shorter periods than the corresponding periods allowed by Rule 31(a) F.R.App.P.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>, which is similar to an interim rule for bankruptcy appellate panels promulgated by the Ninth Circuit, applies only when an appeal is to an appellate panel. The appellant must prepare an appendix to the brief which contains the documents relevant to the appeal. With the appendix available to each member of the appellate panel, it is unlikely that multiple copies of the record will be necessary. The last sentence of the subdivision enables the appellee to correct an omission of the appellant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 30 F.R.App.P., which governs the preparation of the appendix in appeals taken to the courts of appeals, specifies fewer documents which must be included in the appendix but permits the parties to include any other material.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 8007(c) permits a rule of the bankruptcy appellate panel to provide that the record is to be retained rather than transmitted. The new paragraph (9) of subdivision (b) of this rule complements Rule 8007(c) by authorizing a rule of the panel to require inclusion of the transcript or a portion thereof in the appendix.</p>
