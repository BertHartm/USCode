<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5003. Records Kept by the Clerk</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Bankruptcy Dockets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall keep a docket in each case under the Code and shall enter thereon each judgment, order, and activity in that case as prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The entry of a judgment or order in a docket shall show the date the entry is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Claims Register</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall keep in a claims register a list of claims filed in a case when it appears that there will be a distribution to unsecured creditors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judgments and Orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall keep, in the form and manner as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may prescribe, a correct copy of every final judgment or order affecting title to or lien on real property or for the recovery of money or property, and any other order which the court may direct to be kept. On request of the prevailing party, a correct copy of every judgment or order affecting title to or lien upon real or personal property or for the recovery of money or property shall be kept and indexed with the civil judgments of the district court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Index of Cases; Certificate of Search</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall keep indices of all cases and adversary proceedings as prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. On request, the clerk shall make a search of any index and papers in the clerk's custody and certify whether a case or proceeding has been filed in or transferred to the court or if a discharge has been entered in its records.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Other Books and Records of the Clerk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall also keep such other books and records as may be required by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule consolidates former Bankruptcy Rules 504 and 507. The record-keeping duties of the referee under former Bankruptcy Rule 504 are transferred to the clerk. Subdivisions (a), (c), (d) and (e) are similar to subdivisions (a)&ndash;(d) of Rule 79 F.R.Civ.P.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> requires that filed claims be listed on a claims register only when there may be a distribution to unsecured creditors. Compilation of the list for no asset or nominal asset cases would serve no purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 2013 requires the clerk to maintain a public record of fees paid from the estate and an annual summary thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Bankruptcy Rules 507(d) and 508, which made materials in the clerk's office and files available to the public, are not necessary because &sect;107 of the Code guarantees public access to files and dockets of cases under the Code.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> has been made more specific.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to require that on the request of the prevailing party the clerk of the district court shall keep and index bankruptcy judgments and orders affecting title to or lien upon real or personal property or for the recovery of money or property with the civil judgments of the district court. This requirement is derived from former Rule 9021(b). The Director of the Administrative Office will provide guidance to the bankruptcy and district court clerks regarding appropriate paperwork and retention procedures.</p>
