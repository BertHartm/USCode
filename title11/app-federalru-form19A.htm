<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995</h4>
<p class="note-body">This form is new. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 requires a &ldquo;bankruptcy petition preparer,&rdquo; as defined in 11 U.S.C. &sect;110, to sign any &ldquo;document for filing&rdquo; that the bankruptcy petition preparer prepares for compensation on behalf of a debtor, to disclose on the document certain information, and to provide the debtor with a copy of the document. This form or adaptations of this form have been incorporated into the official forms of the voluntary petition, the schedules, the statement of financial affairs, and other official forms that typically would be prepared for a debtor by a bankruptcy petition preparer. This form is to be used in connection with any other document that a bankruptcy petition preparer prepares for filing by a debtor in a bankruptcy case.</p>
