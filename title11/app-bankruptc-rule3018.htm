<h3 class="section-head">Rule 3018. Acceptance or Rejection of Plan in a Chapter 9 Municipality or a Chapter 11 Reorganization Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entities Entitled To Accept or Reject Plan; Time for Acceptance or Rejection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan may be accepted or rejected in accordance with &sect;1126 of the Code within the time fixed by the court pursuant to Rule 3017. Subject to subdivision (b) of this rule, an equity security holder or creditor whose claim is based on a security of record shall not be entitled to accept or reject a plan unless the equity security holder or creditor is the holder of record of the security on the date the order approving the disclosure statement is entered. For cause shown, the court after notice and hearing may permit a creditor or equity security holder to change or withdraw an acceptance or rejection. Notwithstanding objection to a claim or interest, the court after notice and hearing may temporarily allow the claim or interest in an amount which the court deems proper for the purpose of accepting or rejecting a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acceptances or Rejections Obtained Before Petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An equity security holder or creditor whose claim is based on a security of record who accepted or rejected the plan before the commencement of the case shall not be deemed to have accepted or rejected the plan pursuant to &sect;1126(b) of the Code unless the equity security holder or creditor was the holder of record of the security on the date specified in the solicitation of such acceptance or rejection for the purposes of such solicitation. A holder of a claim or interest who has accepted or rejected a plan before the commencement of the case under the Code shall not be deemed to have accepted or rejected the plan if the court finds after notice and hearing that the plan was not transmitted to substantially all creditors and equity security holders of the same class, that an unreasonably short time was prescribed for such creditors and equity security holders to accept or reject the plan, or that the solicitation was not in compliance with &sect;1126(b) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Form of Acceptance or Rejection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An acceptance or rejection shall be in writing, identify the plan or plans accepted or rejected, be signed by the creditor or equity security holder or an authorized agent, and conform to the appropriate Official Form. If more than one plan is transmitted pursuant to Rule 3017, an acceptance or rejection may be filed by each creditor or equity security holder for any number of plans transmitted and if acceptances are filed for more than one plan, the creditor or equity security holder may indicate a preference or preferences among the plans so accepted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Acceptance or Rejection by Partially Secured Creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor whose claim has been allowed in part as a secured claim and in part as an unsecured claim shall be entitled to accept or reject a plan in both capacities.</p>

<p class="source-credit">(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Aug. 1, 1993.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule applies in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases under the Code. The references in the rule to equity security holders will not, however, be relevant in chapter 9 or 13 cases. The rule will be of little utility in a chapter 13 case because only secured creditors may be requested to vote on a plan; unsecured creditors are not entitled to vote; see &sect;1325(a)(4), (5) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is derived from former Rule 10&ndash;305(a). It substitutes, in a reorganization case, entry of the order approving the disclosure statement for the order approving a plan in conformity with the differences between Chapter X and chapter 11. In keeping with the underlying theory it continues to recognize that the lapse of time between the filing of the petition and entry of such order will normally be significant and, during that interim, bonds and equity interests can change ownership.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> recognizes the former Chapter XI practice permitting a plan and acceptances to be filed with the petition, as does &sect;1126(b) of the Code. However, because a plan under chapter 11 may affect shareholder interests, there should be reference to a record date of ownership. In this instance the appropriate record date is that used in the prepetition solicitation materials because it is those acceptances or rejections which are being submitted to the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">While &sect;1126(c), (d), and (e) prohibits use of an acceptance or rejection not procured in good faith, the added provision in subdivision (b) of the rule is somewhat more detailed. It would prohibit use of prepetition acceptances or rejections when some but not all impaired creditors or equity security holders are solicited or when they are not given a reasonable opportunity to submit their acceptances or rejections. This provision together with &sect;1126(e) gives the court the power to nullify abusive solicitation procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. It is possible that multiple plans may be before the court for confirmation. Pursuant to &sect;1129(c) of the Code, the court may confirm only one plan but is required to consider the preferences expressed by those accepting the plans in determining which one to confirm.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivisions (d) and (e) of former Rule 10&ndash;305 are not continued since comparable provisions are contained in the statute; see &sect;1126(c), (d), (e).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:48 --><p class="note-body">It should be noted that while the singular &ldquo;plan&rdquo; is used throughout, by construction the plural is included; see &sect;102(7).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> are amended to delete provisions that duplicate &sect;1126 of the Code. An entity who is not a record holder of a security, but who claims that it is entitled to be treated as a record holder, may file a statement pursuant to Rule 3003(d).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended further to allow the court to permit a creditor or equity security holder to change or withdraw an acceptance or rejection for cause shown whether or not the time fixed for voting has expired.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is also amended to give effect to a prepetition acceptance or rejection if solicitation requirements were satisfied with respect to substantially all members of the same class, instead of requiring proper solicitation with respect to substantially all members of all classes.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended to delete the Official Form number in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The title of this rule is amended to indicate that it applies only in a chapter 9 or a chapter 11 case. The amendment of the word &ldquo;Plans&rdquo; to &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; is stylistic.</p>
