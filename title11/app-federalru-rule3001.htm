<h3 class="section-head">Rule 3001. Proof of Claim</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Form and Content</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proof of claim is a written statement setting forth a creditor's claim. A proof of claim shall conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Who May Execute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proof of claim shall be executed by the creditor or the creditor's authorized agent except as provided in Rules 3004 and 3005.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Claim Based on a Writing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a claim, or an interest in property of the debtor securing the claim, is based on a writing, the original or a duplicate shall be filed with the proof of claim. If the writing has been lost or destroyed, a statement of the circumstances of the loss or destruction shall be filed with the claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evidence of Perfection of Security Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a security interest in property of the debtor is claimed, the proof of claim shall be accompanied by evidence that the security interest has been perfected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transferred Claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Transfer of Claim Other Than for Security Before Proof Filed</em>. If a claim has been transferred other than for security before proof of the claim has been filed, the proof of claim may be filed only by the transferee or an indenture trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Transfer of Claim Other Than for Security After Proof Filed</em>. If a claim other than one based on a publicly traded note, bond, or debenture has been transferred other than for security after the proof of claim has been filed, evidence of the transfer shall be filed by the transferee. The clerk shall immediately notify the alleged transferor by mail of the filing of the evidence of transfer and that objection thereto, if any, must be filed within 20 days of the mailing of the notice or within any additional time allowed by the court. If the alleged transferor files a timely objection and the court finds, after notice and a hearing, that the claim has been transferred other than for security, it shall enter an order substituting the transferee for the transferor. If a timely objection is not filed by the alleged transferor, the transferee shall be substituted for the transferor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Transfer of Claim for Security Before Proof Filed</em>. If a claim other than one based on a publicly traded note, bond, or debenture has been transferred for security before proof of the claim has been filed, the transferor or transferee or both may file a proof of claim for the full amount. The proof shall be supported by a statement setting forth the terms of the transfer. If either the transferor or the transferee files a proof of claim, the clerk shall immediately notify the other by mail of the right to join in the filed claim. If both transferor and transferee file proofs of the same claim, the proofs shall be consolidated. If the transferor or transferee does not file an agreement regarding its relative rights respecting voting of the claim, payment of dividends thereon, or participation in the administration of the estate, on motion by a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall enter such orders respecting these matters as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Transfer of Claim for Security After Proof Filed</em>. If a claim other than one based on a publicly traded note, bond, or debenture has been transferred for security after the proof of claim has been filed, evidence of the terms of the transfer shall be filed by the transferee. The clerk shall immediately notify the alleged transferor by mail of the filing of the evidence of transfer and that objection thereto, if any, must be filed within 20 days of the mailing of the notice or within any additional time allowed by the court. If a timely objection is filed by the alleged transferor, the court, after notice and a hearing, shall determine whether the claim has been transferred for security. If the transferor or transferee does not file an agreement regarding its relative rights respecting voting of the claim, payment of dividends thereon, or participation in the administration of the estate, on motion by a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall enter such orders respecting these matters as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <em>Service of Objection or Motion; Notice of Hearing</em>. A copy of an objection filed pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) or a motion filed pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision together with a notice of a hearing shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the transferor or transferee, whichever is appropriate, at least 30 days prior to the hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Evidentiary Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with these rules shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_3001_1_target" name="Rule_3001_1">1</a></sup> To the extent not inconsistent with the United States Warehouse Act or applicable State law, a warehouse receipt, scale ticket, or similar document of the type routinely issued as evidence of title by a grain storage facility, as defined in section 557 of title 11, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of a claim of ownership of a quantity of grain.</p>

<p class="source-credit">(As amended Pub. L. 98&ndash;353, title III, &sect;354, July 10, 1984, 98 Stat. 361; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rules 301 and 302. The Federal Rules of Evidence, made applicable to cases under the Code by Rule 1101, do not prescribe the evidentiary effect to be accorded particular documents. Subdivision (f) of this rule supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence as they apply to cases under the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. This subdivision is similar to former Bankruptcy Rule 302(c) and continues the requirement <!-- PDFPage:40 -->for the filing of any written security agreement and provides that the filing of a duplicate of a writing underlying a claim authenticates the claim with the same effect as the filing of the original writing. <em>Cf</em>. Rules 1001(4) and 1003 of F.R. of Evid. Subdivision (d) together with the requirement in the first sentence of subdivision (c) for the filing of any written security agreement, is designed to facilitate the determination whether the claim is secured and properly perfected so as to be valid against the trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. &ldquo;Satisfactory evidence&rdquo; of perfection, which is to accompany the proof of claim, would include a duplicate of an instrument filed or recorded, a duplicate of a certificate of title when a security interest is perfected by notation on such a certificate, a statement that pledged property has been in possession of the secured party since a specified date, or a statement of the reasons why no action was necessary for perfection. The secured creditor may not be required to file a proof of claim under this rule if he is not seeking allowance of a claim for a deficiency. But see &sect;506(d) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The rule recognizes the differences between an unconditional transfer of a claim and a transfer for the purpose of security and prescribes a procedure for dealing with the rights of the transferor and transferee when the transfer is for security. The rule clarifies the procedure to be followed when a transfer precedes or follows the filing of the petition. The interests of sound administration are served by requiring the post-petition transferee to file with the proof of claim a statement of the transferor acknowledging the transfer and the consideration for the transfer. Such a disclosure will assist the court in dealing with evils that may arise out of post-bankruptcy traffic in claims against an estate. <em>Monroe v. Scofield</em>, 135 F.2d 725 (10th Cir. 1943); <em>In re Philadelphia & Western Ry</em>., 64 F. Supp. 738 (E.D. Pa. 1946); <em>cf. In re Latham Lithographic Corp</em>., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1939). Both paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subdivision, which deal with a transfer before the filing of a proof of claim, recognize that the transferee may be unable to obtain the required statement from the transferor, but in that event a sound reason for such inability must accompany the proof of claim filed by the transferee.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (3) and (4) clarify the status of a claim transferred for the purpose of security. An assignee for security has been recognized as a rightful claimant in bankruptcy. <em>Feder v. John Engelhorn & Sons</em>, 202 F.2d 411 (2d Cir. 1953). An assignor's right to file a claim notwithstanding the assignment was sustained in <em>In re R & L Engineering Co</em>., 182 F. Supp. 317 (S.D. Cal. 1960). Facilitation of the filing of proofs by both claimants as holders of interests in a single claim is consonant with equitable treatment of the parties and sound administration. See <em>In re Latham Lithographic Corp</em>., 107 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1939).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (2) and (4) of subdivision (e) deal with the transfer of a claim after proof has been filed. Evidence of the terms of the transfer required to be disclosed to the court will facilitate the court's determination of the appropriate order to be entered because of the transfer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (5) describes the procedure to be followed when an objection is made by the transferor to the transferee's filed evidence of transfer.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> was added by &sect;354 of the 1984 amendments.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is amended to limit the court's role to the adjudication of disputes regarding transfers of claims. If a claim has been transferred prior to the filing of a proof of claim, there is no need to state the consideration for the transfer or to submit other evidence of the transfer. If a claim has been transferred other than for security after a proof of claim has been filed, the transferee is substituted for the transferor in the absence of a timely objection by the alleged transferor. In that event, the clerk should note the transfer without the need for court approval. If a timely objection is filed, the court's role is to determine whether a transfer has been made that is enforceable under nonbankruptcy law. This rule is not intended either to encourage or discourage postpetition transfers of claims or to affect any remedies otherwise available under nonbankruptcy law to a transferor or transferee such as for misrepresentation in connection with the transfer of a claim. &ldquo;After notice and a hearing&rdquo; as used in subdivision (e) shall be construed in accordance with paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;with the clerk&rdquo; in subdivision (e)(2) and (e)(4) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
