<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Trustee or Debtor in Possession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trustee or debtor in possession shall (1) in a chapter 7 liquidation case and, if the court directs, in a chapter 11 reorganization case file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the property of the debtor within 30 days after qualifying as a trustee or debtor in possession, unless such an inventory has already been filed; (2) keep a record of receipts and the disposition of money and property received; (3) file the reports and summaries required by &sect;704(8) of the Code which shall include a statement, if payments are made to employees, of the amounts of deductions for all taxes required to be withheld or paid for and in behalf of employees and the place where these amounts are deposited; (4) as soon as possible after the commencement of the case, give notice of the case to every entity known to be holding money or property subject to withdrawal or order of the debtor, including every bank, savings or building and loan association, public utility company, and landlord with whom the debtor has a deposit, and to every insurance company which has issued a policy having a cash surrender value payable to the debtor, except that notice need not be given to any entity who has knowledge or has previously been notified of the case; (5) in a chapter 11 reorganization case, on or before the last day of the month after each calendar quarter until a plan is confirmed or the case is converted or dismissed, file and transmit to the United States trustee a statement of disbursements made during such calendar quarter and a statement of the amount of the fee required pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(a)(6) that has been paid for such calendar quarter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:35 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Chapter 12 Trustee and Debtor in Possession</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 12 family farmer's debt adjustment case, the debtor in possession shall perform the duties prescribed in clauses (2)&ndash;(4) of subdivision (a) of this rule and, if the court directs, shall file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the property of the debtor within the time fixed by the court. If the debtor is removed as debtor in possession, the trustee shall perform the duties of the debtor in possession prescribed in this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Chapter 13 Trustee and Debtor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Business Cases</em>. In a chapter 13 individual's debt adjustment case, when the debtor is engaged in business, the debtor shall perform the duties prescribed by clauses (2)&ndash;(4) of subdivision (a) of this rule and, if the court directs, shall file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the property of the debtor within the time fixed by the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule combines the provisions found in former Rules 218, 10&ndash;208, 11&ndash;30 and 13&ndash;208 of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. It specifies various duties which are in addition to those required by &sect;&sect;704, 1106, 1302 and 1304 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>subdivision (a)</em> the times permitted to be fixed by the court in clause (3) for the filing of reports and summaries may be fixed by local rule or order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This subdivision prescribes duties on either the debtor or trustee in chapter 13 cases, depending on whether or not the debtor is engaged in business (&sect;1304 of the Code). The duty of giving notice prescribed by subdivision (a)(4) is not included in a nonbusiness case because of its impracticability.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;208(c) which, in turn, was derived from &sect;190 of the Act. The equity security holders to whom the reports should be sent are those of record at the time of transmittal of such reports.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to add as a duty of the trustee or debtor in possession the filing of a notice of or a copy of the petition. The filing of such notice or a copy of the petition is essential to the protection of the estate from unauthorized post-petition conveyances of real property. Section 549(c) of the Code protects the title of a good faith purchaser for fair equivalent value unless the notice or copy of the petition is filed.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to provide the United States trustee with information needed to perform supervisory responsibilities in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3) and to exercise the right to raise, appear and be heard on issues pursuant to &sect;307 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(3)</em> is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to &sect;704(8) of the Code and the United States trustee system. It may not be necessary for the court to fix a time to file reports if the United States trustee requests that they be filed within a specified time and there is no dispute regarding such time.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)</em> is deleted because the filing of a notice of or copy of the petition to protect real property against unauthorized postpetition transfers in a particular case is within the discretion of the trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new subdivision (a)(5) was added to enable the United States trustee, parties in interest, and the court to determine the appropriate quarterly fee required by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(a)(6). The requirements of subdivision (a)(5) should be satisfied whenever possible by including this information in other reports filed by the trustee or debtor in possession. Nonpayment of the fee may result in dismissal or conversion of the case pursuant to &sect;1112(b) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule X&ndash;1007(b), which provides that the trustee or debtor in possession shall cooperate with the United States trustee by furnishing information that the United States trustee reasonably requires, is deleted as unnecessary. The deletion of Rule X&ndash;1007(b) should not be construed as a limitation of the powers of the United States trustee or of the duty of the trustee or debtor in possession to cooperate with the United States trustee in the performance of the statutory responsibilities of that office.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6)</em> is abrogated as unnecessary. See &sect;1106(a)(7) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(7)</em> is abrogated. The closing of a chapter 11 case is governed by Rule 3022.</p>
<p class="note-body">New <em>subdivision (b)</em>, which prescribes the duties of the debtor in possession and trustee in a chapter 12 case, does not prohibit additional reporting requirements pursuant to local rule or court order.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)</em> provides that the trustee in a chapter 7 case and, if the court directs, the trustee or debtor in possession in a chapter 11 case, is required to file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the debtor's property within 30 days after qualifying as trustee or debtor in possession, unless such an inventory has already been filed. Subdivisions (b) and (c) are amended to clarify that a debtor in possession and trustee in a chapter 12 case, and a debtor in a chapter 13 case where the debtor is engaged in business, are not required to file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the property of the debtor unless the court so directs. If the court so directs, the court also fixes the time limit for filing and transmitting the inventory.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 2015</em>. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change in the first sentence of the committee note.</p>
