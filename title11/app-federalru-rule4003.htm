<h3 class="section-head">Rule 4003. Exemptions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Claim of Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A debtor shall list the property claimed as exempt under &sect;522 of the Code on the schedule of assets required to be filed by Rule 1007. If the debtor fails to claim exemptions or file the schedule within the time specified in Rule 1007, a dependent of the debtor may file the list within 30 days thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objecting to a Claim of Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as exempt only within 30 days after the meeting of creditors held under &sect;341(a) is concluded or within 30 days after any amendment to the list or supplemental schedules is filed, whichever is later. The court may, for cause, extend the time for filing objections if, before the time to object expires, a party in interest files a request for an extension. Copies of the objections shall be delivered or mailed to the trustee, the person filing the list, and the attorney for that person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Burden of Proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any hearing under this rule, the objecting party has the burden of proving that the exemptions are not properly claimed. After hearing on notice, the court shall determine the issues presented by the objections.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Avoidance by Debtor of Transfers of Exempt Property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proceeding by the debtor to avoid a lien or other transfer of property exempt under &sect;522(f) of the Code shall be by motion in accordance with Rule 9014.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from &sect;522(1) of the Code and, in part, former Bankruptcy Rule 403. The Code changes the thrust of that rule by making it the burden of the debtor to list his exemptions and the burden of parties in interest to raise objections in the absence of which &ldquo;the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt;&rdquo; &sect;522(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. While &sect;522(1) refers to a list of property claimed as exempt, the rule incorporates such a list as part of Official Form No. 6, the schedule of the debtor's assets, rather than requiring a separate list and filing. Rule 1007, to which subdivision (a) refers, requires that schedule to be filed within 15 days after the order for relief, unless the court extends the time.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 522(1) also provides that a dependent of the debtor may file the list if the debtor fails to do so. Subdivision (a) of the rule allows such filing from the expiration of the debtor's time until 30 days thereafter. Dependent is defined in &sect;522(a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> provides that a proceeding by the debtor, permitted by &sect;522(f) of the Code, is a contested matter rather than the more formal adversary proceeding. Proceedings within the scope of this subdivision are distinguished from proceedings brought by the trustee to avoid transfers. The latter are classified as adversary proceedings by Rule 7001.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to facilitate the filing of objections to exemptions claimed on a supplemental schedule filed under Rule 1007(h).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to permit the court to grant a timely request for an extension of time to file objections to the list of claimed exemptions, whether the court rules on the request before or after the expiration of the 30-day period. The purpose of this amendment is to avoid the harshness of the present rule which has been construed to deprive a bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to grant a timely request for an extension if it has failed to rule on the request within the 30-day period. See <em>In re Laurain</em>, 113 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 1997), <em>Matter of Stoulig</em>, 45 F.3d 957 (5th Cir. 1995), <em>In re Brayshaw</em>, 912 F.2d 1255 (10th Cir. 1990). The amendments clarify that the extension may be granted only for cause. The amendments also conform the rule to &sect;522(<em>l</em>) of the Code by recognizing that any party in interest may file an objection or request for an extension of time under this rule. Other amendments are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4003(b)</em>. The words &ldquo;trustee or creditor&rdquo; were replaced by &ldquo;party in interest&rdquo; to conform to &sect;522(<em>l</em>) of the Bankruptcy Code which permits any party in interest to object to claimed exemptions. Style revisions also were made to the published draft.</p>
