<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of Rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This rule applies in chapter 9 and 11 cases.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Schedule of Liabilities and List of Equity Security Holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Schedule of Liabilities.</em> The schedule of liabilities filed pursuant to &sect;521(l) of the Code shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claims of creditors, unless they are scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated. It shall not be necessary for a creditor or equity security holder to file a proof of claim or interest except as provided in subdivision (c)(2) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>List of Equity Security Holders.</em> The list of equity security holders filed pursuant to Rule 1007(a)(3) shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the equity security interests and it shall not be necessary for the holders of such interests to file a proof of interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Filing Proof of Claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Who May File.</em> Any creditor or indenture trustee may file a proof of claim within the time prescribed by subdivision (c)(3) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Who Must File.</em> Any creditor or equity security holder whose claim or interest is not scheduled or scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated shall file a proof of claim or interest within the time prescribed by subdivision (c)(3) of this rule; any creditor who fails to do so shall not be treated as a creditor with respect to such claim for the purposes of voting and distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Time for Filing.</em> The court shall fix and for cause shown may extend the time within which proofs of claim or interest may be filed. Notwithstanding the expiration of such time, a proof of claim may be filed to the extent and under the conditions stated in Rule 3002(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Effect of Filing Claim or Interest.</em> A proof of claim or interest executed and filed in accordance with this subdivision shall supersede any scheduling of that claim or interest pursuant to &sect;521(1) of the Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <em>Filing by Indenture Trustee.</em> An indenture trustee may file a claim on behalf of all known or unknown holders of securities issued pursuant to the trust instrument under which it is trustee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Proof of Right to Record Status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of Rules 3017, 3018 and 3021 and for receiving notices, an entity who is not the record holder of a security may file a statement setting forth facts which entitle that entity to be treated as the record holder. An objection to the statement may be filed by any party in interest.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a).</em> This rule applies only in chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. It is adapted from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;401 and provides an exception to the requirement for filing proofs of claim and interest as expressed in &sect;&sect;925 and 1111(a) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b).</em> This general statement implements &sect;&sect;925 and 1111(a) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c).</em> This subdivision permits, in paragraph (1), the filing of a proof of claim but does not make it mandatory. Paragraph (2) requires, as does the Code, filing when a claim is scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated as to amount. It is the creditor's responsibility to determine if the claim is accurately listed. Notice of the provision of this rule is provided for in Official Form No. 16, the order for the meeting of creditors. In an appropriate case the court may order creditors whose claims are scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated be notified of that fact but the procedure is left to the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;401(f).</p>
<p class="note-body">Except with respect to the need and time for filing claims, the other aspects concerning claims covered by Rules 3001 and 3002 are applicable in chapter 9 and 11 cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">Holders of equity security interests need not file proofs of interest. Voting and distribution participation is dependent on ownership as disclosed by the appropriate records of a transfer agent or the corporate or other business records at the time prescribed in Rules 3017 and 3021.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) is amended to permit the late filing of claims by infants or incompetent persons under the same circumstances that permit late filings in cases under chapter 7, 12, or 13. The amendment also provides sufficient time in which to file a claim that arises from a postpetition judgment against the claimant for the recovery of money or property or the avoidance of a lien. It also provides for purposes of clarification that upon rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, the court shall set a time for filing a claim arising therefrom despite prior expiration of the time set for filing proofs of claim.</p>
<p class="note-body">The caption of paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) is amended to indicate that it applies to a proof of claim.</p>
