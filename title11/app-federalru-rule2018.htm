In a chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 case, the Attorney General of a State may appear and be heard on behalf of consumer creditors if the court determines the appearance is in the public interest, but the Attorney General may not appeal from any judgment, order, or decree in the case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Rules 8&ndash;210, 9&ndash;15 and 10&ndash;210 and it implements &sect;&sect;1109 and 1164 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to &sect;1109 of the Code, parties in interest have a right to be heard and the Securities and Exchange Commission may raise and be heard on any issue but it may not take an appeal. That section is applicable in chapter 9 cases (&sect;901 of the Code) and in chapter 11 cases, including cases under subchapter IV thereof for the reorganization of a railroad.</p>
<p class="note-body">In a railroad reorganization case under subchapter IV of chapter 11, &sect;1164 also gives the right to be heard to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Department of Transportation and any state or local regulatory commission with jurisdiction over the debtor, but these entities may not appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule does not apply in adversary proceedings. For intervention in adversary proceedings, see Rule 7024. The rules do not provide any right of compensation to or reimbursement of expenses for intervenors or others covered by this rule. Section 503(b)(3)(D) and (4) is not applicable to the entities covered by this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8&ndash;210 and former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;210. It permits intervention of an entity (see &sect;101(14), (21) of the Code) not otherwise entitled to do so under the Code or this rule. Such a party seeking to intervene must show cause therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> specifically grants the appropriate state's Attorney General the right to appear and be heard on behalf of consumer creditors when it is in the public interest. See House Rep. No. 95&ndash;595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 189. While &ldquo;consumer creditor&rdquo; is not defined in the Code or elsewhere, it would include the type of individual entitled to priority under &sect;507(a)(5) of the Code, that is, an individual who has deposited money for the purchase, lease or rental of property or the purchase of services for the personal, family, or household use of the individual. It would also include individuals who purchased or leased property for such purposes in connection with which there may exist claims for breach of warranty.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision does not grant the Attorney General the status of party in interest. In other contexts, the Attorney General will, of course, be a party in interest as for example, in representing a state in connection with a tax claim.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> recognizes the possible interests of the Secretary of the Treasury or of the state of the debtor's locale when a municipality is the debtor. It is derived from former Chapter IX Rule 9&ndash;15 and &sect;85(d) of the Act.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;210 which, in turn, was derived from &sect;206 of the Act. Section 206 has no counterpart in the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8&ndash;210(d). It gives the court flexibility in directing the type of future notices to be given intervenors.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to make it clear that the prohibition against appeals by labor unions is limited only to their participation in connection with the hearings on the plan as provided in subdivision (d). If a labor union would otherwise have the right to file an appeal or to be a party to an appeal, this rule does not preclude the labor union from exercising that right.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b) and (d)</em> are amended to include chapter 12.</p>
