<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deposit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 11 case, prior to entry of the order confirming the plan, the court may order the deposit with the trustee or debtor in possession of the consideration required by the plan to be distributed on confirmation. Any money deposited shall be kept in a special account established for the exclusive purpose of making the distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objection to and Hearing on Confirmation in a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 Case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Objection.</em> An objection to confirmation of the plan shall be filed and served on the debtor, the trustee, the proponent of the plan, any committee appointed under the Code, and any other entity designated by the court, within a time fixed by the court. Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, a copy of every objection to confirmation shall be transmitted by the objecting party to the United States trustee within the time fixed for filing objections. An objection to confirmation is governed by Rule 9014.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Hearing.</em> The court shall rule on confirmation of the plan after notice and hearing as provided in Rule 2002. If no objection is timely filed, the court may determine that the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law without receiving evidence on such issues.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order of Confirmation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The order of confirmation shall conform to the appropriate Official Form and notice of entry thereof shall be mailed promptly as provided in Rule 2002(f) to the debtor, the trustee, creditors, equity security holders, and other parties in interest. Except in a chapter 9 municipality case, notice of entry of the order of confirmation shall be transmitted to the United States trustee as provided in Rule 2002(k).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Retained Power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the entry of the order of confirmation, the court may issue any other order necessary to administer the estate.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Rules 10&ndash;307, 11&ndash;38, and 13&ndash;213. It applies to cases filed under chapters 9, 11 and 13. Certain subdivisions of the earlier rules have not been included, such as, a subdivision revesting title in the debtor because &sect;541 of the Code does not transfer title out of the debtor as did &sect;70a of the Bankruptcy Act; see also &sect;&sect;1141(b), 1327(b). Subdivision (b) of former Rule 13&ndash;213 is not included because its provisions are contained in the statute; see &sect;&sect;1322, 1325(b), 105.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> gives discretion to the court to require in chapter 11 cases the deposit of any consideration to be distributed on confirmation. If money is to be distributed, it is to be deposited in a special account to assure that it will not be used for any other purpose. The Code is silent in chapter 11 with respect to the need to make a deposit or the person with whom any deposit is to be made. Consequently, there is no statutory authority for any person to act in a capacity similar to the disbursing agent under former Chapter XI practice. This rule provides that only the debtor in possession or trustee should be appointed as the recipient of the deposit. Any consideration other than money, <em>e.g.,</em> notes or stock may be given directly to the debtor in possession or trustee and need not be left in any kind of special account. In chapter 9 cases, &sect;944(b) provides for deposit with a disbursing agent appointed by the court of any consideration to be distributed under the plan.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> clarifies the authority of the court to conclude matters pending before it prior to confirmation and to continue to administer the estate as necessary, <em>e.g.,</em> resolving objections to claims.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee monitors chapter 11, chapter 12, and chapter 13 plans and has standing to be heard regarding confirmation of a plan. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3). The amendments to subdivisions (b)(1) and (c) of this rule facilitate that role of the United States trustee. Subdivision (b)(1) is also amended to require service on the proponent of the plan of objections to confirmation. The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; in subdivision (b)(1) are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">In a chapter 12 case, the court is required to conduct and conclude the hearing on confirmation of the plan within the time prescribed in &sect;1224 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is also amended to require that the confirmation order be mailed to the trustee. Reference to the Official Form number is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:48 --><h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to limit its application to chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. The procedures relating to confirmation of plans in chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases are provided in Rule 3015. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>
