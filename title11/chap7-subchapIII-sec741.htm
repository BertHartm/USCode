<h4 class="note-head">senate report no. 95&ndash;989</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 741 sets forth definitions for subchapter III of chapter 7.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) defines &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to mean the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) defines &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to include anybody that interacts with the debtor in a capacity that concerns securities transactions. The term embraces cash or margin customers of a broker or dealer in the broadest sense.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) defines &ldquo;customer name security&rdquo; in a restrictive fashion to include only non-transferable securities that are registered, or in the process of being registered in a customer's own name. The securities must not be endorsed by the customer and the stockbroker must not be able to legally transfer the securities by delivery, by a power of attorney, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (4) defines &ldquo;customer property&rdquo; to include all property of the debtor that has been segregated for customers or property that should have been segregated but was unlawfully converted. Clause (i) refers to customer property not properly segregated by the debtor or customer property converted and then recovered so as to become property of the estate. Unlawfully converted property that has been transferred to a third party is excluded until it is recovered as property of the estate by virtue of the avoiding powers. The concept excludes customer name securities that have been delivered to or reclaimed by a customer and any property properly belonging to the stockholder, such as money deposited by a customer to pay for securities that the stockholder has distributed to such customer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (5) [enacted as (6)] defines &ldquo;net equity&rdquo; to establish the extent to which a customer will be entitled to share in the single and separate fund. Accounts of a customer are aggregated and offset only to the extent the accounts are held by the customer in the same capacity. Thus, a personal account is separate from an account held as trustee. In a community property state an account held for the community is distinct from an account held as separate property.</p>
<p class="note-body">The net equity is computed by liquidating all securities positions in the accounts and crediting the account with any amount due to the customer. Regardless of the actual dates, if any, of liquidation, the customer is only entitled to the liquidation value at the time of the filing of the petition. To avoid double counting, the liquidation value of customer name securities belonging to a customer is excluded from net equity. Thus, clause (ii) includes claims against a customer resulting from the liquidation of a security under clause (i). The value of a security on which trading has been suspended at the time of the filing of the petition will be estimated. Once the net liquidation value is computed, any amount that the customer owes to the stockbroker is subtracted including any amount that would be owing after the hypothetical liquidation, such as brokerage fees. Debts owed by the customer to the debtor, other than in a securities related transaction, will not reduce the net equity of the customer. Finally, net equity is increased by any payment by the customer to the debtor actually paid within 60 days after notice. The principal reason a customer would make such a payment is to reclaim customer name securities under &sect;751.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (6) defines &ldquo;1934 Act&rdquo; to mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.].</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (7) [enacted as (9)] defines &ldquo;SIPC&rdquo; to mean the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.</p>
