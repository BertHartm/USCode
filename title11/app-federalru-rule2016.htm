<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Application for Compensation or Reimbursement</cap-smallcap>. An entity seeking interim or final compensation for services, or reimbursement of necessary expenses, from the estate shall file an application setting forth a detailed statement of (1) the services rendered, time expended and expenses incurred, and (2) the amounts requested. An application for compensation shall include a statement as to what payments have theretofore been made or promised to the applicant for services rendered or to be rendered in any capacity whatsoever in connection with the case, the source of the compensation so paid or promised, whether any compensation previously received has been shared and whether an agreement or understanding exists between the applicant and any other entity for the sharing of compensation received or to be received for services rendered in or in connection with the case, and the particulars of any sharing of compensation or agreement or understanding therefor, except that details of any agreement by the applicant for the sharing of compensation as a member or regular associate of a firm of lawyers or accountants shall not be required. The requirements of this subdivision shall apply to an application for compensation for services rendered by an attorney or accountant even though the application is filed by a creditor or other entity. Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, the applicant shall transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Compensation Paid or Promised to Attorney for Debtor</cap-smallcap>. Every attorney for a debtor, whether or not the attorney applies for compensation, shall file and transmit to the United States trustee within 14 days after the order for relief, or at another time as the court may direct, the statement required by &sect;329 of the Code including whether the attorney has shared or agreed to share the compensation with any other entity. The statement shall include the particulars of any such sharing or agreement to share by the attorney, but the details of any agreement for the sharing of the compensation with a member or regular associate of the attorney's law firm shall not be required. A supplemental statement shall be filed and transmitted to the United States trustee within 14 days after any payment or agreement not previously disclosed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Compensation Paid or Promised to Bankruptcy Petition Preparer</cap-smallcap>. Before a petition is filed, every bankruptcy petition preparer for a debtor shall deliver to the debtor, the declaration under penalty of perjury required by &sect;110(h)(2). The declaration shall disclose any fee, and the source of any fee, received from or on behalf of the debtor within 12 months of the filing of the case and all unpaid fees charged to the debtor. The declaration shall also describe the services performed and documents prepared or caused to be prepared by the bankruptcy petition preparer. The declaration shall be filed with the petition. The petition preparer shall file a supplemental statement within 14 days after any payment or agreement not previously disclosed.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Rule 219. Many of the former rule's requirements are, however, set forth in the Code. Section 329 requires disclosure by an attorney of transactions with the debtor, &sect;330 sets forth the bases for allowing compensation, and &sect;504 prohibits sharing of compensation. This rule implements those various provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> includes within its provisions a committee, member thereof, agent, attorney or accountant for the committee when compensation or reimbursement of expenses is sought from the estate.</p>
<p class="note-body">Regular associate of a law firm is defined in Rule 9001(9) to include any attorney regularly employed by, associated with, or counsel to that law firm. Firm is defined in Rule 9001(6) to include a partnership or professional corporation.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to change &ldquo;person&rdquo; to &ldquo;entity&rdquo;. There are occasions in which a governmental unit may be entitled to file an application under this rule. The requirement that the application contain a &ldquo;detailed statement of services rendered, time expended and expenses incurred&rdquo; gives to the court authority to ensure that the application is both comprehensive and detailed. No amendments are made to delineate further the requirements of the application because the amount of detail to be furnished is a function of the nature of the services rendered and the complexity of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to require that the attorney for the debtor file the &sect;329 statement before the meeting of creditors. This will assist the parties in conducting the examination of the debtor. In addition, the amended rule requires the attorney to supplement the &sect;329 statement if an undisclosed payment is made to the attorney or a new or amended agreement is entered into by the debtor and the attorney.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to enable the United States trustee to perform the duty to monitor applications for compensation and reimbursement filed under &sect;330 of the Code. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(A).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to give the United States trustee the information needed to determine whether <!-- PDFPage:51 -->to request appropriate relief based on excessive fees under &sect;329(b) of the Code. See Rule 2017.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; are deleted in subdivisions (a) and (b) as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2003 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended by adding subdivision (c) to implement &sect;110(h)(1) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadline in the rule is amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;15-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;20-day periods become 21-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;25-day periods become 28-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect the 2005 amendment to &sect;110(h)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code which now requires that the declaration be filed with the petition. The statute previously required that the petition preparer file the declaration within 10 days after the filing of the petition. The amendment to the rule also corrects the cross reference to &sect;110(h)(1), which was redesignated as subparagraph (h)(2) of &sect;110 by the 2005 amendment to the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes are stylistic.</p>
