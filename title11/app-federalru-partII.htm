<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2001. Appointment of Interim Trustee Before Order for Relief in a Chapter 7 Liquidation Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time following the commencement of an involuntary liquidation case and before an order for relief, the court on written motion of a party in interest may order the appointment of an interim trustee under &sect;303(g) of the Code. The motion shall set forth the necessity for the appointment and may be granted only after hearing on notice to the debtor, the petitioning <!-- PDFPage:19 -->creditors, the United States trustee, and other parties in interest as the court may designate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Bond of Movant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An interim trustee may not be appointed under this rule unless the movant furnishes a bond in an amount approved by the court, conditioned to indemnify the debtor for costs, attorney's fee, expenses, and damages allowable under &sect;303(i) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order of Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The order directing the appointment of an interim trustee shall state the reason the appointment is necessary and shall specify the trustee's duties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Turnover and Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Following qualification of the trustee selected under &sect;702 of the Code, the interim trustee, unless otherwise ordered, shall (1) forthwith deliver to the trustee all the records and property of the estate in possession or subject to control of the interim trustee and, (2) within 30 days thereafter file a final report and account.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 201. See also former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;201. In conformity with title 11 of the United States Code, this rule substitutes &ldquo;interim trustee&rdquo; for &ldquo;receiver.&rdquo; Subdivision (a) and (e) of Rule 201 are not included because the provisions contained therein are found in detail in &sect;303(g) of the Code, or they are inconsistent with &sect;701 of the Code. Similarly, the provisions in Rule 201(d) relating to a debtor's counterbond are not included because of their presence in &sect;303(g).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> makes it clear that the court may not on its own motion order the appointment of an interim trustee before an order for relief is entered. Appointment may be ordered only on motion of a party in interest.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> requires those seeking the appointment of an interim trustee to furnish a bond. The bond may be the same one required of petitioning creditors under &sect;303(e) of the Code to indemnify the debtor for damages allowed by the court under &sect;303(i).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> requires that the order specify which duties enumerated in &sect;303(g) shall be performed by the interim trustee. Reference should be made to Rule 2015 for additional duties required of an interim trustee including keeping records and filing periodic reports with the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> requires turnover of records and property to the trustee selected under &sect;702 of the Code, after qualification. That trustee may be the interim trustee who becomes the trustee because of the failure of creditors to elect one under &sect;702(d) or the trustee elected by creditors under &sect;702(b), (c).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to conform to &sect;303(g) of the Code which provides that the United States trustee appoints the interim trustee. See Rule X&ndash;1003. This rule does not apply to the exercise by the court of the power to act sua sponte pursuant to &sect;105(a) of the Code.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Notice of Hearing on Compensation</em>. The notice of a hearing on an application for compensation or reimbursement of expenses required by subdivision (a)(6) of this rule shall identify the applicant and the amounts requested.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Other Notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subdivision (<em>l</em>) of this rule, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, all creditors, and indenture trustees notice by mail of: (1) the order for relief; (2) the dismissal or the conversion of the case to another chapter, or the suspension of proceedings under &sect;305; (3) the time allowed for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002; (4) the time fixed for filing a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge pursuant to &sect;727 of the Code as provided in Rule 4004; (5) the time fixed for filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt pursuant to &sect;523 of the Code as provided in Rule 4007; (6) the waiver, denial, or revocation of a discharge as provided in Rule 4006; (7) entry of an order confirming a chapter 9, 11, or 12 plan; and (8) a summary of the trustee's final report in a chapter 7 case if the net proceeds realized exceed $1,500.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Addresses of Notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All notices required to be mailed under this rule to a creditor, equity security holder, or indenture trustee shall be addressed as such entity or an authorized agent may direct in a filed request; otherwise, to the address shown in the list of creditors or the schedule whichever is filed later. If a different address is stated in a proof of claim duly filed, that address shall be used unless a notice of no dividend has been given.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Notices to Creditors Whose Claims are Filed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 7 case, after 90 days following the first date set for the meeting of creditors under &sect;341 of the Code, the court may direct that all notices required by subdivision (a) of this rule be mailed only to the debtor, the trustee, all indenture trustees, creditors that hold claims for which proofs of claim have been filed, and creditors, if any, that are still permitted to file claims by reason of an extension granted pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(1) or (c)(2). In a case where notice of insufficient assets to pay a dividend has been given to creditors pursuant to subdivision (e) of this rule, after 90 days following the mailing of a notice of the time for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(5), the court may direct that notices be mailed only to the entities specified in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Notices to Committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Copies of all notices required to be mailed pursuant to this rule shall be mailed to the committees elected under &sect;705 or appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code or to their authorized agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing subdivisions, the court may order that notices required by subdivision (a)(2), (3) and (6) of this rule be transmitted to the United States trustee and be mailed only to the committees elected under &sect;705 or appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code or to their authorized agents and to the creditors and equity security holders who serve on the trustee or debtor in possession and file a request that all notices be mailed to them. A committee appointed under &sect;1114 shall receive copies of all notices required by subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(5), (b), (f)(2), and (f)(7), and such other notices as the court may direct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Notices to the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Copies of notices required to be mailed to all creditors under this rule shall be mailed (1) in a chapter 11 reorganization case, to the Securities and Exchange Commission at any place the Commission designates, if the Commission has filed either a notice of appearance in the case or a written request to receive notices; (2) in a commodity broker case, to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at Washington, D.C.; (3) in a chapter 11 case to the District Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which the case is pending; (4) if the papers in the case disclose a debt to the United States other than for taxes, to the United States attorney for the district in which the case is pending and to the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States through which the debtor became indebted; or if the filed papers disclose a stock interest of the United States, to the Secretary of the Treasury at Washington, D.C.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Notices to United States Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case or unless the United States trustee requests otherwise, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall transmit to the United States trustee notice of the matters described in subdivisions (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(8), (b), (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(4), (f)(6), (f)(7), and (f)(8) of this rule and notice of hearings on all applications for compensation or reimbursement of expenses. Notices to the United States trustee shall be transmitted within the time prescribed in subdivision (a) or (b) of this rule. The United States trustee shall also receive notice of any other matter if such notice is requested by the United States trustee or ordered by the court. Nothing in these rules requires the clerk or any other person to transmit to the United States trustee any notice, schedule, report, application or other document in a case under the Securities Investor Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;78aaa et seq.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Notice by Publication</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The court may from time to time enter orders designating the matters in respect to which, the entity to whom, and the form and manner in which notices shall be sent except as otherwise provided by these rules.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Notice of Order for Relief in Consumer Case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a voluntary case commenced by an individual debtor whose debts are primarily consumer debts, the clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give the trustee and all creditors notice by mail of the order for relief within 20 days from the date thereof.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Some of the notices required by this rule may be given either by the clerk or as the court may otherwise direct. For example, the court may order the trustee or debtor in possession to transmit one or more of the notices required by this rule, such as, notice of a proposed sale of property. See &sect;363(b) of the Code. When publication of notices is required or desirable, reference should be made to Rule 9008.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notice of the order for relief is required to be given by &sect;342 of the Code and by subdivision (f)(1) of this rule. That notice may be combined with the notice of the meeting of creditors as indicated in Official Form No. 16, the notice and order of the meeting of creditors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> sets forth the requirement that 20 days notice be given of the significant events in a case under the Bankruptcy Code. The former Act and Rules provided a ten day notice in bankruptcy and Chapter XI cases, and a 20 day notice in a Chapter X case. This rule generally makes uniform the 20 day notice provision except that subdivision (b) contains a 25 day period for certain events in a chapter 9, 11, or 13 case. Generally, Rule 9006 permits reduction of time periods. Since notice by mail is complete on mailing, the requirement of subdivision (a) is satisfied if the notices are deposited in the mail at least 20 days before the event. See Rule 9006(e). The exceptions referred to in the introductory phrase include the modifications in the notice procedure permitted by subdivision (h) as to non-filing creditors, subdivision (i) as to cases where a committee is functioning, and subdivision (k) where compliance with subdivision (a) is impracticable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice of a proposed sale affords creditors an opportunity to object to the sale and raise a dispute for the court's attention. Section 363(b) of the Code permits the trustee or debtor in possession to sell property, other than in the ordinary course of business, only after notice and hearing. If no objection is raised after notice, &sect;102(1) provides that there need not be an actual hearing. Thus, absent objection, there would be no court involvement with respect to a trustee's sale. Once an objection is raised, only the court may pass on it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Prior to the Code the court could shorten the notice period for a proposed sale of property or dispense with notice. This subdivision (a), permits the 20 day period to be shortened in appropriate circumstances but the rule does not contain a provision allowing the court to dispense with notice. The rule is thus consistent with the Code, &sect;&sect;363(b) and 102(1)(A) of the Code. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;2075. It may be necessary, in certain circumstances, however, to use a method of notice other than mail. Subdivision (a)(2) vests the court with discretion, on cause shown, to order a different method. Reference should also be made to Rule 6004 which allows a different type of notice of proposed sales when the property is of little value.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notice of the hearing on an application for compensation or reimbursement of expenses totalling $100 or less need not be given. In chapter 13 cases relatively small amounts are sometimes allowed for post-confirmation services and it would not serve a useful purpose to require advance notice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is similar to subdivision (a) but lengthens the notice time to 25 days with respect to those events particularly significant in chapter 9, 11 and 13 cases. The additional time may be necessary to formulate objections to a disclosure statement or confirmation of a plan and preparation for the hearing on approval of the disclosure statement or confirmation. The disclosure statement and hearing thereon is only applicable in chapter 9 cases (&sect;901(a) of the Code), and chapter 11 cases (&sect;1125 of the Code).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> specifies certain matters that should be included in the notice of a proposed sale of property and notice of the hearing on an application for allowances. Rule 6004 fixes the time within which parties in interest may file objections to a proposed sale of property.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> relates exclusively to the notices given to equity security holders in chapter 11 cases. Under chapter 11, a plan may impair the interests of the debtor's shareholders or a plan may be a relatively simple restructuring of unsecured debt. In some cases, it is necessary that equity interest holders receive various notices and in other cases there is no purpose to be served. This subdivision indicates that the court is not mandated to order notices but rather that the matter should be treated with some flexibility. The court may decide whether notice is to be given and how it is to be given. Under &sect;341(b) of the Code, a meeting of equity security holders is not required in each case, only when it is ordered by the court. Thus subdivision (d)(2) requires notice only when the court orders a meeting.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the notices specified in this subdivision, there may be other events or matters arising in a case as to which equity security holders should receive notice. These are situations left to determination by the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>, authorizing a notice of the apparent insufficiency of assets for the payment of any dividend, is correlated with Rule 3002(c)(5), which provides for the issuance of an additional notice to creditors if the possibility of a payment later materializes.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em> provides for the transmission of other notices to which no time period applies. Clause (1) requires notice of the order for relief; this complements the mandate of &sect;342 of the Code requiring such notice as is appropriate of the order for relief. This notice may be combined with the notice of the meeting of creditors to avoid the necessity of more than one mailing. See Official Form No. 16, notice of meeting of creditors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> recognizes that an agent authorized to receive notices for a creditor may, without a court order, designate where notices to the creditor he represents should be addressed. Agent includes an officer of a corporation, an attorney at law, or an attorney in fact if the requisite authority has been given him. It should be noted that Official Forms Nos. 17 and 18 do not include an authorization of the holder of a power of attorney to receive notices for the creditor. Neither these forms nor this rule carries any implication that such an authorization may not be given in a power of attorney or that a request for notices to be addressed to both the creditor or his duly authorized agent may not be filed.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em>. After the time for filing claims has expired in a chapter 7 case, creditors who have not filed <!-- PDFPage:22 -->their claims in accordance with Rule 3002(c) are not entitled to share in the estate except as they may come within the special provisions of &sect;726 of the Code or Rule 3002(c)(6). The elimination of notice to creditors who have no recognized stake in the estate may permit economies in time and expense. Reduction of the list of creditors to receive notices under this subdivision is discretionary. This subdivision does not apply to the notice of the meeting of creditors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)</em> contains a list of matters of which notice may be given a creditors&rsquo; committee or to its authorized agent in lieu of notice to the creditors. Such notice may serve every practical purpose of a notice to all the creditors and save delay and expense. <em>In re Schulte-United, Inc</em>., 59 F.2d 553, 561 (8th Cir. 1932).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (j)</em>. The premise for the requirement that the district director of internal revenue receive copies of notices that all creditors receive in a chapter 11 case is that every debtor is potentially a tax debtor of the United States. Notice to the district director alerts him to the possibility that a tax debtor's estate is about to be liquidated or reorganized and that the debtor may be discharged. When other indebtedness to the United States is indicated, the United States attorney is notified as the person in the best position to protect the interests of the government. In addition, the provision requires notice by mail to the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States through whose action the debtor became indebted to the United States. This rule is not intended to preclude a local rule from requiring a state or local tax authority to receive some or all of the notices to creditors under these rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (k)</em> specifies two kinds of situations in which notice by publication may be appropriate: (1) when notice by mail is impracticable; and (2) when notice by mail alone is less than adequate. Notice by mail may be impracticable when, for example, the debtor has disappeared or his records have been destroyed and the names and addresses of his creditors are unavailable, or when the number of creditors with nominal claims is very large and the estate to be distributed may be insufficient to defray the costs of issuing the notices. Supplementing notice by mail is also indicated when the debtor's records are incomplete or inaccurate and it is reasonable to believe that publication may reach some of the creditors who would otherwise be missed. Rule 9008 applies when the court directs notice by publication under this rule. Neither clause (2) of subdivision (a) nor subdivision (k) of this rule is concerned with the publication of advertisement to the general public of a sale of property of the estate at public auction under Rule 6004(b). See 3 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> 522&ndash;23 (14th ed. 1971); 4B <em>id</em>. 1165&ndash;67 (1967); 2 <em>id</em>. &nbsp;363.03 (15th ed. 1981).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (m)</em>. Inclusion in notices to creditors of information as to other names used by the debtor as required by Rule 1005 will assist them in the preparation of their proofs of claim and in deciding whether to file a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge. Additional names may be listed by the debtor on his statement of affairs when he did not file the petition. The mailing of notices should not be postponed to await a delayed filing of the statement of financial affairs.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to provide that notice of a hearing on an application for compensation must be given only when the amount requested is in excess of $500.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. A new notice requirement is added as clause (3). When a proposed sale is of all or substantially all of the debtor's assets, it is appropriate that equity security holders be given notice of the proposed sale. The clauses of subdivision (d) are renumbered to accommodate this addition.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. Clause (7) is eliminated. Mailing of a copy of the discharge order is governed by Rule 4004(g).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> is amended to relieve the clerk of the duty to mail notices to the address shown in a proof of claim when a notice of no dividend has been given pursuant to Rule 2002. This amendment avoids the necessity of the clerk searching proofs of claim which are filed in no dividend cases to ascertain whether a different address is shown.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (n)</em> was enacted by &sect;321 of the 1984 amendments.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(3)</em> is amended to exclude compromise or settlement agreements concerning adequate protection or which modify or terminate the automatic stay, provide for use of cash collateral, or create a senior or equal lien on collateral to obtain credit. Notice requirements relating to approval of such agreements are governed by Rule 4001(d).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)</em> is amended to include a hearing on dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12 case. This subdivision does not apply when a hearing is not required. It is also amended to avoid the necessity of giving notice to all creditors of a hearing on the dismissal of a consumer debtor's case based on substantial abuse of chapter 7. Such hearings on dismissal under &sect;707(b) of the Code are governed by Rule 1017(e).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(9)</em> is added to provide for notice of the time fixed for filing objections and the hearing to consider confirmation of a plan in a chapter 12 case. Section 1224 of the Code requires &ldquo;expedited notice&rdquo; of the confirmation hearing in a chapter 12 case and requires that the hearing be concluded not later than 45 days after the filing of the plan unless the time is extended for cause. This amendment establishes 20 days as the notice period. The court may shorten this time on its own motion or on motion of a party in interest. The notice includes both the date of the hearing and the date for filing objections, and must be accompanied by a copy of the plan or a summary of the plan in accordance with Rule 3015(d).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to delete as unnecessary the references to subdivisions (h) and (i).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> does not require notice to equity security holders in a chapter 12 case. The procedural burden of requiring such notice is outweighed by the likelihood that all equity security holders of a family farmer will be informed of the progress of the case without formal notice. Subdivision (d) is amended to recognize that the United States trustee may convene a meeting of equity security holders pursuant to &sect;341(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)(2)</em> is amended and subdivision (f)(4) is deleted to require notice of any conversion of the case, whether the conversion is by court order or is effectuated by the debtor filing a notice of conversion pursuant to &sect;&sect;1208(a) or 1307(a). Subdivision (f)(8), renumbered (f)(7), is amended to include entry of an order confirming a chapter 12 plan. Subdivision (f)(9) is amended to increase the amount to $1,500.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (g) and (j)</em> are amended to delete the words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; and subdivision (i) is amended to delete the words &ldquo;with the clerk&rdquo; because these phrases are unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)</em> is amended to require that the United States trustee receive notices required by subdivision (a)(2), (3) and (7) of this rule notwithstanding a court order limiting such notice to committees and to creditors and equity security holders who request such notices. Subdivision (i) is amended further to include committees elected pursuant to &sect;705 of the Code and to provide that committees of retired employees appointed in chapter 11 cases receive certain notices.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (k)</em> is derived from Rule X&ndash;1008. The administrative functions of the United States trustee pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a) and standing to be heard on issues under &sect;307 and other sections of the Code require that the United States trustee be informed of developments and issues in every case except chapter 9 cases. The rule omits those notices described in subdivision (a)(1) because a meeting of creditors is convened only by the United States trustee, and those notices described in subdivision (a)(4) (date fixed for filing <!-- PDFPage:23 -->claims against a surplus), subdivision (a)(6) (time fixed to accept or reject proposed modification of a plan), subdivision (a)(8) (time fixed for filing proofs of claims in chapter 11 cases), subdivision (f)(3) (time fixed for filing claims in chapter 7, 12, and 13 cases), and subdivision (f)(5) (time fixed for filing complaint to determine dischargeability of debt) because these notices do not relate to matters that generally involve the United States trustee. Nonetheless, the omission of these notices does not prevent the United States trustee from receiving such notices upon request. The United States trustee also receives notice of hearings on applications for compensation or reimbursement without regard to the $500 limitation contained in subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. This rule is intended to be flexible in that it permits the United States trustee in a particular judicial district to request notices in certain categories, and to request not to receive notices in other categories, when the practice in that district makes that desirable.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (j)</em> is amended to avoid the necessity of sending an additional notice to the Washington, D.C. address of the Securities and Exchange Commission if the Commission prefers to have notices sent only to a local office. This change also clarifies that notices required to be mailed pursuant to this rule must be sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission only if it has filed a notice of appearance or has filed a written request. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (a)(4)</em> is abrogated to conform to the abrogation of Rule 3002(c)(6). The remaining paragraphs of subdivision (a) are renumbered, and references to these paragraphs contained in other subdivisions of this rule are amended accordingly.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (f)(8)</em> is amended so that a summary of the trustee's final account, which is prepared after distribution of property, does not have to be mailed to the debtor, all creditors, and indenture trustees in a chapter 7 case. Parties are sufficiently protected by receiving a summary of the trustee's final report that informs parties of the proposed distribution of property.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (h)</em> is amended (1) to provide that an order under this subdivision may not be issued if a notice of no dividend is given pursuant to Rule 2002(e) and the time for filing claims has not expired as provided in Rule 3002(c)(5); (2) to clarify that notices required to be mailed by subdivision (a) to parties other than creditors must be mailed to those entities despite an order issued pursuant to subdivision (h); (3) to provide that if the court, pursuant to Rule 3002(c)(1) or 3002(c)(2), has granted an extension of time to file a proof of claim, the creditor for whom the extension has been granted must continue to receive notices despite an order issued pursuant to subdivision (h); and (4) to delete references to subdivision (a)(4) and Rule 3002(c)(6), which have been abrogated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 2002</em>. No changes since publication, except for stylistic changes and the correction of a typographical error in the committee note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (a)(1)</em> is amended to include notice of a meeting of creditors convened under &sect;1104(b) of the Code for the purpose of electing a trustee in a chapter 11 case. The court for cause shown may order the 20-day period reduced pursuant to Rule 9006(c)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (n)</em> is amended to conform to the 1994 amendment to &sect;342 of the Code. As provided in &sect;342(c), the failure of a notice given by the debtor to a creditor to contain the information required by &sect;342(c) does not invalidate the legal effect of the notice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 2002</em>. No changes to the published draft.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (a)(4)</em> is amended to conform to the amendments to Rule 1017. If the United States trustee files a motion to dismiss a case for the debtor's failure to file the list of creditors, schedules, or the statement of financial affairs within the time specified in &sect;707(a)(3), the amendments to this rule and to Rule 1017 eliminate the requirement that all creditors receive notice of the hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (a)(4) is amended further to conform to Rule 1017(b), which requires that notice of the hearing on dismissal of a case for failure to pay the filing fee be served on only the debtor and the trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (f)(2)</em> is amended to provide for notice of the suspension of proceedings under &sect;305.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 2002</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Paragraph (a)(6)</em> is amended to increase the dollar amount from $500 to $1,000. The amount was last amended in 1987, when it was changed from $100 to $500. The amendment also clarifies that the notice is required only if a particular entity is requesting more than $1,000 as compensation or reimbursement of expenses. If several professionals are requesting compensation or reimbursement, and only one hearing will be held on all applications, notice under paragraph (a)(6) is required only with respect to the entities that have requested more than $1,000. If each applicant requests $1,000 or less, notice under paragraph (a)(6) is not required even though the aggregate amount of all applications to be considered at the hearing is more than $1,000.</p>
<p class="note-body">If a particular entity had filed prior applications or had received compensation or reimbursement of expenses at an earlier time in the case, the amounts previously requested or awarded are not considered when determining whether the present application exceeds $1,000 for the purpose of applying this rule.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2003. Meeting of Creditors or Equity Security Holders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Date and Place</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 7 liquidation or a chapter 11 reorganization case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of creditors to be held no fewer than 20 and no more than 40 days after the order for relief. In a chapter 12 family farmer debt adjustment case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of creditors to be held no fewer than 20 and no more than 35 days after the order for relief. In a chapter 13 individual's debt adjustment case, the United States trustee shall call a meeting of creditors to be held no fewer than 20 and no more than 50 days after the order for relief. If there is an appeal from or a motion to vacate the order for relief, or if there is a motion to dismiss the case, the United States trustee may set a later date for the meeting. The meeting may be held at a regular place for holding court or at any other place designated by the United States trustee within the district convenient for the parties in interest. If the United States trustee designates a place for the meeting which is not regularly staffed by the United States trustee or an assistant who may preside at the meeting, the meeting may be held not more than 60 days after the order for relief.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Order of Meeting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Meeting of Creditors</em>. The United States trustee shall preside at the meeting of creditors. The business of the meeting shall include the examination of the debtor under oath and, in a chapter 7 liquidation case, may include the election of a trustee or of a creditors&rsquo; committee. The presiding officer shall have the authority to administer oaths.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Meeting of Equity Security Holders</em>. If the United States trustee convenes a meeting of equity security holders pursuant to &sect;341(b) of the Code, the United States trustee shall fix a date for the meeting and shall preside.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Right To Vote</em>. In a chapter 7 liquidation case, a creditor is entitled to vote at a meeting if, at or before the meeting, the creditor has filed a proof of claim or a writing setting forth facts evidencing a right to vote pursuant to &sect;702(a) of the Code unless objection is made to the claim or the proof of claim is insufficient on its face. A creditor of a partnership may file a proof of claim or writing evidencing a right to vote for the trustee for the estate of the general partner notwithstanding that a trustee for the estate of the partnership has previously qualified. In the event of an objection to the amount or allowability of a claim for the purpose of voting, unless the court orders otherwise, the United States trustee shall tabulate the votes for each alternative presented by the dispute and, if resolution of such dispute is necessary to determine the result of the election, the tabulations for each alternative shall be reported to the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Record of Meeting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any examination under oath at the meeting of creditors held pursuant to &sect;341(a) of the Code shall be recorded verbatim by the United States trustee using electronic sound recording equipment or other means of recording, and such record shall be preserved by the United States trustee and available for public access until two years after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors. Upon request of any entity, the United States trustee shall certify and provide a copy or transcript of such recording at the entity's expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report of Election and Resolution of Disputes in a Chapter 7 Case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Report of Undisputed Election</em>. In a chapter 7 case, if the election of a trustee or a member of a creditors&rsquo; committee is not disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a report of the election, including the name and address of the person or entity elected and a statement that the election is undisputed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Disputed Election</em>. If the election is disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a report stating that the election is disputed, informing the court of the nature of the dispute, and listing the name and address of any candidate elected under any alternative presented by the dispute. No later than the date on which the report is filed, the United States trustee shall mail a copy of the report to any party in interest that has made a request to receive a copy of the report. Pending disposition by the court of a disputed election for trustee, the interim trustee shall continue in office. Unless a motion for the resolution of the dispute is filed no later than 10 days after the United States trustee files a report of a disputed election for trustee, the interim trustee shall serve as trustee in the case.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjournment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The meeting may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the meeting of the adjourned date and time without further written notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special Meetings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States trustee may call a special meeting of creditors on request of a party in interest or on the United States trustee's own initiative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Final Meeting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the United States trustee calls a final meeting of creditors in a case in which the net proceeds realized exceed $1,500, the clerk shall mail a summary of the trustee's final account to the creditors with a notice of the meeting, together with a statement of the amount of the claims allowed. The trustee shall attend the final meeting and shall, if requested, report on the administration of the estate.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 341(a) of the Code requires a meeting of creditors in a chapter 7, 11 or 13 case, and &sect;341(b) permits the court to order a meeting of equity security holders. A major change from prior law, however, prohibits the judge from attending or presiding over the meeting. Section 341(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule does not apply either in a case for the reorganization of a railroad or for the adjustment of debts of a municipality. Sections 1161 and 901 render &sect;&sect;341 and 343 inapplicable in these types of cases. Section 341 <!-- PDFPage:25 -->sets the requirement for a meeting of creditors and &sect;343 provides for the examination of the debtor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The meeting is to be held between 20 and 40 days after the date of the order for relief. In a voluntary case, the date of the order for relief is the date of the filing of the petition (&sect;301 of the Code); in an involuntary case, it is the date of an actual order (&sect;303(i) of the Code).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> provides flexibility as to who will preside at the meeting of creditors. The court may designate a person to serve as presiding officer, such as the interim trustee appointed under &sect;701 of the Code. If the court does not designate anyone, the clerk will preside. In either case, creditors may elect a person of their own choosing. In any event, the clerk may remain to record the proceedings and take appearances. Use of the clerk is not contrary to the legislative policy of &sect;341(c). The judge remains insulated from any information coming forth at the meeting and any information obtained by the clerk must not be relayed to the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the clerk may preside at the meeting, the clerk is not performing any kind of judicial role, nor should the clerk give any semblance of performing such a role. It would be pretentious for the clerk to ascend the bench, don a robe or be addressed as &ldquo;your honor&rdquo;. The clerk should not appear to parties or others as any type of judicial officer.</p>
<p class="note-body">In a chapter 11 case, if a committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed pursuant to &sect;1102(a)(1) of the Code and a chairman has been selected, the chairman will preside or a person, such as the attorney for the committee, may be designated to preside by the chairman.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the judge must fix the bond of the trustee but cannot be present at the meeting, the rule allows the creditors to recommend the amount of the bond. They should be able to obtain relevant information concerning the extent of assets of the debtor at the meeting.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) authorizes the presiding officer to administer oaths. This is important because the debtor's examination must be under oath.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) has application only in a chapter 7 case. That is the only type of case under the Code that permits election of a trustee or committee. In all other cases, no vote is taken at the meeting of creditors. If it is necessary for the court to make a determination with respect to a claim, the meeting may be adjourned until the objection or dispute is resolved.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence recognizes that partnership creditors may vote for a trustee of a partner's estate along with the separate creditors of the partner. Although &sect;723(c) gives the trustee of a partnership a claim against a partner's estate for the full amount of partnership creditors&rsquo; claims allowed, the purpose and function of this provision are to simplify distribution and prevent double proof, not to disfranchise partnership creditors in electing a trustee of an estate against which they hold allowable claims.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> requires minutes and a record of the meeting to be maintained by the presiding officer. A verbatim record must be made of the debtor's examination but the rule is flexible as to the means used to record the examination.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> recognizes that the court must be informed immediately about the election or nonelection of a trustee in a chapter 7 case. Pursuant to Rule 2008, the clerk officially informs the trustee of his election or appointment and how he is to qualify. The presiding person has no authority to resolve a disputed election.</p>
<p class="note-body">For purposes of expediency, the results of the election should be obtained for each alternative presented by the dispute and immediately reported to the court. Thus, when an interested party presents the dispute to the court, its prompt resolution by the court will determine the dispute and a new or adjourned meeting to conduct the election may be avoided. The clerk is not an interested party.</p>
<p class="note-body">A creditors&rsquo; committee may be elected only in a chapter 7 case. In chapter 11 cases, a creditors&rsquo; committee is appointed pursuant to &sect;1102.</p>
<p class="note-body">While a final meeting is not required, Rule 2002(f)(10) provides for the trustee's final account to be sent to creditors.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Many courts schedule meetings of creditors at various locations in the district. Because the clerk must schedule meetings at those locations, an additional 20 days for scheduling the meetings is provided under the amended rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (a) relating to the calling of the meeting of creditors in a chapter 12 case is consistent with the expedited procedures of chapter 12. Subdivision (a) is also amended to clarify that the United States trustee does not call a meeting of creditors in a chapter 9 case. Pursuant to &sect;901(a) of the Code, &sect;341 is inapplicable in chapter 9 cases. The other amendments to subdivisions (a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) and the additions of subdivisions (f) and (g) are derived from Rule X&ndash;1006 and conform to the 1986 amendments to &sect;341 of the Code. The second sentence of subdivision (b)(3) is amended because Rule 2009(e) is abrogated. Although the United States trustee fixes the date for the meeting, the clerk of the bankruptcy court transmits the notice of the meeting unless the court orders otherwise, as prescribed in Rule 2002(a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to &sect;702 and &sect;705 of the Code, creditors may elect a trustee and a committee in a chapter 7 case. Subdivision (b) of this rule provides that the United States trustee shall preside over any election that is held under those sections. The deletion of the last sentence of subdivision (b)(1) does not preclude creditors from recommending to the United States trustee the amount of the trustee's bond when a trustee is elected. Trustees and committees are not elected in chapter 11, 12, and 13 cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">If an election is disputed, the United States trustee shall not resolve the dispute. For purposes of expediency, the United States trustee shall tabulate the results of the election for each alternative presented by the dispute. However, if the court finds that such tabulation is not feasible under the circumstances, the United States trustee need not tabulate the votes. If such tabulation is feasible and if the disputed vote or votes would affect the result of the election, the tabulations of votes for each alternative presented by the dispute shall be reported to the court. If a motion is made for resolution of the dispute in accordance with subdivision (d) of this rule, the court will determine the issue and another meeting to conduct the election may not be necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (f) and (g)</em> are derived from Rule X&ndash;1006(d) and (e), except that the amount is increased to $1,500 to conform to the amendment to Rule 2002(f).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to extend by ten days the time for holding the meeting of creditors in a chapter 13 case. This extension will provide more flexibility for scheduling the meeting of creditors. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to require the United States trustee to mail a copy of a report of a disputed election to any party in interest that has requested a copy of it. Also, if the election is for a trustee, the rule as amended will give a party in interest ten days from the filing of the report, rather than from the date of the meeting of creditors, to file a motion to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p class="note-body">The substitution of &ldquo;United States trustee&rdquo; for &ldquo;presiding officer&rdquo; is stylistic. Section 341(a) of the Code provides that the United States trustee shall preside at <!-- PDFPage:26 -->the meeting of creditors. Other amendments are designed to conform to the style of Rule 2007.1(b)(3) regarding the election of a trustee in a chapter 11 case.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The examination of an entity under this rule or of the debtor under &sect;343 of the Code may relate only to the acts, conduct, or property or to the liabilities and financial condition of the debtor, or to any matter which may affect the administration of the debtor's estate, or to the debtor's right to a discharge. In a family farmer's debt adjustment case under chapter 12, an individual's debt adjustment case under chapter 13, or a reorganization case under chapter 11 of the Code, other than for the reorganization of a railroad, the examination may also relate to the operation of any business and the desirability of its continuance, the source of any money or property acquired or to be acquired by the debtor for purposes of consummating a plan and the consideration given or offered therefor, and any other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation of a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compelling Attendance and Production of Documentary Evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The attendance of an entity for examination and the production of documentary evidence may be compelled in the manner provided in Rule 9016 for the attendance of witnesses at a hearing or trial.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time and Place of Examination of Debtor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The court may for cause shown and on terms as it may impose order the debtor to be examined under this rule at any time or place it designates, whether within or without the district wherein the case is pending.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Mileage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An entity other than a debtor shall not be required to attend as a witness unless lawful mileage and witness fee for one day's attendance shall be first tendered. If the debtor resides more than 100 miles from the place of examination when required to appear for an examination under this rule, the mileage allowed by law to a witness shall be tendered for any distance more than 100 miles from the debtor's residence at the date of the filing of the first petition commencing a case under the Code or the residence at the time the debtor is required to appear for the examination, whichever is the lesser.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Order To Compel Attendance for Examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion of any party in interest supported by an affidavit alleging (1) that the examination of the debtor is necessary for the proper administration of the estate and that there is reasonable cause to believe that the debtor is about to leave or has left the debtor's residence or principal place of business to avoid examination, or (2) that the debtor has evaded service of a subpoena or of an order to attend for examination, or (3) that the debtor has willfully disobeyed a subpoena or order to attend for examination, duly served, the court may issue to the marshal, or some other officer authorized by law, an order directing the officer to bring the debtor before the court without unnecessary delay. If, after hearing, the court finds the allegations to be true, the court shall thereupon cause the debtor to be examined forthwith. If necessary, the court shall fix conditions for further examination and for the debtor's obedience to all orders made in reference thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any order to bring the debtor before the court is issued under this rule and the debtor is found in a district other than that of the court issuing the order, the debtor may be taken into custody under the order and removed in accordance with the following rules:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the debtor is taken into custody under the order at a place less than 100 miles from the place of issue of the order, the debtor shall <!-- PDFPage:27 -->be brought forthwith before the court that issued the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the debtor is taken into custody under the order at a place 100 miles or more from the place of issue of the order, the debtor shall be brought without unnecessary delay before the nearest available United States magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge. If, after hearing, the magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge finds that an order has issued under this rule and that the person in custody is the debtor, or if the person in custody waives a hearing, the magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, or district judge shall order removal, and the person in custody shall be released on conditions ensuring prompt appearance before the court that issued the order to compel the attendance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conditions of Release</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2006. Solicitation and Voting of Proxies in Chapter 7 Liquidation Cases</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This rule applies only in a liquidation case pending under chapter 7 of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Proxy</em>. A proxy is a written power of attorney authorizing any entity to vote the claim or otherwise act as the owner's attorney in fact in connection with the administration of the estate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Solicitation of Proxy</em>. The solicitation of a proxy is any communication, other than one from an attorney to a regular client who owns a claim or from an attorney to the owner of a claim who has requested the attorney to represent the owner, by which a creditor is asked, directly or indirectly, to give a proxy after or in contemplation of the filing of a petition by or against the debtor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorized Solicitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A proxy may be solicited only by (A) a creditor owning an allowable unsecured claim against the estate on the date of the filing of the petition; (B) a committee elected pursuant to &sect;705 of the Code; (C) a committee of creditors selected by a majority in number and amount of claims of creditors (i) whose claims are not contingent or unliquidated, (ii) who are not disqualified from voting under &sect;702(a) of the Code and (iii) who were present or represented at a meeting of which all creditors having claims of over $500 or the 100 creditors having the largest claims had at least five days notice in writing and of which meeting written minutes were kept and are available reporting the names of the creditors present or represented and voting and the amounts of their claims; or (D) a bona fide trade or credit association, but such association may solicit only creditors who were its members or subscribers in good standing and had allowable unsecured claims on the date of the filing of the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A proxy may be solicited only in writing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Solicitation Not Authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This rule does not permit solicitation (1) in any interest other than that of general creditors; (2) by or on behalf of any custodian; (3) by the interim trustee or by or on behalf of any entity not qualified to vote under &sect;702(a) of the Code; (4) by or on behalf of an attorney at law; or (5) by or on behalf of a transferee of a claim for collection only.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Data Required From Holders of Multiple Proxies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time before the voting commences at any meeting of creditors pursuant to &sect;341(a) of the Code, or at any other time as the court may direct, a holder of two or more proxies shall file and transmit to the United States trustee a verified list of the proxies to be voted and a verified statement of the pertinent facts and circumstances in connection with the execution and delivery of each proxy, including:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a copy of the solicitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) identification of the solicitor, the forwarder, if the forwarder is neither the solicitor nor the owner of the claim, and the proxyholder, including their connections with the debtor and with each other. If the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder is an association, there shall also be included a statement that the creditors whose claims have been solicited and the creditors whose claims are to be voted were members or subscribers in good standing and had allowable unsecured claims on the date of the filing of the petition. If the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder is a committee of creditors, the statement shall also set forth the date and place the committee was organized, that the committee was organized in accordance with clause (B) or (C) of paragraph (c)(1) of this rule, the members of the committee, the amounts of their claims, when the <!-- PDFPage:28 -->claims were acquired, the amounts paid therefor, and the extent to which the claims of the committee members are secured or entitled to priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a statement that no consideration has been paid or promised by the proxyholder for the proxy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a statement as to whether there is any agreement and, if so, the particulars thereof, between the proxyholder and any other entity for the payment of any consideration in connection with voting the proxy, or for the sharing of compensation with any entity, other than a member or regular associate of the proxyholder's law firm, which may be allowed the trustee or any entity for services rendered in the case, or for the employment of any person as attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other employee for the estate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if the proxy was solicited by an entity other than the proxyholder, or forwarded to the holder by an entity who is neither a solicitor of the proxy nor the owner of the claim, a statement signed and verified by the solicitor or forwarder that no consideration has been paid or promised for the proxy, and whether there is any agreement, and, if so, the particulars thereof, between the solicitor or forwarder and any other entity for the payment of any consideration in connection with voting the proxy, or for sharing compensation with any entity other than a member or regular associate of the solicitor's or forwarder's law firm which may be allowed the trustee or any entity for services rendered in the case, or for the employment of any person as attorney, accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, or other employee for the estate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) if the solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder is a committee, a statement signed and verified by each member as to the amount and source of any consideration paid or to be paid to such member in connection with the case other than by way of dividend on the member's claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enforcement of Restrictions on Solicitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion of any party in interest or on its own initiative, the court may determine whether there has been a failure to comply with the provisions of this rule or any other impropriety in connection with the solicitation or voting of a proxy. After notice and a hearing the court may reject any proxy for cause, vacate any order entered in consequence of the voting of any proxy which should have been rejected, or take any other appropriate action.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is a comprehensive regulation of solicitation and voting of proxies in liquidation cases. It is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 208. The rule applies only in chapter 7 cases because no voting occurs, other than on a plan, in a chapter 11 case. Former Bankruptcy Rule 208 did not apply to solicitations of acceptances of plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">Creditor control was a basic feature of the Act and is continued, in part, by the Code. Creditor democracy is perverted and the congressional objective frustrated, however, if control of administration falls into the hands of persons whose principal interest is not in what the estate can be made to yield to the unsecured creditors but in what it can yield to those involved in its administration or in other ulterior objectives.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The definition of proxy in the first paragraph of subdivision (b) is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 208.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The purpose of the rule is to protect creditors against loss of control of administration of their debtors&rsquo; estates to holders of proxies having interests that differ from those of the creditors. The rule does not prohibit solicitation but restricts it to those who were creditors at the commencement of the case or their freely and fairly selected representatives. The special role occupied by credit and trade associations is recognized in the last clause of subdivision (c)(1). On the assumption that members or subscribers may have affiliated with an association in part for the purpose of obtaining its services as a representative in liquidation proceedings, an established association is authorized to solicit its own members, or its regular customers or clients, who were creditors on the date of the filing of the petition. Although the association may not solicit nonmembers or nonsubscribers for proxies, it may sponsor a meeting of creditors at which a committee entitled to solicit proxies may be selected in accordance with clause (C) of subdivision (c)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under certain circumstances, the relationship of a creditor, creditors&rsquo; committee, or association to the estate or the case may be such as to warrant rejection of any proxy solicited by such a person or group. Thus a person who is forbidden by the Code to vote his own claim should be equally disabled to solicit proxies from creditors. Solicitation by or on behalf of the debtor has been uniformly condemned, <em>e.g., In re White</em>, 15 F.2d 371 (9th Cir. 1926), as has solicitation on behalf of a preferred creditor, <em>Matter of Law</em>, 13 Am.B.R. 650 (S.D. Ill. 1905). The prohibition on solicitation by a receiver or his attorney made explicit by General Order 39 has been collaterally supported by rulings rejecting proxies solicited by a receiver in equity, <em>In re Western States Bldg.-Loan Ass'n</em>, 54 F.2d 415 (S.D. Cal. 1931), and by an assignee for the benefit of creditors, <em>Lines v. Falstaff Brewing Co</em>., 233 F.2d 927 (9th Cir. 1956).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> prohibits solicitation by any person or group having a relationship described in the preceding paragraph. It also makes no exception for attorneys or transferees of claims for collection. The rule does not undertake to regulate communications between an attorney and his regular client or between an attorney and a creditor who has asked the attorney to represent him in a proceeding under the Code, but any other communication by an attorney or any other person or group requesting a proxy from the owner of a claim constitutes a regulated solicitation. Solicitation by an attorney of a proxy from a creditor who was not a client prior to the solicitation is objectionable not only as unethical conduct as recognized by such cases as <em>In the Matter of Darland Company</em>, 184 F. Supp. 760 (S.D. Iowa 1960) but also and more importantly because the practice carries a substantial risk that administration will fall into the hands of those whose interest is in obtaining fees from the estate rather than securing dividends for creditors. The same risk attaches to solicitation by the holder of a claim for collection only.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. The regulation of solicitation and voting of proxies is achieved by the rule principally through the imposition of requirements of disclosure on the holders of two or more proxies. The disclosures must be made to the clerk before the meeting at which the proxies are to be voted to afford the clerk or a party in interest an opportunity to examine the circumstances accompanying the acquisition of the proxies in advance of any exercise of the proxies. In the light of the examination the clerk or a party in interest should bring to the attention of the judge any question that arises and the judge may permit the proxies that comply with the rule to be voted and reject those that do not unless the holders can effect or establish compliance in such manner as the court shall prescribe. <!-- PDFPage:29 -->The holders of single proxies are excused from the disclosure requirements because of the insubstantiality of the risk that such proxies have been solicited, or will be voted, in an interest other than that of general creditors.</p>
<p class="note-body">Every holder of two or more proxies must include in the submission a verified statement that no consideration has been paid or promised for the proxy, either by the proxyholder or the solicitor or any forwarder of the proxy. Any payment or promise of consideration for a proxy would be conclusive evidence of a purpose to acquire control of the administration of an estate for an ulterior purpose. The holder of multiple proxies must also include in the submission a verified statement as to whether there is any agreement by the holder, the solicitor, or any forwarder of the proxy for the employment of any person in the administration of an estate or for the sharing of any compensation allowed in connection with the administration of the estate. The provisions requiring these statements implement the policy of the Code expressed in &sect;504 as well as the policy of this rule to deter the acquisition of proxies for the purpose of obtaining a share in the outlays for administration. Finally the facts as to any consideration moving or promised to any member of a committee which functions as a solicitor, forwarder, or proxyholder must be disclosed by the proxyholder. Such information would be of significance to the court in evaluating the purpose of the committee in obtaining, transmitting, or voting proxies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em> has counterparts in the local rules referred to in the Advisory Committee's Note to former Bankruptcy Rule 208. Courts have been accorded a wide range of discretion in the handling of disputes involving proxies. Thus the referee was allowed to reject proxies and to proceed forthwith to hold a scheduled election at the same meeting. <em>E.g., In re Portage Wholesale Co</em>., 183 F.2d 959 (7th Cir. 1950); <em>In re McGill</em>, 106 Fed. 57 (6th Cir. 1901); <em>In re Deena Woolen Mills, Inc</em>., 114 F. Supp. 260, 273 (D. Me. 1953); <em>In re Finlay</em>, 3 Am.B.R. 738 (S.D.N.Y. 1900). The bankruptcy judge may postpone an election to permit a determination of issues presented by a dispute as to proxies and to afford those creditors whose proxies are rejected an opportunity to give new proxies or to attend an adjourned meeting to vote their own claims. <em>Cf. In the Matter of Lenrick Sales, Inc</em>., 369 F.2d 439, 442&ndash;43 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 822 (1967); <em>In the Matter of Construction Supply Corp</em>. 221 F. Supp. 124, 128 (E.D. Va. 1963). This rule is not intended to restrict the scope of the court's discretion in the handling of disputes as to proxies.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2007. Review of Appointment of Creditors&rsquo; Committee Organized Before Commencement of the Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Motion To Review Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a committee appointed by the United States trustee pursuant to &sect;1102(a) of the Code consists of the members of a committee organized by creditors before the commencement of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case, on motion of a party in interest and after a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and other entities as the court may direct, the court may determine whether the appointment of the committee satisfies the requirements of &sect;1102(b)(1) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Selection of Members of Committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The court may find that a committee organized by unsecured creditors before the commencement of a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case was fairly chosen if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it was selected by a majority in number and amount of claims of unsecured creditors who may vote under &sect;702(a) of the Code and were present in person or represented at a meeting of which all creditors having unsecured claims of over $1,000 or the 100 unsecured creditors having the largest claims had at least five days notice in writing, and of which meeting written minutes reporting the names of the creditors present or represented and voting and the amounts of their claims were kept and are available for inspection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) all proxies voted at the meeting for the elected committee were solicited pursuant to Rule 2006 and the lists and statements required by subdivision (e) thereof have been transmitted to the United States trustee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the organization of the committee was in all other respects fair and proper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Failure To Comply With Requirements for Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After a hearing on notice pursuant to subdivision (a) of this rule, the court shall direct the United States trustee to vacate the appointment of the committee and may order other appropriate action if the court finds that such appointment failed to satisfy the requirements of &sect;1102(b)(1) of the Code.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the court to appoint as the unsecured creditors&rsquo; committee, the committee that was selected by creditors before the order for relief. This provision recognizes the propriety of continuing a &ldquo;prepetition&rdquo; committee in an official capacity. Such a committee, however, must be found to have been fairly chosen and representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> does not necessarily require a hearing but does require a party in interest to bring to the court's attention the fact that a prepetition committee had been organized and should be appointed. An application would suffice for this purpose. Party in interest would include the committee, any member of the committee, or any of its agents acting for the committee. Whether or not notice of the application should be given to any other party is left to the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> implements &sect;1102(b)(1). The Code provision allows the court to appoint, as the official &sect;1102(a) committee, a &ldquo;prepetition&rdquo; committee if its members were fairly chosen and the committee is representative of the different kinds of claims. This subdivision of the rule indicates some of the factors the court may consider in determining whether the requirements of &sect;1102(b)(1) have been satisfied. In effect, the subdivision provides various factors which are similar to those set forth in Rule 2006 with respect to the solicitation and voting of proxies in a chapter 7 liquidation case.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:30 --><h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to &sect;1102(a). The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to &sect;1102 in chapter 11 cases. Section 1102 is applicable in chapter 9 cases pursuant to &sect;901(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although &sect;1102(b)(1) of the Code permits the United States trustee to appoint a prepetition committee as the statutory committee if its members were fairly chosen and it is representative of the different kinds of claims to be represented, the amendment to this rule provides a procedure for judicial review of the appointment. The factors that may be considered by the court in determining whether the committee was fairly chosen are not new. A finding that a prepetition committee has not been fairly chosen does not prohibit the appointment of some or all of its members to the creditors&rsquo; committee. Although this rule deals only with judicial review of the appointment of prepetition committees, it does not preclude judicial review under Rule 2020 regarding the appointment of other committees.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2007.1. Appointment of Trustee or Examiner in a Chapter 11 Reorganization Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Order To Appoint Trustee or Examiner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 11 reorganization case, a motion for an order to appoint a trustee or an examiner under &sect;1104(a) or &sect;1104(c) of the Code shall be made in accordance with Rule 9014.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Election of Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Request for an Election</em>. A request to convene a meeting of creditors for the purpose of electing a trustee in a chapter 11 reorganization case shall be filed and transmitted to the United States trustee in accordance with Rule 5005 within the time prescribed by &sect;1104(b) of the Code. Pending court approval of the person elected, any person appointed by the United States trustee under &sect;1104(d) and approved in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule shall serve as trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Manner of Election and Notice</em>. An election of a trustee under &sect;1104(b) of the Code shall be conducted in the manner provided in Rules 2003(b)(3) and 2006. Notice of the meeting of creditors convened under &sect;1104(b) shall be given as provided in Rule 2002. The United States trustee shall preside at the meeting. A proxy for the purpose of voting in the election may be solicited only by a committee of creditors appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code or by any other party entitled to solicit a proxy pursuant to Rule 2006.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Report of Election and Resolution of Disputes.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <em>Report of Undisputed Election</em>. If the election is not disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a report of the election, including the name and address of the person elected and a statement that the election is undisputed. The United States trustee shall file with the report an application for approval of the appointment in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule. The report constitutes appointment of the elected person to serve as trustee, subject to court approval, as of the date of entry of the order approving the appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Disputed Election</em>. If the election is disputed, the United States trustee shall promptly file a report stating that the election is disputed, informing the court of the nature of the dispute, and listing the name and address of any candidate elected under any alternative presented by the dispute. The report shall be accompanied by a verified statement by each candidate elected under each alternative presented by the dispute, setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and any person employed in the office of the United States trustee. Not later than the date on which the report of the disputed election is filed, the United States trustee shall mail a copy of the report and each verified statement to any party in interest that has made a request to convene a meeting under &sect;1104(b) or to receive a copy of the report, and to any committee appointed under &sect;1102 of the Code. Unless a motion for the resolution of the dispute is filed not later than 10 days after the United States trustee files the report, any person appointed by the United States trustee under &sect;1104(d) and approved in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule shall serve as trustee. If a motion for the resolution of the dispute is timely filed, and the court determines the result of the election and approves the person elected, the report will constitute appointment of the elected person as of the date of entry of the order approving the appointment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval of Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order approving the appointment of a trustee elected under &sect;1104(b) or appointed under &sect;1104(d), or the appointment of an examiner under &sect;1104(d) of the Code, shall be made on application of the United States trustee. The application shall state the name of the person appointed and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other parties in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and persons employed in the office of the United States trustee. Unless the person has been elected under &sect;1104(b), the application shall state the names of the parties in interest with whom the United States trustee consulted regarding the appointment. The application shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person appointed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is added to implement the 1986 amendments to &sect;1104 of the Code regarding the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case. A motion for an order to appoint a trustee or examiner is a contested matter. Although the court decides whether the appointment is warranted under the particular facts of the case, it is the United States trustee who makes the appointment pursuant to &sect;1104(c) of the Code. The appointment is subject to approval of the court, however, which may be obtained by application of the United States trustee. Section 1104(c) of the Code requires that the appointment be made after consultation with par<!-- PDFPage:31 -->ties in interest and that the person appointed be disinterested.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee's office be revealed is not intended to enlarge the definition of &ldquo;disinterested person&rdquo; in &sect;101(13) of the Code, to supersede executive regulations or other laws relating to appointments by United States trustees, or to otherwise restrict the United States trustee's discretion in making appointments. This information is required, however, in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the appointment process and to give the court all information that may be relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in approving the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to implement the 1994 amendments to &sect;1104 of the Code regarding the election of a trustee in a chapter 11 case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Eligibility for voting in an election for a chapter 11 trustee is determined in accordance with Rule 2003(b)(3). Creditors whose claims are deemed filed under &sect;1111(a) are treated for voting purposes as creditors who have filed proofs of claim.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proxies for the purpose of voting in the election may be solicited only by a creditors&rsquo; committee appointed under &sect;1102 or by any other party entitled to solicit proxies pursuant to Rule 2006. Therefore, a trustee or examiner who has served in the case, or a committee of equity security holders appointed under &sect;1102, may not solicit proxies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures for reporting disputes to the court derive from similar provisions in Rule 2003(d) applicable to chapter 7 cases. An election may be disputed by a party in interest or by the United States trustee. For example, if the United States trustee believes that the person elected is ineligible to serve as trustee because the person is not &ldquo;disinterested,&rdquo; the United States trustee should file a report disputing the election.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is deleted from subdivision (b), redesignated as subdivision (c), to avoid any negative inference with respect to the availability of procedures for obtaining review of the United States trustee's acts or failure to act pursuant to Rule 2020.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 2017.1</em>. The published draft of proposed new subdivision (b)(3) of Rule 2017.1 [2007.1], and the Committee Note, was substantially revised to implement Mr. Patchan's recommendations (described above), to clarify how a disputed election will be reported, and to make stylistic improvements.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2009. Trustees for Estates When Joint Administration Ordered</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election of Single Trustee for Estates Being Jointly Administered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the court orders a joint administration of two or more estates pursuant to Rule 1015(b), creditors may elect a single trustee for the estates being jointly administered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right of Creditors To Elect Separate Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding entry of an order for joint administration pursuant to Rule 1015(b) the creditors of any debtor may elect a separate trustee for the estate of the debtor as provided in &sect;702 of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appointment of Trustees for Estates Being Jointly Administered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <em>Chapter 7 Liquidation Cases</em>. The United States trustee may appoint one or more interim trustees for estates being jointly administered in chapter 7 cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Chapter 11 Reorganization Cases</em>. If the appointment of a trustee is ordered, the United States trustee may appoint one or more trustees for estates being jointly administered in chapter 11 cases.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Potential Conflicts of Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On a showing that creditors or equity security holders of the different estates will be prejudiced by conflicts of interest of a common trustee who has been selected or appointed, the court shall order the selection of separate trustees for estates being jointly administered.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The trustee or trustees of estates being jointly administered shall keep separate accounts of the property and distribution of each estate.</p>

<!-- field-end:sourcecredit -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is applicable in chapter 7 cases and, in part, in chapter 11 and 13 cases. The provisions in subdivisions (a) and (b) concerning creditor election of a trustee apply only in a chapter 7 case because it is only pursuant to &sect;702 of the Code that creditors may elect a trustee. Subdivision (c) of the rule applies in chapter 11 and 13 as well as chapter 7 cases; pursuant to &sect;1104 of the Code, the court may order the appointment of a trustee on application of a party in interest and, pursuant to &sect;1163 of the Code, the court must appoint a trustee in a railroad reorganization case. Subdivision (c) should not be taken as an indication that more than one trustee may be appointed for a single debtor. Section 1104(c) permits only one trustee for each estate. In a chapter 13 case, if there is no standing trustee, the court is to appoint a person to serve as trustee pursuant to &sect;1302 of the Code. There is no provision for a trustee in a chapter 9 case, except for a very limited purpose; see &sect;926 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule recognizes that economical and expeditious administration of two or more estates may be facilitated not only by the selection of a single trustee for a partnership and its partners, but by such selection whenever estates are being jointly administered pursuant to Rule 1015. See <em>In the Matter of International Oil Co</em>., 427 F.2d 186, 187 (2d Cir. 1970). The rule is derived from former &sect;5c of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 210. The premise of &sect;5c of the Act was that notwithstanding the potentiality of conflict between the interests of the creditors of the partners and those of the creditors of the partnership, the conflict is not sufficiently serious or frequent in most cases to warrant the selection of separate trustees for the firm and the several partners. Even before the proviso was added to &sect;5c of the Act in 1938 to permit the creditors of a general partner to elect their separate trustee for his estate, it was held that the court had discretion to permit such an election or to make a separate appointment when a conflict of interest was recognized. <em>In re Wood</em>, 248 Fed. 246, 249&ndash;50 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 247 U.S. 512 (1918); 4 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;723.04 (15th ed. 1980). The rule retains in subdivision (e) the features of the practice respecting the selection of a trustee that was developed under &sect;5 of the Act. Subdivisions (a) and (c) permit the court to authorize election of a single trustee or to make a single appointment when joint administration of estates of other kinds of debtors is ordered, but subdivision (d) requires the court to make a preliminary evaluation of the risks of conflict of interest. If after the election or appointment of a common trustee a conflict of interest materializes, the court must take appropriate action to deal with it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em> is derived from &sect;5e of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 210(f) and requires that the common trustee keep a separate account for each estate in all cases that are jointly administered.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">One or more trustees may be appointed for estates being jointly administered in chapter 12 cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to this rule are derived from Rule X&ndash;1005 and are necessary because the United States trustee, rather than the court, has responsibility for appointing trustees pursuant to &sect;&sect;701, 1104, 1202, and 1302 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">If separate trustees are ordered for chapter 7 estates pursuant to subdivision (d), separate and successor trustees should be chosen as prescribed in &sect;703 of the Code. If the occasion for another election arises, the United States trustee should call a meeting of creditors for this purpose. An order to select separate trustees does not disqualify an appointed or elected trustee from serving for one of the estates.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is abrogated because the exercise of discretion by the United States trustee, who is in the Executive Branch, is not subject to advance restriction by rule of court. United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied</em>, 365 U.S. 863 (1965); United States v. Frumento, 409 F.Supp. 136, 141 (E.D.Pa.), <em>aff'd</em>, 563 F.2d 1083 (3d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied</em>, 434 U.S. 1072 (1977); see, Smith v. United States, 375 F.2d 243 (5th Cir. 1967); House Report No. 95&ndash;595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 110 (1977). However, a trustee appointed by the United States trustee may be removed by the court for cause. See &sect;324 of the Code. Subdivision (d) of this rule, as amended, is consistent with &sect;324. Subdivision (f) is redesignated as subdivision (e).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em>. Subdivision (a) gives authority for approval by the court of a single bond to cover (1) a person who qualifies as trustee in a number of cases, and (2) a number of trustees each of whom qualifies in a different case. The cases need not be related in any way. Substantial economies can be effected if a single bond covering a number of different cases can be issued and approved at one time. When a blanket bond is filed, the trustee qualifies under subdivision (b) of the rule by filing an acceptance of the office.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certified copy of an order approving the trustee's bond given by a trustee under this rule or, when a blanket bond has been authorized, of a certified copy of acceptance. This rule supplements the Federal Rules of Evidence, which apply in bankruptcy cases. See Rule 1101 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The order of approval should conform to Official Form No. 25. See, however, &sect;549(c) of the Code which provides only for the filing of the petition in the real estate records to serve as constructive notice of the pendency of the case. See also Rule 2011 which prescribes the evidentiary effect of a certificate that the debtor is a debtor in possession.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 212(f). Reference should be made to &sect;322(a) and (d) of the Code which requires the bond to be filed with the bankruptcy court and places a two year limitation for the commencement of a proceeding on the bond. A bond filed under this rule should conform to Official Form No. 25. A proceeding on the bond of a trustee is governed by the rules in Part VII. See the Note accompanying Rule 7001.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a trustee is appointed in a chapter 11 case or the debtor is removed as debtor in possession in a chapter 12 case, the trustee is substituted automatically for the debtor in possession as a party in any pending action, proceeding, or matter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Successor Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a trustee dies, resigns, is removed, or otherwise ceases to hold office during the pendency of a case under the Code (1) the successor is automatically substituted as a party in any pending action, proceeding, or matter; and (2) the successor trustee shall prepare, file, and transmit to the United States trustee an accounting of the prior administration of the estate.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) of this rule implements &sect;325 of the Code. It provides that a pending action or proceeding continues without abatement and that the trustee's successor is automatically substituted as a party whether it be another trustee or the debtor returned to possession, as such party.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) places it within the responsibility of a successor trustee to file an accounting of the prior administration of the estate. If an accounting is impossible to obtain from the prior trustee because of death or lack of cooperation, prior reports submitted in the earlier administration may be updated.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is new. The subdivision provides for the substitution of a trustee appointed in a chapter 11 case for the debtor in possession in any pending litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The original provisions of the rule are now in subdivision (b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to include any chapter 12 case in which the debtor is removed as debtor in possession pursuant to &sect;1204(a) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to require that the accounting of the prior administration which must be filed with the court is also transmitted to the United States trustee who is responsible for supervising the administration of cases and trustees. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3). Because a court order is not required for the appointment of a successor trustee, requiring the court to fix a time for filing the accounting is inefficient and unnecessary. The United States trustee has supervisory powers over trustees and may require the successor trustee to file the accounting within a certain time period. If the successor trustee fails to file the accounting within a reasonable time, the United States trustee or a party in interest may take appropriate steps including a request for an appropriate court order. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(G). The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; are deleted in subdivision (b)(2) as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The clerk shall maintain a public record listing fees awarded by the court (1) to trustees and attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers and other professionals employed by trustees, and (2) to examiners. The record shall include the name and docket number of the case, the name of the individual or firm receiving the fee and the amount of the fee awarded. The record shall be maintained chronologically and shall be kept current and open to examination by the public without charge. &ldquo;Trustees,&rdquo; as used in this rule, does not include debtors in possession.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Summary of Record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the close of each annual period, the clerk shall prepare a summary of the public record by individual or firm name, to reflect total fees awarded during the preceding year. The summary shall be open to examination by the public without charge. The clerk shall transmit a copy of the summary to the United States trustee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Rule 213. The first sentence of that rule is omitted because of the provisions in 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;586 and 604(f) creating panels of private trustees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is not applicable to standing trustees serving in chapter 13 cases. See &sect;1302 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">A basic purpose of the rule is to prevent what Congress has defined as &ldquo;cronyism.&rdquo; Appointment or employment, whether in a chapter 7 or 11 case, should not center among a small select group of individuals unless <!-- PDFPage:34 -->the circumstances are such that it would be warranted. The public record of appointments to be kept by the clerk will provide a means for monitoring the appointment process.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> provides a convenient source for public review of fees paid from debtors&rsquo; estates in the bankruptcy courts. Thus, public recognition of appointments, fairly distributed and based on professional qualifications and expertise, will be promoted and notions of improper favor dispelled. This rule is in keeping with the findings of the Congressional subcommittees as set forth in the House Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, No. 95&ndash;595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 89&ndash;99 (1977). These findings included the observations that there were frequent appointments of the same person, contacts developed between the bankruptcy bar and the courts, and an unusually close relationship between the bar and the judges developed over the years. A major purpose of the new statute is to dilute these practices and instill greater public confidence in the system. Rule 2013 implements that laudatory purpose.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is deleted. The matter contained in this subdivision is more properly left for regulation by the United States trustee. When appointing trustees and examiners and when monitoring applications for employment of auctioneers, appraisers and other professionals, the United States trustee should be sensitive to disproportionate or excessive fees received by any person.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>, redesignated as subdivision (a), is amended to reflect the fact that the United States trustee appoints examiners subject to court approval.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>, redesignated as subdivision (b), is amended to furnish the United States trustee with a copy of the annual summary which may assist that office in the performance of its responsibilities under 28 U.S.C. &sect;586 and the Code.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">An order approving the employment of attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, agents, or other professionals pursuant to &sect;327, &sect;1103, or &sect;1114 of the Code shall be made only on application of the trustee or committee. The application shall be filed and, unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, a copy of the application shall be transmitted by the applicant to the United States trustee. The application shall state the specific facts showing the necessity for the employment, the name of the person to be employed, the reasons for the selection, the professional services to be rendered, any proposed arrangement for compensation, and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all of the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States trustee. The application shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person to be employed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to include retention of professionals by committees of retired employees pursuant to &sect;1114 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee monitors applications filed under &sect;327 of the Code and may file with the court comments with respect to the approval of such applications. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(H). The United States trustee also monitors creditors&rsquo; committees in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(E). The addition of the second sentence of subdivision (a) is designed to enable the United States trustee to perform these duties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is also amended to require disclosure of the professional's connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee's office. This requirement is not intended to prohibit the employment of such persons in all cases or to enlarge the definition of &ldquo;disinterested person&rdquo; in &sect;101(13) of the Code. However, the court may consider a connection with the United States trustee's office as a factor when exercising its discretion. Also, this information should be revealed in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, especially since the United States trustee monitors and may be heard on applications for compensation and reimbursement of professionals employed under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code which is applicable in chapter 9 cases under &sect;901. In the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, a connection between the United States trustee and a professional employed by the committee should be revealed in every case, including a chapter 9 case. However, since the United States trustee does not have any role in the employment of professionals in chapter 9 cases, it is not necessary in such cases to transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the application under subdivision (a) of this rule. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(H).</p>

The statement shall include the particulars of any such sharing or agreement to share by the attorney, but the details of any agreement for the sharing of the compensation with a member or regular associate of the attorney's law firm shall not be required.

No amendments are made to delineate further the requirements of the application because the amount of detail to be furnished is a function of the nature of the services rendered and the complexity of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to require that the attorney for the debtor file the &sect;329 statement before the meeting of creditors. This will assist the parties in conducting the examination of the debtor. In addition, the amended rule requires the attorney to supplement the &sect;329 statement if an undisclosed payment is made to the attorney or a new or amended agreement is entered into by the debtor and the attorney.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to enable the United States trustee to perform the duty to monitor applications for compensation and reimbursement filed under &sect;330 of the Code. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(A).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is amended to give the United States trustee the information needed to determine whether to request appropriate relief based on excessive fees under &sect;329(b) of the Code. See Rule 2017.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; are deleted in subdivisions (a) and (b) as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payment or Transfer to Attorney Before Order for Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion by any party in interest or on the court's own initiative, the court after notice and a hearing may determine whether any payment of money or any transfer of property by the debtor, made directly or indirectly and in contemplation of the filing of a petition under the Code by or against the debtor or before entry of <!-- PDFPage:37 -->the order for relief in an involuntary case, to an attorney for services rendered or to be rendered is excessive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment or Transfer to Attorney After Order for Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion by the debtor, the United States trustee, or on the court's own initiative, the court after notice and a hearing may determine whether any payment of money or any transfer of property or any agreement therefor, by the debtor to an attorney after entry of an order for relief in a case under the Code is excessive, whether the payment or transfer is made or is to be made directly or indirectly, if the payment, transfer, or agreement therefor is for services in any way related to the case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from &sect;60d of the Act and former Bankruptcy Rule 220 and implements &sect;329 of the Code. Information required to be disclosed by the attorney for a debtor by &sect;329 of the Code and by the debtor in his Statement of Financial Affairs (Item #15 of Form No. 7, Item #20 of Form No. 8) will assist the court in determining whether to proceed under this rule. Section 60d was enacted in recognition of &ldquo;the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in employing counsel to protect him in view of financial reverses and probable failure.&rdquo; <em>In re Wood & Henderson</em>, 210 U.S. 246, 253 (1908). This rule, like &sect;60d of the Act and &sect;329 of the Code, is premised on the need for and appropriateness of judicial scrutiny of arrangements between a debtor and his attorney to protect the creditors of the estate and the debtor against overreaching by an officer of the court who is in a peculiarly advantageous position to impose on both the creditors and his client. 2 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;329.02 (15th ed. 1980); MacLachlan, <em>Bankruptcy</em> 318 (1956). Rule 9014 applies to any contested matter arising under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule is not to be construed to permit post-petition payments or transfers which may be avoided under other provisions of the Code.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to include within subdivision (a) a payment or transfer of property by the debtor to an attorney after the filing of an involuntary petition but before the order for relief. Any party in interest should be able to make a motion for a determination of whether such payment or transfer is excessive because the funds or property transferred may be property of the estate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee supervises and monitors the administration of bankruptcy cases other than chapter 9 cases and pursuant to &sect;307 of the Code may raise, appear and be heard on issues relating to fees paid to the debtor's attorney. It is consistent with that role to expect the United States trustee to review statements filed under Rule 2016(b) and to file motions relating to excessive fees pursuant to &sect;329 of the Code.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 2018. Intervention; Right to Be Heard</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Permissive Intervention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a case under the Code, after hearing on such notice as the court directs and for cause shown, the court may permit any interested entity to intervene generally or with respect to any specified matter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Intervention by Attorney General of a State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 case, the Attorney General of a State may appear and be heard on behalf of consumer creditors if the court determines the appearance is in the public interest, but the Attorney General may not appeal from any judgment, order, or decree in the case.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Chapter 9 Municipality Case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States may, or if requested by the court shall, intervene in a chapter 9 case. Representatives of the state in which the debtor is located may intervene in a chapter 9 case with respect to matters specified by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Labor Unions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 9, 11, or 12 case, a labor union or employees&rsquo; association, representative of employees of the debtor, shall have the right to be heard on the economic soundness of a plan affecting the interests of the employees. A labor union or employees&rsquo; association which exercises its right to be heard under this subdivision shall not be entitled to appeal any judgment, order, or decree relating to the plan, unless otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Service on Entities Covered by This Rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The court may enter orders governing the service of notice and papers on entities permitted to intervene or be heard pursuant to this rule.</p>

<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Rules 8&ndash;210, 9&ndash;15 and 10&ndash;210 and it implements &sect;&sect;1109 and 1164 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to &sect;1109 of the Code, parties in interest have a right to be heard and the Securities and Exchange Commission may raise and be heard on any issue but it may not take an appeal. That section is applicable in chapter 9 cases (&sect;901 of the Code) and in chapter 11 cases, including cases under subchapter IV thereof for the reorganization of a railroad.</p>
<p class="note-body">In a railroad reorganization case under subchapter IV of chapter 11, &sect;1164 also gives the right to be heard to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Department of Transportation and any state or local regulatory commission with jurisdiction over the debtor, but these entities may not appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule does not apply in adversary proceedings. For intervention in adversary proceedings, see Rule 7024. The rules do not provide any right of compensation to or reimbursement of expenses for intervenors or others covered by this rule. Section 503(b)(3)(D) and (4) is not applicable to the entities covered by this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8&ndash;210 and former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;210. It permits intervention of an entity (see &sect;101(14), (21) of the Code) not otherwise entitled to do so under the Code or this rule. Such a party seeking to intervene must show cause therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> specifically grants the appropriate state's Attorney General the right to appear and be heard on behalf of consumer creditors when it is in the public interest. See House Rep. No. 95&ndash;595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) 189. While &ldquo;consumer creditor&rdquo; is not defined in the Code or elsewhere, it would include the type of individual entitled to priority under &sect;507(a)(5) of the Code, that is, an individual who has deposited money for the purchase, lease or rental of property or the purchase of services for the personal, family, or household use of the individual. It would also include individuals who purchased or leased property for such purposes in connection with which there may exist claims for breach of warranty.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision does not grant the Attorney General the status of party in interest. In other contexts, the <!-- PDFPage:38 -->Attorney General will, of course, be a party in interest as for example, in representing a state in connection with a tax claim.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> recognizes the possible interests of the Secretary of the Treasury or of the state of the debtor's locale when a municipality is the debtor. It is derived from former Chapter IX Rule 9&ndash;15 and &sect;85(d) of the Act.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;210 which, in turn, was derived from &sect;206 of the Act. Section 206 has no counterpart in the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is derived from former Chapter VIII Rule 8&ndash;210(d). It gives the court flexibility in directing the type of future notices to be given intervenors.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to make it clear that the prohibition against appeals by labor unions is limited only to their participation in connection with the hearings on the plan as provided in subdivision (d). If a labor union would otherwise have the right to file an appeal or to be a party to an appeal, this rule does not preclude the labor union from exercising that right.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b) and (d)</em> are amended to include chapter 12.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Data Required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 9 municipality or chapter 11 reorganization case, except with respect to a committee appointed pursuant to &sect;1102 or 1114 of the Code, every entity or committee representing more than one creditor or equity security holder and, unless otherwise directed by the court, every indenture trustee, shall file a verified statement setting forth (1) the name and address of the creditor or equity security holder; (2) the nature and amount of the claim or interest and the time of acquisition thereof unless it is alleged to have been acquired more than one year prior to the filing of the petition; (3) a recital of the pertinent facts and circumstances in connection with the employment of the entity or indenture trustee, and, in the case of a committee, the name or names of the entity or entities at whose instance, directly or indirectly, the employment was arranged or the committee was organized or agreed to act; and (4) with reference to the time of the employment of the entity, the organization or formation of the committee, or the appearance in the case of any indenture trustee, the amounts of claims or interests owned by the entity, the members of the committee or the indenture trustee, the times when acquired, the amounts paid therefor, and any sales or other disposition thereof. The statement shall include a copy of the instrument, if any, whereby the entity, committee, or indenture trustee is empowered to act on behalf of creditors or equity security holders. A supplemental statement shall be filed promptly, setting forth any material changes in the facts contained in the statement filed pursuant to this subdivision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Failure To Comply; Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On motion of any party in interest or on its own initiative, the court may (1) determine whether there has been a failure to comply with the provisions of subdivision (a) of this rule or with any other applicable law regulating the activities and personnel of any entity, committee, or indenture trustee or any other impropriety in connection with any solicitation and, if it so determines, the court may refuse to permit that entity, committee, or indenture trustee to be heard further or to intervene in the case; (2) examine any representation provision of a deposit agreement, proxy, trust mortgage, trust indenture, or deed of trust, or committee or other authorization, and any claim or interest acquired by any entity or committee in contemplation or in the course of a case under the Code and grant appropriate relief; and (3) hold invalid any authority, acceptance, rejection, or objection given, procured, or received by an entity or committee who has not complied with this rule or with &sect;1125(b) of the Code.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is a comprehensive regulation of representation in chapter 9 municipality and in chapter 11 reorganization cases. It is derived from &sect;&sect;209&ndash;213 of the Act and former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;211.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from &sect;&sect;212, 213 of the Act. As used in clause (2), &ldquo;other authorization&rdquo; would include a power or warrant of attorney which are specifically mentioned in &sect;212 of the Act. This rule deals with representation provisions in mortgages, trust deeds, etc. to protect the beneficiaries from unfair practices and the like. It does not deal with the validation or invalidation of security interests generally. If immediate compliance is not possible, the court may permit a representative to be heard on a specific matter, but there is no implicit waiver of compliance on a permanent basis.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991</h4>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee performs administrative functions, such as the convening of the meeting of creditors and the appointment of trustees and committees. Most of the acts of the United States trustee are not controversial and will go unchallenged. However, the United States trustee is not a judicial officer and does not resolve disputes regarding the propriety of its own actions. This rule, which is new, provides a procedure for judicial review of the United States trustee's acts or failure to act in connection with the administration of the case. For example, if the United States trustee schedules a &sect;341 meeting to be held 90 days after the petition is filed, and a party in interest wishes to challenge the propriety of that act in view of &sect;341(a) of the Code and Rule 2003 which requires that the meeting be held not more than 40 days after the order for relief, this rule permits the party to do so by motion.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:39 --><p class="note-body">This rule provides for review of acts already committed by the United States trustee, but does not provide for advisory opinions in advance of the act. This rule is not intended to limit the discretion of the United States trustee, provided that the United States trustee's act is authorized by, and in compliance with, the Code, title 28, these rules, and other applicable law.</p>
