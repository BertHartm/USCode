<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application for and Order of Employment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order approving the employment of attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, agents, or other professionals pursuant to &sect;327, &sect;1103, or &sect;1114 of the Code shall be made only on application of the trustee or committee. The application shall be filed and, unless the case is a chapter 9 municipality case, a copy of the application shall be transmitted by the applicant to the United States trustee. The application shall state the specific facts showing the necessity for the employment, the name of the person to be employed, the reasons for the selection, the professional services to be rendered, any proposed arrangement for compensation, and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all of the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States trustee. The application shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person to be employed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Services Rendered by Member or Associate of Firm of Attorneys or Accountants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, under the Code and this rule, a law partnership or corporation is employed as an attorney, or an accounting partnership or corporation is employed as an accountant, or if a named attorney or accountant is employed, any partner, member, or regular associate of the partnership, corporation, or individual may act as attorney or accountant so employed, without further order of the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is adapted from the second sentence of former Bankruptcy Rule 215(a). The remainder of that rule is covered by &sect;327 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 215(f). The compensation provisions are set forth in &sect;504 of the Code.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to include retention of professionals by committees of retired employees pursuant to &sect;1114 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee monitors applications filed under &sect;327 of the Code and may file with the court comments with respect to the approval of such applications. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(H). The United States trustee also monitors creditors&rsquo; committees in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(E). The addition of the second sentence of subdivision (a) is designed to enable the United States trustee to perform these duties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is also amended to require disclosure of the professional's connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee's office. This requirement is not intended to prohibit the employment of such persons in all cases or to enlarge the definition of &ldquo;disinterested person&rdquo; in &sect;101(13) of the Code. However, the court may consider a connection with the United States trustee's office as a factor when exercising its discretion. Also, this information should be revealed in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, especially since the United States trustee monitors and may be heard on applications for compensation and reimbursement of professionals employed under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The United States trustee appoints committees pursuant to &sect;1102 of the Code which is applicable in chapter 9 cases under &sect;901. In the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the bankruptcy system, a connection between the United States trustee and a professional employed by the committee should be revealed in every case, including a chapter 9 case. However, since the United States trustee does not have any role in the employment of professionals in chapter 9 cases, it is not necessary in such cases to transmit to the United States trustee a copy of the application under subdivision (a) of this rule. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3)(H).</p>
