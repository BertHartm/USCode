<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Rule 19 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings, except that (1) if an entity joined as a party raises the defense that the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter and the defense is sustained, the court shall dismiss such entity from the adversary proceedings and (2) if an entity joined as a party properly and timely raises the defense of improper venue, the court shall determine, as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1412, whether that part of the proceeding involving the joined party shall be transferred to another district, or whether the entire adversary proceeding shall be transferred to another district.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule addresses a situation different from that encountered by the district court when its jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1332. Joining of a party whose citizenship is the same as that of an adversary destroys the district court's jurisdiction over the entire civil action but under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1471 the attempted joinder of such a person would not affect the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over the original adversary proceeding.</p>

<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to delete the reference to retention of the adversary proceeding if venue is improper. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;1412.</p>
