<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule combines the provisions found in former Rules 218, 10&ndash;208, 11&ndash;30 and 13&ndash;208 of the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. It specifies various duties which are in addition to those required by &sect;&sect;704, 1106, 1302 and 1304 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>subdivision (a)</em> the times permitted to be fixed by the court in clause (3) for the filing of reports and summaries may be fixed by local rule or order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This subdivision prescribes duties on either the debtor or trustee in chapter 13 cases, depending on whether or not the debtor is engaged in business (&sect;1304 of the Code). The duty of giving notice prescribed by subdivision (a)(4) is not included in a nonbusiness case because of its impracticability.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is derived from former Chapter X Rule 10&ndash;208(c) which, in turn, was derived from &sect;190 of the Act. The equity security holders to whom the reports should be sent are those of record at the time of transmittal of such reports.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to add as a duty of the trustee or debtor in possession the filing of a notice of or a copy of the petition. The filing of such notice or a copy of the petition is essential to the protection of the estate from unauthorized post-petition conveyances of real property. Section 549(c) of the Code protects the title of a good faith purchaser for fair equivalent value unless the notice or copy of the petition is filed.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to provide the United States trustee with information needed to perform supervisory responsibilities in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;586(a)(3) and to exercise the right to raise, appear and be heard on issues pursuant to &sect;307 of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(3)</em> is amended to conform to the 1986 amendments to &sect;704(8) of the Code and the United States trustee system. It may not be necessary for the court to fix a time to file reports if the United States trustee requests that they be filed within a specified time and there is no dispute regarding such time.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)</em> is deleted because the filing of a notice of or copy of the petition to protect real property against unauthorized postpetition transfers in a particular case is within the discretion of the trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new subdivision (a)(5) was added to enable the United States trustee, parties in interest, and the court to determine the appropriate quarterly fee required by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(a)(6). The requirements of subdivision (a)(5) should be satisfied whenever possible by including this information in other reports filed by the trustee or debtor in possession. Nonpayment of the fee may result in dismissal or conversion of the case pursuant to &sect;1112(b) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule X&ndash;1007(b), which provides that the trustee or debtor in possession shall cooperate with the United States trustee by furnishing information that the United States trustee reasonably requires, is deleted as unnecessary. The deletion of Rule X&ndash;1007(b) should not be construed as a limitation of the powers of the United States trustee or of the duty of the trustee or debtor in possession to cooperate with the United States trustee in the performance of the statutory responsibilities of that office.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:48 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(6)</em> is abrogated as unnecessary. See &sect;1106(a)(7) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(7)</em> is abrogated. The closing of a chapter 11 case is governed by Rule 3022.</p>
<p class="note-body">New <em>subdivision (b)</em>, which prescribes the duties of the debtor in possession and trustee in a chapter 12 case, does not prohibit additional reporting requirements pursuant to local rule or court order.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)</em> provides that the trustee in a chapter 7 case and, if the court directs, the trustee or debtor in possession in a chapter 11 case, is required to file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the debtor's property within 30 days after qualifying as trustee or debtor in possession, unless such an inventory has already been filed. Subdivisions (b) and (c) are amended to clarify that a debtor in possession and trustee in a chapter 12 case, and a debtor in a chapter 13 case where the debtor is engaged in business, are not required to file and transmit to the United States trustee a complete inventory of the property of the debtor unless the court so directs. If the court so directs, the court also fixes the time limit for filing and transmitting the inventory.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 2015</em>. No changes since publication, except for a stylistic change in the first sentence of the committee note.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)</em> is amended to provide that the duty to file quarterly disbursement reports continues only so long as there is an obligation to make quarterly payments to the United States trustee under 28 U.S.C. &sect;1930(a)(6).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other amendments are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. No changes were made.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (a)(6) implements &sect;308 of the Code, added by the 2005 amendments. That section requires small business chapter 11 debtors to file periodic financial and operating reports, and the rule sets the time for filing those reports and requires the use of an Official Form for the report. The obligation to file reports under this rule does not relieve the trustee or debtor of any other obligations to provide information or documents to the United States trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule also is amended to fix the time for the filing of notices under &sect;1518, added to the Code in 2005. Former subdivision (d) is renumbered as subdivision (e).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other changes are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. No changes were made after publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to implement changes in connection with the amendment to Rule 9006(a) and the manner by which time is computed under the rules. The deadlines in the rule are amended to substitute a deadline that is a multiple of seven days. Throughout the rules, deadlines are amended in the following manner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;5-day periods become 7-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;10-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;15-day periods become 14-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;20-day periods become 21-day periods</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&bull;&nbsp;25-day periods become 28-day periods</p>
