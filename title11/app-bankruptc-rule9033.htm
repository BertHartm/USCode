<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In non-core proceedings heard pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;157(c)(1), the bankruptcy judge shall file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The clerk shall serve forthwith copies on all parties by mail and note the date of mailing on the docket.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objections: Time for Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 10 days after being served with a copy of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law a party may serve and file with the clerk written objections which identify the specific proposed findings or conclusions objected to and state the grounds for such objection. A party may respond to another party's objections within 10 days after being served with a copy thereof. A party objecting to the bankruptcy judge's proposed findings or conclusions shall arrange promptly for the transcription of the record, or such portions of it as all parties may agree upon or the bankruptcy judge deems sufficient, unless the district judge otherwise directs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:94 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of Time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The bankruptcy judge may for cause extend the time for filing objections by any party for a period not to exceed 20 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this rule. A request to extend the time for filing objections must be made before the time for filing objections has expired, except that a request made no more than 20 days after the expiration of the time for filing objections may be granted upon a showing of excusable neglect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Standard of Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The district judge shall make a de novo review upon the record or, after additional evidence, of any portion of the bankruptcy judge's findings of fact or conclusions of law to which specific written objection has been made in accordance with this rule. The district judge may accept, reject, or modify the proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law, receive further evidence, or recommit the matter to the bankruptcy judge with instructions.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 157(c)(1) of title 28 requires a bankruptcy judge to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court when the bankruptcy judge has heard a non-core proceeding. This rule, which is modeled on Rule 72 F.R.Civ.P., provides the procedure for objecting to, and for review by, the district court of specific findings and conclusions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> requires the clerk to serve a copy of the proposed findings and conclusions on the parties. The bankruptcy clerk, or the district court clerk if there is no bankruptcy clerk in the district, shall serve a copy of the proposed findings and conclusions on all parties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from Rule 72(b) F.R.Civ.P. which governs objections to a recommended disposition by a magistrate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is similar to Rule 8002(c) of the Bankruptcy Rules and provides for granting of extensions of time to file objections to proposed findings and conclusions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> adopts the de novo review provisions of Rule 72(b) F.R.Civ.P.</p>
