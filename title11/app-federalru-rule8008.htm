<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Papers required or permitted to be filed with the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel may be filed by mail addressed to the clerk, but filing is not timely unless the papers are received by the clerk within the time fixed for filing, except that briefs are deemed filed on the day of mailing. An original and one copy of all papers shall be filed when an appeal is to the district court; an original and three copies shall be filed when an appeal is to a bankruptcy appellate panel. The district court or bankruptcy appellate panel may require that additional copies be furnished. Rule 5005(a)(2) applies to papers filed with the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel if filing by electronic means is authorized by local rule promulgated pursuant to Rule 8018.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Service of All Papers Required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Copies of all papers filed by any party and not required by these rules to be served by the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel shall, at or before the time of filing, be served by the party or a person acting for the party on all other parties to the appeal. Service on a party represented by counsel shall be made on counsel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Manner of Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Service may be personal or by mail. Personal service includes delivery of the copy to a clerk <!-- PDFPage:84 -->or other responsible person at the office of counsel. Service by mail is complete on mailing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Proof of Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Papers presented for filing shall contain an acknowledgment of service by the person served or proof of service in the form of a statement of the date and manner of service and of the names of the persons served, certified by the person who made service. The clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy appellate panel may permit papers to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service but shall require the acknowledgment or proof of service to be filed promptly thereafter.</p>
