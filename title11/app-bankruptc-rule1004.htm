<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Voluntary Petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A voluntary petition may be filed on behalf of the partnership by one or more general partners if all general partners consent to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Involuntary Petition; Notice and Summons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After filing of an involuntary petition under &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code, (1) the petitioning partners or other petitioners shall cause forthwith a copy of the petition to be sent to or served on each general partner who is not a petitioner; and (2) the clerk shall issue forthwith a summons for service on each general partner who is not a petitioner. Rule 1010 applies to the form and service of the summons.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 105 and complements &sect;&sect;301 and 303(b)(3) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> specifies that while all general partners must consent to the filing of a voluntary petition, it is not necessary that they all execute the petition. It may be executed and filed on behalf of the partnership by fewer than all.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> implements &sect;303(b)(3) of the Code which provides that an involuntary petition may be filed by fewer than all the general partners or, when all the general partners are debtors, by a general partner, trustee of the partner or creditors of the partnership. Rule 1010, which governs service of a petition and summons in an involuntary case, specifies the time and mode of service on the partnership. When a petition is filed against a partnership under &sect;303(b)(3), this rule requires an additional service on the nonfiling general partners. It is the purpose of this subdivision to protect the interests of the nonpetitioning partners and the partnership.</p>
