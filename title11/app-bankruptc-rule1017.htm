<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Voluntary Dismissal; Dismissal for Want of Prosecution or Other Cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in &sect;&sect;707(b), 1208(b), and 1307(b) of the Code, a case shall not be dismissed on motion of the petitioner or for want of prosecution or other cause or by consent of the parties prior to a hearing on notice as provided in Rule 2002. For such notice the debtor shall file a list of all creditors with their addresses within the time fixed by the court unless the list was previously filed. If the debtor fails to file the list, the court may order the preparing and filing by the debtor or other entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Dismissal for Failure To Pay Filing Fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For failure to pay any installment of the filing fee, the court may after hearing on notice to the debtor and the trustee dismiss the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the case is dismissed or the case closed without full payment of the filing fee, the installments collected shall be distributed in the <!-- PDFPage:14 -->same manner and proportions as if the filing fee had been paid in full.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notice of dismissal for failure to pay the filing fee shall be given within 30 days after the dismissal to creditors appearing on the list of creditors and to those who have filed claims, in the manner provided in Rule 2002.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A case shall not be dismissed or proceedings suspended pursuant to &sect;305 of the Code prior to a hearing on notice as provided in Rule 2002(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure for Dismissal or Conversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proceeding to dismiss a case or convert a case to another chapter, except pursuant to &sect;&sect;706(a), 707(b), 1112(a), 1208(a) or (b), or 1307(a) or (b) of the Code, is governed by Rule 9014. Conversion or dismissal pursuant to &sect;&sect;706(a), 1112(a), 1208(b), or 1307(b) shall be on motion filed and served as required by Rule 9013. A chapter 12 or chapter 13 case shall be converted without court order on the filing by the debtor of a notice of conversion pursuant to &sect;&sect;1208(a) or 1307(a), and the filing date of the notice shall be deemed the date of the conversion order for the purposes of applying &sect;348(c) of the Code and Rule 1019.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> of this rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(a). While the rule applies to voluntary and involuntary cases, the &ldquo;consent of the parties&rdquo; referred to is that of petitioning creditors and the debtor in an involuntary case. The last sentence recognizes that the court should not be confined to petitioning creditors in its choice of parties on whom to call for assistance in preparing the list of creditors when the debtor fails to do so. This subdivision implements &sect;&sect;303(j), 707, 1112 and 1307 of the Code by specifying the manner of and persons to whom notice shall be given and requiring the court to hold a hearing on the issue of dismissal.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 120(b). A dismissal under this subdivision can occur only when the petition has been permitted to be filed pursuant to Rule 1006(b). The provision for notice in paragraph (3) is correlated with the provision in Rule 4006 when there is a waiver, denial, or revocation of a discharge. As pointed out in the Note accompanying Rule 4008, the purpose of notifying creditors of a debtor that no discharge has been granted is to correct their assumption to the contrary so that they can take appropriate steps to protect their claims.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is new and specifies the notice required for a hearing on dismissal or suspension pursuant to &sect;305 of the Code. The suspension to which this subdivision refers is that of the case; it does not concern abstention of the court in hearing an adversary proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;1478(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Any proceeding, whether by a debtor or other party, to dismiss or convert a case under &sect;&sect;706, 707, 1112, or 1307 is commenced by a motion pursuant to Rule 9014.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to provide that dismissal or conversion pursuant to &sect;&sect;706(a), 707(b), 1112(a), and 1307(b) is not automatically a contested matter under Rule 9014. Conversion or dismissal under these sections is initiated by the filing and serving of a motion as required by Rule 9013. No hearing is required on these motions unless the court directs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case as authorized by &sect;1307(a) is accomplished by the filing of a notice of conversion. The notice of conversion procedure is modeled on the voluntary dismissal provision of Rule 41(a)(1) F.R.Civ.P. Conversion occurs on the filing of the notice. No court order is required.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is new and provides the procedure to be followed when a court on its own motion has made a preliminary determination that an individual debtor's chapter 7 case may be dismissed pursuant to &sect;707(b) of the Code, which was added by the 1984 amendments. A debtor's failure to attend the hearing is not a ground for dismissal pursuant to &sect;707(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to clarify that all entities required to receive notice under Rule 2002, including but not limited to creditors, are entitled to the 20 day notice of the hearing to dismiss the case. The United States trustee receives the notice pursuant to Rule 2002(k).</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;petition&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;case&rdquo; in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) to conform to &sect;&sect;707, 930, 1112, 1208, and 1307.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to conform to &sect;348(c) of the Code which refers to the &ldquo;conversion order.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (d)</em> are amended to provide procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 12 case. Procedures for dismissal or conversion under &sect;1208(a) and (b) are the same as the procedures for dismissal or conversion of a chapter 13 case under &sect;1307(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> is amended to conform to the 1986 amendment to &sect;707(b) of the Code which permits the United States trustee to make a motion to dismiss a case for substantial abuse. The time limit for such a motion is added by this subdivision. In general, the facts that are the basis for a motion to dismiss under &sect;707(b) exist at the time the case is commenced and usually can be discovered early in the case by reviewing the debtor's schedules and examining the debtor at the meeting of creditors. Since dismissal for substantial abuse has the effect of denying the debtor a discharge in the chapter 7 case based on matters which may be discovered early, a motion to dismiss under &sect;707(b) is analogous to an objection to discharge pursuant to Rule 4004 and, therefore, should be required to be made within a specified time period. If matters relating <!-- PDFPage:15 -->to substantial abuse are not discovered within the time period specified in subdivision (e) because of the debtor's false testimony, refusal to obey a court order, fraudulent schedules or other fraud, and the debtor receives a discharge, the debtor's conduct may constitute the basis for revocation of the discharge under &sect;727(d) and (e) of the Code.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is amended to clarify that the date of the filing of a notice of conversion in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case is treated as the date of the conversion order for the purpose of applying Rule 1019. Other amendments are stylistic and make no substantive change.</p>
