<p class="note-body">The suspension by &sect;108(c) of the Code of the statute of limitations affecting any debt of a debtor terminates within 30 days after the debtor is denied a discharge or otherwise loses his right to a discharge. If, however, a debtor's failure to receive a discharge does not come to the attention of his creditors until after the statutes of limitations have run, the debtor obtains substantially the same benefits from his bankruptcy as a debtor who is discharged.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule requires the clerk to notify creditors if a debtor fails to obtain a discharge because a waiver of discharge was filed under &sect;727(a)(10) or as a result of an order denying or revoking the discharge under &sect;727(a) or (d).</p>
