<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Modification of Plan Before Confirmation</cap-smallcap>. In a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case, after a plan has been accepted and before its confirma<!-- PDFPage:66 -->tion, the proponent may file a modification of the plan. If the court finds after hearing on notice to the trustee, any committee appointed under the Code, and any other entity designated by the court that the proposed modification does not adversely change the treatment of the claim of any creditor or the interest of any equity security holder who has not accepted in writing the modification, it shall be deemed accepted by all creditors and equity security holders who have previously accepted the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Modification of Plan After Confirmation in Individual Debtor Case</cap-smallcap>. If the debtor is an individual, a request to modify the plan under &sect;1127(e) of the Code is governed by Rule 9014. The request shall identify the proponent and shall be filed together with the proposed modification. The clerk, or some other person as the court may direct, shall give the debtor, the trustee, and all creditors not less than 20 days&rsquo; notice by mail of the time fixed to file objections and, if an objection is filed, the hearing to consider the proposed modification, unless the court orders otherwise with respect to creditors who are not affected by the proposed modification. A copy of the notice shall be transmitted to the United States trustee, together with a copy of the proposed modification. Any objection to the proposed modification shall be filed and served on the debtor, the proponent of the modification, the trustee, and any other entity designated by the court, and shall be transmitted to the United States trustee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule implements &sect;&sect;942, 1127 and 1323 of the Code. For example, &sect;1127 provides for modification before and after confirmation but does not deal with the minor modifications that do not adversely change any rights. The rule makes clear that a modification may be made, after acceptance of the plan without submission to creditors and equity security holders if their interests are not affected. To come within this rule, the modification should be one that does not change the rights of a creditor or equity security holder as fixed in the plan before modification.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to limit its application to chapter 9 and chapter 11 cases. Modification of plans after confirmation in chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases is governed by Rule 3015. The addition of the comma in the second sentence is stylistic and makes no substantive change.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The 2005 amendments to &sect;1127 of the Code provide for modification of a confirmed plan in an individual debtor chapter 11 case. Therefore, the rule is amended to establish the procedure for filing and objecting to a proposed modification of a confirmed plan.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication</em>. The last sentence of the published rule provided that an objection to modification of a plan is governed by Rule 9014. The sentence is deleted and the reference to Rule 9014 is moved to the first sentence of subdivision (b) of the rule. The Committee Note was revised to make the reference to the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code consistent with their identification in other Committee Notes.</p>
