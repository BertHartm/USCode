<p class="note-body">This rule is derived from former Bankruptcy Rule 310. The operative provisions of that rule, however, are contained in &sect;347(a) of the Code, requiring the trustee to stop payment of checks remaining unpaid 90 days after distribution. The rule adds the requirement of filing a list of the names and addresses of the persons entitled to these dividends. This rule applies in a chapter 7 or 13 case but not in a chapter 9 or 11 case. The latter cases are governed by &sect;347(b) of the Code which provides for unclaimed distributions to be returned to the debtor or other entity acquiring the assets of the debtor.</p>

<p class="note-body">The title of this rule is amended to include chapter 12 cases. The words &ldquo;with the clerk&rdquo; are deleted as unnecessary. See Rules 5005(a) and 9001(3).</p>
