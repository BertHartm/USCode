<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">The suspension by &sect;108(c) of the Code of the statute of limitations affecting any debt of a debtor terminates within 30 days after the debtor is denied a discharge or otherwise loses his right to a discharge. If, however, a debtor's failure to receive a discharge does not come to the attention of his creditors until after the statutes of limitations have run, the debtor obtains substantially the same benefits from his bankruptcy as a debtor who is discharged.</p>
<p class="note-body">This rule requires the clerk to notify creditors if a debtor fails to obtain a discharge because a waiver of discharge was filed under &sect;727(a)(10) or as a result of an order denying or revoking the discharge under &sect;727(a) or (d).</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment was necessary because the 2005 amendments to the Code require that individual debtors in a chapter 7 or 13 case complete a course in per<!-- PDFPage:80 -->sonal financial management as a condition to the entry of a discharge. If the debtor fails to complete the course, the case may be closed and no discharge will be entered. Reopening the case is governed by &sect;350 and Rule 5010. The rule is amended to provide notice to parties in interest, including the debtor, that no discharge was entered.</p>
