<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Order To Appoint Trustee or Examiner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a chapter 11 reorganization case, a motion for an order to appoint a trustee or an examiner pursuant to &sect;1104(a) or &sect;1104(b) of the Code shall be made in accordance with Rule 9014.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Approval of Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order approving the appointment of a trustee or examiner pursuant to &sect;1104(c) of the Code shall be made only on application of the United States trustee, stating the name of the person appointed, the names of the parties in interest with whom the United States trustee consulted regarding the appointment, and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other parties in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and persons employed in the office of the United States trustee. The application shall be accompanied by a verified statement of the person appointed setting forth the person's connections with the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, and any person employed in the office of the United States trustee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is added to implement the 1986 amendments to &sect;1104 of the Code regarding the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case. A motion for an order to appoint a trustee or examiner is a contested matter. Although the court decides whether the appointment is warranted under the particular facts of the case, it is the United States trustee who makes the appointment pursuant to &sect;1104(c) of the Code. The appointment is subject to approval of the court, however, which may be obtained by application of the United States trustee. Section 1104(c) of the Code requires that the appointment be made after consultation with parties in interest and that the person appointed be disinterested.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that connections with the United States trustee or persons employed in the United States trustee's office be revealed is not intended to enlarge the definition of &ldquo;disinterested person&rdquo; in &sect;101(13) of the Code, to supersede executive regulations or other laws relating to appointments by United States trustees, or to otherwise restrict the United States trustee's discretion in making appointments. This information is required, however, in the interest of full disclosure and confidence in the appointment process and to give the court all information that may be relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in approving the appointment of a trustee or examiner in a chapter 11 case.</p>
