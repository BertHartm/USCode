<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is adapted from former Bankruptcy Rule 404.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (a) and (b)</em> of this rule prescribe the procedure for determining whether a discharge will be granted pursuant to &sect;727 of the Code. The time fixed by subdivision (a) may be enlarged as provided in subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice referred to in subdivision (a) is required to be given by mail and addressed to creditors as provided in Rule 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body">An extension granted on a motion pursuant to subdivision (b) of the rule would ordinarily benefit only the movant, but its scope and effect would depend on the terms of the extension.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. If a complaint objecting to discharge is filed, the court's grant or denial of the discharge will be entered at the conclusion of the proceeding as a judgment in accordance with Rule 9021. The inclusion of the clause in subdivision (c) qualifying the duty of the court to grant a discharge when a waiver has been filed is in accord with the construction of the Code. 4 Collier, <em>Bankruptcy</em> &nbsp;727.12 (15th ed. 1979).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (c) takes cognizance of &sect;524(c) of the Code which authorizes a debtor to enter into enforceable reaffirmation agreements only prior to entry of the order of discharge. Immediate entry of that order after expiration of the time fixed for filing complaints objecting to discharge may render it more difficult for a debtor to settle pending litigation to determine the dischargeability of a debt and execute a reaffirmation agreement as part of a settlement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. An objection to discharge is required to be made by a complaint, which initiates an adversary proceeding as provided in Rule 7003. Pursuant to Rule 5005, the complaint should be filed in the court in which the case is pending.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Official Form No. 27 to which subdivision (e) refers, includes notice of the effects of a discharge specified in &sect;524(a) of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em>. Registration may facilitate the enforcement of the order of discharge in a district other than that in which it was entered. See 2 Moore's <em>Federal Practice</em> &nbsp;1.04[2] (2d ed. 1967). Because of the nationwide service of process authorized by Rule 7004, however, registration of the order of discharge is not necessary under these rules to enable a discharged debtor to obtain relief against a creditor proceeding anywhere in the United States in disregard of the injunctive provisions of the order of discharge.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:65 --><p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em>. Notice of discharge should be mailed promptly after the order becomes final so that creditors may be informed of entry of the order and of its injunctive provisions. Rule 2002 specifies the manner of the notice and persons to whom the notice is to be given.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is amended to conform to &sect;727(c) which gives the United States trustee the right to object to discharge. This amendment is derived from Rule X&ndash;1008(a)(1) and is consistent with Rule 2002. The amendment to subdivision (c) is to prevent a timely motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case for substantial abuse from becoming moot merely because a discharge order has been entered. Reference to the Official Form number in subdivision (e) is deleted in anticipation of future revision and renumbering of the Official Forms.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subsection (c)</em> is amended to delay entry of the order of discharge if a motion pursuant to Rule 4004(b) to extend the time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge is pending. Also, this subdivision is amended to delay entry of the discharge order if the debtor has not paid in full the filing fee and the administrative fee required to be paid upon the commencement of the case. If the debtor is authorized to pay the fees in installments in accordance with Rule 1006, the discharge order will not be entered until the final installment has been paid.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4004</em>. No changes have been made since publication, except for stylistic changes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is amended to clarify that, in a chapter 7 case, the deadline for filing a complaint objecting to discharge under &sect;727(a) is 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors, whether or not the meeting is held on that date. The time for filing the complaint is not affected by any delay in the commencement or conclusion of the meeting of creditors. This amendment does not affect the right of any party in interest to file a motion for an extension of time to file a complaint objecting to discharge in accordance with Rule 4004(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">The substitution of the word &ldquo;filed&rdquo; for &ldquo;made&rdquo; in subdivision (b) is intended to avoid confusion regarding the time when a motion is &ldquo;made&rdquo; for the purpose of applying these rules. <em>See, e.g., In re Coggin</em>, 30 F.3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1994). As amended, this rule requires that a motion for an extension of time for filing a complaint objecting to discharge be <em>filed</em> before the time has expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other amendments to this rule are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4004</em>. No changes since publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is amended so that a discharge will not be granted while a motion requesting an extension of time to file a motion to dismiss the case under &sect;707(b) is pending. Other amendments are stylistic.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>GAP Report on Rule 4004(c)</em>. No changes since publication except for style revisions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(1)(D)</em> is amended to provide that the filing of a motion to dismiss under &sect;707 of the Bankruptcy Code postpones the entry of the discharge. Under the present version of the rule, only motions to dismiss brought under &sect;707(b) cause the postponement of the discharge. This amendment would change the result in cases such as <em>In re Tanenbaum</em>, 210 B.R. 182 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1997).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comments</em>. No changes were made.</p>
