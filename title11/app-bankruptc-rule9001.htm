<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The terms &ldquo;bankruptcy clerk&rdquo; and &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; have been defined to reflect that unless otherwise stated, for the purpose of these rules, the terms are meant to identify the court officer for the bankruptcy records. If a bankruptcy clerk is appointed, all filings are made with the bankruptcy clerk. If one has not been appointed, all filings are with the clerk of the district court. Rule 5005.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is also amended to include a definition of &ldquo;court or judge&rdquo;. Since a case or proceeding may be before a bankruptcy judge or a judge of the district court, &ldquo;court or judge&rdquo; is defined to mean the judicial officer before whom the case or proceeding is pending.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 582 of title 28 provides that the Attorney General may appoint one or more assistant United States trustees in any region when the public interest so requires. This rule is amended to clarify that an assistant United States trustee, as well as any designee of the United States trustee, is included within the meaning of &ldquo;United States trustee&rdquo; in the rules.</p>
