<h4 class="note-head">Prior Provisions</h4>
<p class="note-body">Provisions similar to those in this section were contained in act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, &sect;595, 42 Stat. 983. That section was superseded by section 595 of act June 17, 1930, comprising this section, and repealed by section 651(a)(1) of the 1930 act.</p>

Provisions for searches of buildings on or near the boundary line, and for seizure and forfeiture of merchandise, and removal of the building, were contained in R.S. &sect;3107. Provisions empowering persons, authorized to make searches and seizures, to enter into or upon lands, inclosures, and buildings, were contained in R.S. &sect;3065. All of these sections were repealed by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, &sect;642, 42 Stat. 989.</p>

<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;3092, provided that no warrant for such seizure should be issued unless the complaint should set forth the character of the fraud alleged, its nature, the importations in respect to which it was committed, and the papers to be seized, and required the return of such warrant as other warrants are returned.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;3093, provided that books and papers so seized should be subject to the order of the judge, who should allow the examination of the same by the collector or any officer authorized by him, and authorized the retention by the judge of such books and papers as he might deem necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of act July 18, 1866, &sect;39, and of act Mar. 2, 1867, &sect;2, which were incorporated into these three sections, were repealed by the Anti-Moiety Act of June 22, 1874, ch. 391, &sect;1, 18 Stat. 186. These sections were repealed, therefore, by that act, it having effect as subsequent to the Revised Statutes, and as repealing any portion of the revision inconsistent therewith, by virtue of R.S. &sect;5601.</p>
