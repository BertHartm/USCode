<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the United States International Trade Commission (hereinafter referred to in this part as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) determines under section 2252(b) of this title that an article is being im<!-- PDFPage:503 -->ported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article, the President, in accordance with this part, shall take all appropriate and feasible action within his power which the President determines will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Positive adjustment to import competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this part, a positive adjustment to import competition occurs when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the domestic industry&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is able to compete successfully with imports after actions taken under section 2254 of this title terminate, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) dislocated workers in the industry experience an orderly transition to productive pursuits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The domestic industry may be considered to have made a positive adjustment to import competition even though the industry is not of the same size and composition as the industry at the time the investigation was initiated under section 2252(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petitions and adjustment plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition requesting action under this part for the purpose of facilitating positive adjustment to import competition may be filed with the Commission by an entity, including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers, which is representative of an industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A petition under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall include a statement describing the specific purposes for which action is being sought, which may include facilitating the orderly transfer of resources to more productive pursuits, enhancing competitiveness, or other means of adjustment to new conditions of competition; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) subject to subsection (d)(1)(C)(i) of this section, request provisional relief under subsection (d)(1) of this section; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:504 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) request provisional relief under subsection (d)(2) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a petition is filed under paragraph (1), the Commission shall promptly transmit copies of the petition to the Office of the United States Trade Representative and other Federal agencies directly concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A petitioner under paragraph (1) may submit to the Commission and the United States Trade Representative (hereafter in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Trade Representative&rdquo;), either with the petition, or at any time within 120 days after the date of filing of the petition, a plan to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Before submitting an adjustment plan under paragraph (4), the petitioner and other entities referred to in paragraph (1) that wish to participate may consult with the Trade Representative and the officers and employees of any Federal agency that is considered appropriate by the Trade Representative, for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of the proposals being considered for inclusion in the plan in relation to specific actions that may be taken under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A request for any consultation under subparagraph (A) must be made to the Trade Representative. Upon receiving such a request, the Trade Representative shall confer with the petitioner and provide such assistance, including publication of appropriate notice in the Federal Register, as may be practicable in obtaining other participants in the consultation. No consultation may occur under subparagraph (A) unless the Trade Representative, or his delegate, is in attendance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In the course of any investigation under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall seek information (on a confidential basis, to the extent appropriate) on actions being taken, or planned to be taken, or both, by firms and workers in the industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Regardless whether an adjustment plan is submitted under paragraph (4) by the petitioner, if the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section, any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) firm in the domestic industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) certified or recognized union or group of workers in the domestic industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) State or local community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) trade association representing the domestic industry; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) any other person or group of persons,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may, individually, submit to the Commission commitments regarding actions such persons and entities intend to take to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in paragraphs (5) and (6) may be construed to provide immunity under the antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The procedures concerning the release of confidential business information set forth in section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332(g)] shall apply with respect to information received by the Commission in the course of investigations conducted under this part, part 1 of title III of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act [19 U.S.C. 3351 et seq.], title II of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act [19 U.S.C. 4051 et seq.], title III of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, title III of the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, and title III of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. The Commission may request that parties providing confidential business information furnish nonconfidential summaries thereof or, if such parties indicate that the information in the submission cannot be summarized, the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. If the Commission finds that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the party concerned is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summarized form, the Commission may disregard the submission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigations and determinations by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a) of this section, the request of the President or the Trade Representative, the resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the Commission shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;substantial cause&rdquo; means a cause which is important and not less than any other cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 120 days (180 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If before the 100th day after a petition is filed under subsection (a)(1) of this section the Commission determines that the investigation is extraordinarily complicated, the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 150 days (210 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity <!-- PDFPage:505 -->to be present, to present evidence, to comment on the adjustment plan, if any, submitted under subsection (a) of this section, to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Factors applied in making determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In making determinations under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall take into account all economic factors which it considers relevant, including (but not limited to)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) with respect to serious injury&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the significant idling of productive facilities in the domestic industry,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the inability of a significant number of firms to carry out domestic production operations at a reasonable level of profit, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) significant unemployment or underemployment within the domestic industry;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to threat of serious injury&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a decline in sales or market share, a higher and growing inventory (whether maintained by domestic producers, importers, wholesalers, or retailers), and a downward trend in production, profits, wages, productivity, or employment (or increasing underemployment) in the domestic industry,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the extent to which firms in the domestic industry are unable to generate adequate capital to finance the modernization of their domestic plants and equipment, or are unable to maintain existing levels of expenditures for research and development,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the extent to which the United States market is the focal point for the diversion of exports of the article concerned by reason of restraints on exports of such article to, or on imports of such article into, third country markets; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) with respect to substantial cause, an increase in imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) and a decline in the proportion of the domestic market supplied by domestic producers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making determinations under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the condition of the domestic industry over the course of the relevant business cycle, but may not aggregate the causes of declining demand associated with a recession or economic downturn in the United States economy into a single cause of serious injury or threat of injury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) examine factors other than imports which may be a cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall include the results of its examination under subparagraph (B) in the report submitted by the Commission to the President under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, in determining the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with an imported article, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the extent information is available, shall, in the case of a domestic producer which also imports, treat as part of such domestic industry only its domestic production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, in the case of a domestic producer which produces more than one article, treat as part of such domestic industry only that portion or subdivision of the producer which produces the like or directly competitive article; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may, in the case of one or more domestic producers which produce a like or directly competitive article in a major geographic area of the United States and whose production facilities in such area for such article constitute a substantial portion of the domestic industry in the United States and primarily serve the market in such area, and where the imports are concentrated in such area, treat as such domestic industry only that segment of the production located in such area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the course of any proceeding under this subsection, the Commission shall investigate any factor which in its judgment may be contributing to increased imports of the article under investigation. Whenever in the course of its investigation the Commission has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable in part to circumstances which come within the purview of subtitles A and B of title VII [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq., 1673 et seq.] or section 337 [19 U.S.C. 1337] of the Tariff Act of 1930, or other remedial provisions of law, the Commission shall promptly notify the appropriate agency so that such action may be taken as is otherwise authorized by such provisions of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The term &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo; means, with respect to an article, the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive article or those producers whose collective production of the like or directly competitive article constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of such article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo; includes producers located in the United States insular possessions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;significant idling of productive facilities&rdquo; includes the closing of plants or the underutilization of production capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;serious injury&rdquo; means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The term &ldquo;threat of serious injury&rdquo; means serious injury that is clearly imminent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Provisional relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) An entity representing a domestic industry that produces a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that is like or directly competitive with an imported perishable agricultural product or citrus product may file a request with the Trade Representative for the monitoring of imports of that product under subparagraph (B). Within 21 days after receiving the request, the Trade Representative shall determine if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the imported product is a perishable agricultural product or citrus product; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:506 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there is a reasonable indication that such product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be, or likely to be, a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to such domestic industry.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Trade Representative shall request, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332(g)], the Commission to monitor and investigate the imports concerned for a period not to exceed 2 years. The monitoring and investigation may include the collection and analysis of information that would expedite an investigation under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) alleges injury from imports of a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that has been, on the date the allegation is included in the petition, subject to monitoring by the Commission under subparagraph (B) for not less than 90 days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to such imports;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall, not later than the 21st day after the day on which the request was filed, make a determination, on the basis of available information, whether increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the perishable agricultural product or citrus product are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive perishable product or citrus product, and whether either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the serious injury cannot be timely prevented through investigation under subsection (b) of this section and action under section 2253 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) At the request of the Commission, the Secretary of Agriculture shall promptly provide to the Commission any relevant information that the Department of Agriculture may have for purposes of making determinations and findings under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Whenever the Commission makes an affirmative preliminary determination under subparagraph (C), the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determination under subparagraph (C) and, if the determination is affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (E).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Within 7 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (F) containing an affirmative determination, the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (E), shall proclaim such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section alleges that critical circumstances exist and requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to imports of the article identified in the petition, the Commission shall, not later than 60 days after the petition containing the request was filed, determine, on the basis of available information, whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is clear evidence that increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the article are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) delay in taking action under this part would cause damage to that industry that would be difficult to repair.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) So long as any action taken under section 2253 of this title remains in effect, the Commission shall monitor developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the initial period during which the action taken under section 2253 of this title is in effect exceeds 3 years, or if an extension of such action exceeds 3 years, the Commission shall submit a report on the results of the monitoring under paragraph (1) to the President and to the Congress not later than the date that is the mid-point of the initial period, and of each such extension, during which the action is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the course of preparing each report under paragraph (2), the Commission shall hold a hearing at which interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon request of the President, the Commission shall advise the President of its judgment as to the probable economic effect on the industry concerned of any reduction, modification, or termination of the action taken under section 2253 of this title which is under consideration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reduction, modification, and termination of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Action taken under section 2253 of this title may be reduced, modified, or terminated by the President (but not before the President receives the report required under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section) if the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after taking into account any report or advice submitted by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section and after seeking the advice of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor, determines, on the basis that either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the domestic industry has not made adequate efforts to make a positive adjustment to import competition, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effectiveness of the action taken under section 2253 of this title has been impaired by changed economic circumstances,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">that changed circumstances warrant such reduction, or termination; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:516 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determines, after a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry submits to the President a petition requesting such reduction, modification, or termination on such basis, that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President is authorized to take such additional action under section 2253 of this title as may be necessary to eliminate any circumvention of any action previously taken under such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President may, after receipt of a Commission determination under section 3538(a)(4) of this title and consulting with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, reduce, modify, or terminate action taken under section 2253 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon request of the President, or upon petition on behalf of the industry concerned filed with the Commission not earlier than the date which is 9 months, and not later than the date which is 6 months, before the date any action taken under section 2253 of this title is to terminate, the Commission shall investigate to determine whether action under section 2253 of this title continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and whether there is evidence that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold a public hearing at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, and to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall transmit to the President a report on its investigation and determination under this subsection not later than 60 days before the action under section 2253 of this title is to terminate, unless the President specifies a different date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evaluation of effectiveness of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After any action taken under section 2253 of this title has terminated, the Commission shall evaluate the effectiveness of the actions in facilitating positive adjustment by the domestic industry to import competition, consistent with the reasons set out by the President in the report submitted to the Congress under section 2253(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the course of the evaluation conducted under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, after reasonable public notice, hold a hearing on the effectiveness of the action. All interested persons shall have the opportunity to attend such hearing and to present evidence or testimony at such hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A report on the evaluation made under paragraph (1) and the hearings held under paragraph (2) shall be submitted by the Commission to the President and to the Congress by no later than the 180th day after the day on which the actions taken under section 2253 of this title terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Action by the President under this part may be taken without regard to the provisions of section 2136(a) of this title but only after consideration of the relation of such actions to the international obligations of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission treats as the domestic industry production located in a major geographic area of the United States under section 2252(c)(4)(C) of this title, then the President shall take into account the geographic concentration of domestic production and of imports in that area in taking any action authorized under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Such worker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was entitled to (or would be entitled to if the worker applied therefor) unemployment insurance for a week within the benefit period (i) in which such total or partial separation took place, or (ii) which began (or would have begun) by reason of the filing of a claim for unemployment insurance by such worker after such total or partial separation;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Such worker, with respect to such week of unemployment, would not be disqualified for extended compensation payable under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 by reason of the work acceptance and job search requirements in section 202(a)(3) of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Such worker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) is enrolled in a training program approved by the Secretary under section 2296(a) of this title, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) in the case of a worker whose most recent total separation from adversely affected employment that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs before the date on which the Secretary issues a certification covering the worker, the last day of the 26th week after the date of such certification,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) 45 days after the date specified in subclause (I) or (II), as the case may be, if the Secretary determines there are ex<!-- PDFPage:529 -->tenuating circumstances that justify an extension in the enrollment period,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) in the case of a worker who fails to enroll by the date required by subclause (I), (II), or (III), as the case may be, due to the failure to provide the worker with timely information regarding the date specified in such subclause, the last day of a period determined by the Secretary, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the certification made with respect to such worker under subsection (c)(1) of this section is revoked under subsection (c)(2) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">no trade readjustment allowance may be paid to the adversely affected worker under this division for the week in which such failure, cessation, or revocation occurred, or any succeeding week, until the adversely affected worker begins or resumes participation in a training program approved under section 2296(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may issue a written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection (a)(5)(A) of this section if the Secretary determines that it is not feasible or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of the following reasons:</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Enrollment unavailable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The first available enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is within 60 days after the date of the determination made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rule for justifiable cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that there is justifiable cause, the Secretary may extend the period during which trade readjustment allowances are payable to an adversely affected worker under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) (but not the maximum amounts of such allowances that are payable under this section).</p>
