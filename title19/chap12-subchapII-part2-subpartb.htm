<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Such worker, with respect to such week of unemployment, would not be disqualified for extended compensation payable under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 by reason of the work acceptance and job search requirements in section 202(a)(3) of such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) 45 days after the later of the dates specified in subclause (I) or (II), if the Secretary determines there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension in the enrollment period, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) the last day of a period determined by the Secretary to be approved for enrollment after the termination of a waiver issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of subsection (a)(5) of this section and paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any week of unemployment which begins&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a private pension sponsored by an employer or labor organization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The worker is unable to participate in training due to the health of the worker, except that a waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation laws.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Enrollment unavailable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The first available enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is within 60 days after the date of the determination made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Training not available</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Agreements under section 2311</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Issuance by cooperating States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Pursuant to an agreement under section 2311 of this title, the Secretary may authorize a cooperating State to issue waivers as described in paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the trade readjustment allowance payable to an adversely affected worker for a week of total unemployment shall be an amount equal to the most recent weekly benefit amount of the unemployment insurance payable to the worker for a week of total unemployment preceding the worker's first exhaustion of unemployment insurance (as determined for purposes of section 2291(a)(3)(B) of this title) reduced (but not below zero) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any training allowance deductible under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) income that is deductible from unemployment insurance under the disqualifying income provisions of the applicable State law or Federal unemployment insurance law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adversely affected workers who are undergoing training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any adversely affected worker who is entitled to trade readjustment allowances and who is undergoing training approved by the Secretary shall receive for each week in which he is undergoing any such training, a trade readjustment allowance in an amount (computed for such week) equal to the amount computed under subsection (a) of this section or (if greater) the amount of any weekly allowance for such training to which he would be entitled under any other Federal law for the training of workers, if he applied for such allowance. Such trade readjustment allowance shall be paid in lieu of any training allowance to which the worker would be entitled under such other Federal law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deduction from total number of weeks of allowance entitlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a training allowance under any Federal law other than this chapter is paid to an adversely affected worker for any week of unemployment with respect to which he would be entitled (determined without regard to any disqualification under section 2291(b) of this title) to a trade readjustment allowance if he applied for such allowance, each such week shall be deducted from the total number of weeks of trade readjustment allowance otherwise payable to him under section 2293(a) of this title when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance. If such training allowance paid to such worker for any week of unemployment is less than the amount of the trade readjustment allowance to which he would be entitled if he applied for such allowance, he shall receive, when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance, a trade readjustment allowance for such week equal to such difference.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A trade readjustment allowance shall not be paid for any week occurring after the close of the 104-week period (or, in the case of an adversely affected worker who requires a program of remedial education (as described in section 2296(a)(5)(D) of this title) in order to complete training approved for the worker under section 2296 of this title, the 130-week period) that begins with the first week following the week in which the adversely affected worker was most recently totally separated from adversely affected employment&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to which the worker meets the requirements of section 2291(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in order to assist the adversely affected worker to complete training approved for him under section 2296 of this title, and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, payments may be made as trade readjustment allowances for up to 52 additional weeks in the 52-week period that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on additional payments for training periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trade readjustment allowance may not be paid for an additional week specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section if the adversely affected worker who would receive such allowance did not make a bona fide application to a training program approved by the Secretary under section 2296 of this title within 210 days after the date of the worker's first certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance issued by the Secretary, or, if later, within 210 days after the date of the worker's total or partial separation referred to in section 2291(a)(1) of this title.</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;benefit year&rdquo; and &ldquo;extended benefit period&rdquo; shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of applying paragraph (1)(C), a reasonable expectation of employment does not require that employment opportunities for a worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of training approved under this paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay the costs of any on-the-job training of an adversely affected worker that is approved under subsection (a)(1) of this section in equal monthly installments, but the Secretary may pay such costs, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such training does not impair existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of training which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the written concurrence of <!-- PDFPage:525 -->the labor organization concerned has been obtained,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the job for which such adversely affected worker is being trained is not being created in a promotional line that will infringe in any way upon the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such training is not for the same occupation from which the worker was separated and with respect to which such worker's group was certified pursuant to section 2272 of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the employer is provided reimbursement of not more than 50 percent of the wage rate of the participant, for the cost of providing the training and additional supervision related to the training,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the employer has not received payment under subsection (a)(1) of this section with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by such employer which failed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the employer has not taken, at any time, any action which violated the terms of any certification described in paragraph (8) made by such employer with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by such employer for which the Secretary has made a payment under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for unemployment insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A worker may not be determined to be ineligible or disqualified for unemployment insurance or program benefits under this subpart because the individual is in training approved under subsection (a) of this section, because of leaving work which is not suitable employment to enter such training, or because of the application to any such week in training of provisions of State law or Federal unemployment insurance law relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work. The Secretary shall submit to the Congress a quarterly report regarding the amount of funds expended during the quarter concerned to provide training under subsection (a) of this section and the anticipated demand for such funds for any remaining quarters in the fiscal year concerned.</p>
