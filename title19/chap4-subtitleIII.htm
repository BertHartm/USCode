<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to all cargo to be exported that is moved by a vessel carrier from a port in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Documentation required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No shipper of cargo subject to this section (including an ocean transportation intermediary that is a non-vessel-operating common carrier (as defined in section 1702(17)(B) of title 46, Appendix)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1431a_1_target" name="1431a_1">1</a></sup> may tender or cause to be tendered to a vessel carrier cargo subject to this section for loading on a vessel in a United States port, unless such cargo is properly documented pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection, cargo shall be considered properly documented if the shipper submits to the vessel carrier or its agent a complete set of shipping documents no later than 24 hours after the cargo is delivered to the marine terminal operator, but under no circumstances later than 24 hours prior to departure of the vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A complete set of shipping documents shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for shipments for which a shipper's export declaration is required, a copy of the export declaration or, if the shipper files such declarations electronically in the Automated Export System, the complete bill of lading, and the master or equivalent shipping instructions, including the Internal Transaction Number (ITN); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for shipments for which a shipper's export declaration is not required, a shipper's <!-- PDFPage:141 -->export declaration exemption statement and such other documents or information as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the time, manner, and form by which shippers shall transmit documents or information required under this subsection to the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loading undocumented cargo prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No marine terminal operator (as defined in section 1702(14) of title 46, Appendix) may load, or cause to be loaded, any cargo subject to this section on a vessel unless instructed by the vessel carrier operating the vessel that such cargo has been properly documented in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When cargo is booked by 1 vessel carrier to be transported on the vessel of another vessel carrier, the booking carrier shall notify the operator of the vessel that the cargo has been properly documented in accordance with this section. The operator of the vessel may rely on such notification in releasing the cargo for loading aboard the vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reporting of undocumented cargo</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A vessel carrier shall notify the Customs Service of any cargo tendered to such carrier that is not properly documented pursuant to this section and that has remained in the marine terminal for more than 48 hours after being delivered to the marine terminal, and the location of the cargo in the marine terminal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sharing arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For vessel carriers that are members of vessel sharing agreements (or any other arrangement whereby a carrier moves cargo on another carrier's vessel), the vessel carrier accepting the booking shall be responsible for reporting undocumented cargo, without regard to whether it operates the vessel on which the transportation is to be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reassignment to another vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, if merchandise has been tendered to a marine terminal operator and subsequently reassigned for carriage on another vessel, the merchandise shall be considered properly documented if the information provided reflects carriage on the previously assigned vessel and otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, it shall be the responsibility of the vessel carrier to notify the Customs Service promptly of any reassignment of merchandise for carriage on a vessel other than the vessel on which the merchandise was originally assigned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Multiple containers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a single shipment is comprised of multiple containers, the 48-hour period described in paragraph (1) shall begin to run from the time the last container of the shipment is delivered to the marine terminal operator. It shall be the responsibility of the person tendering the cargo to inform the carrier that the shipment consists of multiple containers that will be delivered to the marine terminal operator at different times as part of a single shipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assessment of penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whoever is found to have violated subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the United States for civil penalties in a monetary amount up to the value of the cargo, or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Seizure of undocumented cargo</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cargo that is not properly documented pursuant to this section and has remained in the marine terminal for more than 48 hours after being delivered to the marine terminal operator shall be subject to search, seizure, and forfeiture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The shipper of any such cargo is liable to the marine terminal operator and to the ocean carrier for demurrage and other applicable charges for any undocumented cargo which has been notified to or searched or seized by the Customs Service for the entire period the cargo remains under the order and direction of the Customs Service. Unless the cargo is seized by the Customs Service and forfeited, the marine terminal operator and the ocean carrier shall have a lien on the cargo for the amount of the demurrage and other charges.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect on other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed, interpreted, or applied to relieve or excuse any party from compliance with any obligation or requirement arising under any other law, regulation, or order with regard to the documentation or carriage of cargo.</p>

The entry shall set forth such facts in regard to the importation as the Secretary may require and shall be accompanied by such invoices, bills of lading, certificates, and documents, or their electronically submitted equivalents, as are required by regulation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of merchandise that is purchased and invoiced as a single entity but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is shipped in an unassembled or disassembled condition in separate shipments due to the size or nature of the merchandise, or</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1499. Examination of merchandise</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entry examination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Imported merchandise that is required by law or regulation to be inspected, examined, or appraised shall not be delivered from customs custody (except under such bond or other security as may be prescribed by the Secretary to assure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and instructions which the Secretary or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce) until the merchandise has been inspected, appraised, or examined and is reported by the Customs Service to have been truly and correctly invoiced and found to comply with the requirements of the laws of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate the packages or quantities of merchandise covered by any invoice or entry which are to be opened and exam<!-- PDFPage:175 -->ined for the purpose of appraisement or otherwise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall order such packages or quantities to be sent to such place as is designated by the Secretary by regulation for such purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may require such additional packages or quantities as the Secretary considers necessary for such purpose; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall inspect a sufficient number of shipments, and shall examine a sufficient number of entries, to ensure compliance with the laws enforced by the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Unspecified articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any package contains any article not specified in the invoice or entry and, in the opinion of the Customs Service, the article was omitted from the invoice or entry&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with fraudulent intent on the part of the seller, shipper, owner, agent, importer of record, or entry filer, the contents of the entire package in which such article is found shall be subject to seizure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without fraudulent intent, the value of the article shall be added to the entry and the duties, fees, and taxes thereon paid accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a deficiency is found in quantity, weight, or measure in the examination of any package, the person finding the deficiency shall make a report thereof to the Customs Service. The Customs Service shall make allowance for the deficiency in the liquidation of duties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Information required for release</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an examination is conducted, any information required for release shall be provided, either electronically or in paper form, to the Customs Service at the port of examination. The absence of such information does not limit the authority of the Customs Service to conduct an examination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Testing laboratories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Accreditation of private testing laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service shall establish and implement a procedure, under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, for accrediting private laboratories within the United States which may be used to perform tests (that would otherwise be performed by Customs Service laboratories) to establish the characteristics, quantities, or composition of imported merchandise. Such regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall establish the conditions required for the laboratories to receive and maintain accreditation for purposes of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall establish the conditions regarding the suspension and revocation of accreditation, which may include the imposition of a monetary penalty not to exceed $100,000 and such penalty is in addition to the recovery, from a gauger or laboratory accredited under paragraph (1), of any loss of revenue that may have occurred, but the Customs Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may seek to recover lost revenue only in cases where the gauger or laboratory intentionally falsified the analysis or gauging report in collusion with the importer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall neither assess penalties nor seek to recover lost revenue because of a good faith difference of professional opinion; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge for accreditation and periodic reaccreditation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The collection of any charge for accreditation and reaccreditation under this section is not prohibited by section 58c(e)(6) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Appeal of adverse accreditation decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A laboratory applying for accreditation, or that is accredited, under this section may contest any decision or order of the Customs Service denying, suspending, or revoking accreditation, or imposing a monetary penalty, by commencing an action in accordance with chapter 169 of title 28 in the Court of International Trade within 60 days after issuance of the decision or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Testing by accredited laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When requested by an importer of record of merchandise, the Customs Service shall authorize the release to the importer of a representative sample of the merchandise for testing, at the expense of the importer, by a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1). The testing results from a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1) that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry shall, in the absence of testing results obtained from a Customs Service laboratory, be accepted by the Customs Service if the importer of record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the merchandise in the entry. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit in any way or preclude the authority of the Customs Service to test or analyze any sample or merchandise independently.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Availability of testing procedure, methodologies, and information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Testing procedures and methodologies used by the Customs Service, and information resulting from any testing conducted by the Customs Service, shall be made available as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Testing procedures and methodologies shall be made available upon request to any person unless the procedures or methodologies are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent related to such procedures or methodologies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Information resulting from testing shall be made available upon request to the importer of record and any agent thereof unless the information reveals information which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:176 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Miscellaneous provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any reference to a private laboratory includes a reference to a private gauger; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) accreditation of private laboratories extends only to the performance of functions by such laboratories that are within the scope of those responsibilities for determinations of the elements relating to admissibility, quantity, composition, or characteristics of imported merchandise that are vested in, or delegated to, the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Detentions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in the case of merchandise with respect to which the determination of admissibility is vested in an agency other than the Customs Service, the following apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within the 5-day period (excluding weekends and holidays) following the date on which merchandise is presented for customs examination, the Customs Service shall decide whether to release or detain the merchandise. Merchandise which is not released within such 5-day period shall be considered to be detained merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service shall issue a notice to the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise no later than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the decision to detain the merchandise is made. The notice shall advise the importer or other interested party of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the initiation of the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the specific reason for the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the anticipated length of the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the nature of any information which, if supplied to the Customs Service, may accelerate the disposition of the detention.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Testing results</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon request by the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise, the Customs Service shall provide the party with copies of the results of any testing conducted by the Customs Service on the merchandise and a description of the testing procedures and methodologies (unless such procedures or methodologies are proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent or were developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes). The results and test description shall be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Seizure and forfeiture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of failure to make determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The failure by the Customs Service to make a final determination with respect to the admissibility of detained merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been presented for customs examination, or such longer period if specifically authorized by law, shall be treated as a decision of the Customs Service to exclude the merchandise for purposes of section 1514(a)(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, a protest against the decision to exclude the merchandise which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was filed shall be treated as having been denied on such 30th day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding section 2639 of title 28, once an action respecting a detention is commenced, unless the Customs Service establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for good cause, the court shall grant the appropriate relief which may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the detention and release the merchandise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) take, or cause to be taken, such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant to such investigation or inquiry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulatory audit procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In conducting a regulatory audit under this section (which does not include a quantity verification for a customs bonded warehouse or general purpose foreign trade zone), the Customs Service auditor shall provide the person being audited, in advance of the audit, with a reasonable estimate of the time to be required for the audit. If in the course of an audit it becomes apparent that additional time will be required, the Customs Service auditor shall immediately provide a further estimate of such additional time.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:190 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Before commencing an audit, the Customs Service auditor shall inform the party to be audited of his right to an entry conference at which time the purpose will be explained and an estimated termination date set. Upon completion of on-site audit activities, the Customs Service auditor shall schedule a closing conference to explain the preliminary results of the audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in paragraph (5), if the estimated or actual termination date for an audit passes without the Customs Service auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the audit, the person being audited may petition in writing for such a conference to the officer designated pursuant to regulations, who, upon receipt of such a request, shall provide for such a conference to be held within 15 days after the date of receipt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as provided in paragraph (5), the Customs Service auditor shall complete the formal written audit report within 90 days following the closing conference unless the officer designated pursuant to regulations provides written notice to the person being audited of the reason for any delay and the anticipated completion date. After application of any exemption contained in section 552 of title 5, a copy of the formal written audit report shall be sent to the person audited no later than 30 days following completion of the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply after the Customs Service commences a formal investigation with respect to the issue involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) If during the course of any audit concluded under this subsection, the Customs Service identifies overpayments of duties or fees or over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time period and scope of the audit that the Customs Service has defined, then in calculating the loss of revenue or monetary penalties under section 1592 of this title, the Customs Service shall treat the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as an offset to any underpayments or underdeclarations also identified on finally liquidated entries, if such overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize a refund not otherwise authorized under section 1520 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Service of summons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A summons issued pursuant to this section may be served by any person designated in the summons to serve it. Service upon a natural person may be made by personal delivery of the summons to him. Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering the summons to an officer, or managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. The certificate of service signed by the person serving the summons is prima facie evidence of the facts it states on the hearing of an application for the enforcement of the summons. When the summons requires the production of records, such records shall be described in the summons with reasonable specificity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special procedures for third-party summonses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;records&rdquo; includes those&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) required to be kept under section 1508 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) regarding which there is probable cause to believe that they pertain to merchandise the importation of which into the United States is prohibited.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;summons&rdquo; means any summons issued under subsection (a) of this section which requires the production of records or the giving of testimony relating to records. Such term does not mean any summons issued to aid in the collection of the liability of any person against whom an assessment has been made or judgment rendered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;third-party recordkeeper&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any customhouse broker, unless such customhouse broker is the importer of record on an entry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any attorney; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any accountant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any summons is served on any person who is a third-party recordkeeper; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the summons requires the production of, or the giving of testimony relating to, any portion of records made or kept of the transactions described in section 1508 of this title of any person (other than the person summoned) who is identified in the description of the records contained in such summons;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then notice of such summons shall be given to any persons so identified within a reasonable time before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which such records are to be examined or testimony given. Such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the summons which has been served and shall contain directions for staying compliance with the summons under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any notice required under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be sufficient if such notice is served in the manner provided in subsection (b) of this section upon the person entitled to notice, or is mailed by certified or registered mail to the last known address of such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not apply to any summons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) served on the person with respect to whose liability for duties, fees, or taxes the summons is issued, or any officer or employee of such person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to determine whether or not records of the transactions described in section 1508 of this title of an identified person have been made or kept.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any person who is entitled to notice of a summons under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall have the right&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to intervene in any proceeding with respect to the enforcement of such summons under section 1510 of this title; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:191 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to stay compliance with the summons if, not later than the day before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which the records are to be examined or testimony given&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) notice in writing is given to the person summoned not to comply with the summons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a copy of such notice not to comply with the summons is mailed by registered or certified mail to such person and to such office as the Secretary may direct in the notice referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) No examination of any records required to be produced under a summons as to which notice is required under paragraph (2) of this subsection may be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) before the expiration of the period allowed for the notice not to comply under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the requirements of such paragraph (5)(B) have been met, except in accordance with an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing examination of such records or with the consent of the person staying compliance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The provisions of paragraphs (2) and (5) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any summons if, upon petition by the Secretary, the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) List of records and information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the basis of other evidence satisfactory to the Customs Service, that the demand was substantially complied with; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of the program;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">does not produce a demanded record or information for a specific release or provide the information by acceptable alternative means, the Customs Service, in the absence of willfulness or repeated violations, shall issue a written notice of the violation to the recordkeeper in lieu of a monetary penalty. Repeated violations by the recordkeeper may result in the issuance of penalties and removal of certification under the program until corrective action, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is taken.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A notice of violation issued under subparagraph (A) shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to implement this paragraph. Such regulations may specify the time periods for compliance with a demand for information and provide guidelines which define repeated violations for purposes of this paragraph. Any penalty issued for a recordkeeping violation shall take into account the degree of compliance compared to the total number of importations, the nature of the demanded records and the recordkeeper's cooperation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Administrative review and modification of decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless a request for an accelerated disposition of a protest is filed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section the appropriate customs officer, within two years from the date a protest was filed in accordance with section 1514 of this title, shall review the protest and shall allow or deny such protest in whole or in part. Thereafter, any duties, charge, or exaction found to have been assessed or collected in excess shall be remitted or refunded and any drawback found due shall be paid. Upon the request of the protesting party, filed within the time allowed for the filing of a protest under section 1514 of this title, a protest may be subject to further review by another appropriate customs officer, under the circumstances and in the form and manner that may be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations, but subject to the two-year limitation prescribed in the first sentence of this subsection. Within 30 days from the date an application for further review is filed, the appropriate customs officer shall allow or deny the application and, if allowed, the protest shall be forwarded to the customs officer who will be conducting the further review. Notice of the denial of any protest shall be mailed in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary. Such notice shall include a statement of the reasons for the denial, as well as a statement informing the protesting party of his right to file a civil action contesting the denial of a protest under section 1514 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Request for accelerated disposition of protest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A request for accelerated disposition of a protest filed in accordance with section 1514 of this title may be mailed by certified or registered mail to the appropriate customs officer any time concurrent with or following the filing of such protest. For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, a protest which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in part within thirty days following the date of mailing by certified or registered mail of a request for accelerated disposition shall be deemed denied on the thirtieth day following mailing of such request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Request for set aside of denial of further review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a protesting party believes that an application for further review was erroneously or improperly denied or was denied without authority for such action, it may file with the Commissioner of Customs a written request that the denial of the application for further review be set aside. Such request must be filed within 60 days after the date of the notice of the denial. The Commissioner of Customs may review such request and, based solely on the information before the Customs Service at the time the application for further review was denied, may set aside the denial of the application for further review and void the denial of protest, if appropriate. If the Commissioner of Customs fails to act within 60 days after the date of the request, the request shall be considered denied. All denials of protests are effective from the date of original denial for purposes of section 2636 of title 28. If an action is commenced in the Court of International Trade that arises out of a protest or an application for further review, all administrative action pertaining to such protest or application shall terminate and any administrative action taken subsequent to the commencement of the action is null and void.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:200 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Voiding denial of protest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a protest is timely and properly filed, but is denied contrary to proper instructions, the Customs Service may on its own initiative, or pursuant to a written request by the protesting party filed with the appropriate port director within 90 days after the date of the protest denial, void the denial of the protest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any master of any vessel and any person in charge of any vehicle bound to the United States who does not produce the manifest to the officer (whether of the Customs Service or the Coast Guard) demanding the same shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000, and if any merchandise, including sea stores, is found on board of or after having been unladen from such vessel or vehicle which is not included or described in said manifest or does not agree therewith, the master of such vessel or the person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be liable to a penalty equal to the lesser of $10,000 or the domestic value of the merchandise so found or unladen, and any such merchandise belonging or consigned to the master or other officer or to any of the crew of such vessel, or to the owner or person in charge of such vehicle, shall be subject to forfeiture, and if any merchandise described in such manifest is not found on board the vessel <!-- PDFPage:235 -->or vehicle the master or other person in charge or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be subject to a penalty of $1,000: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Customs Service shall be satisfied that the manifest was lost or mislaid without intentional fraud, or was defaced by accident, or is incorrect by reason of clerical error or other mistake and that no part of the merchandise not found on board was unshipped or discharged except as specified in the report of the master, said penalties shall not be incurred. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;clerical error&rdquo; means a nonnegligent, inadvertent, or typographical mistake in the preparation, assembly, or submission (electronically or otherwise) of the manifest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any of such merchandise so found consists of heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $500 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of crude opium, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for crude opium being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $200 for each ounce thereof so found. Such penalties shall, notwithstanding the proviso in section 1594 of this title (relating to the immunity of vessels or vehicles used as common carriers), constitute a lien upon such vessel which may be enforced by a libel in rem; except that the master or owner of a vessel used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as such common carrier shall not be liable to such penalties and the vessel shall not be held subject to the lien, if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that neither the master nor any of the officers (including licensed and unlicensed officers and petty officers) nor the owner of the vessel knew, and could not, by the exercise of the highest degree of care and diligence, have known, that such narcotic drugs were on board. Clearance of any such vessel may be withheld until such penalties are paid or until a bond, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is given for the payment thereof. The provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent the forfeiture of any such vessel or vehicle under any other provision of law. As used in this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;opiate&rdquo; and &ldquo;marihuana&rdquo; shall have the same meaning given those terms by sections 802(18) and 802(16), respectively, of title 21.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any of such merchandise (sea stores excepted), the importation of which into the United States is prohibited, be so found upon any vessel not exceeding five hundred net tons, the vessel shall, in addition to any other penalties herein or by law provided, be seized and forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a)(1) of this section and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue or electronically transmit to the person concerned a notice of intent to issue or electronically transmit a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) inform such person that he will have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why such penalty claim should not be issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No notice is required under this subsection for any violation of subsection (a)(1) of this section for which the proposed penalty is $1,000 or less.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may aid or abet any other person to violate subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Clerical errors or mistakes of fact are not violations of paragraph (1) unless they are part of a pattern of negligent conduct.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a) of this section and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue to the person concerned a written notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Customs Service may not issue a prepenalty notice if the amount of the penalty in the penalty claim issued under paragraph (2) is $1,000 or less. In such cases, the Customs Service may proceed directly with a penalty claim.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No prepenalty notice in which the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud shall be issued without the prior approval of Customs Headquarters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalty claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a) of this section, as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the Customs Service shall promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, Customs shall issue a written penalty claim to such person. The written penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under clauses (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1)(A). Such person shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repetitive violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service determines that a repeat negligent violation occurs relating to the same issue, the penalty amount for the 2d violation shall be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the total actual or potential loss of revenue. The penalty amount for each succeeding repetitive negligent violation shall be in an amount not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue. If the same party commits a nonrepetitive violation, that violation shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prior disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of subsection (a) of this section before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the violation resulted from fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest applied under section 6621 of title 26 on the amount of actual revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived during the period that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) begins on the date of the overpayment of the claim; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Condition affecting penalty limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitations in subparagraph (A) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed under this subsection apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on the claim at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such longer period as the Customs Service may provide), after notice by the Customs Service of its calculation of the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Commencement of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) of this section existed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exclusivity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Penalty claims under this section shall be the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback related violation of subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Drawback compliance program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After consultation with the drawback trade community, the Customs Service shall establish a drawback compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest may participate after being certified by the Customs Service under paragraph (2).

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification</h4>

Upon the production of satisfactory proof that the applicant did not know of the seizure prior to the declaration or condemnation of forfeiture, and was in such circumstances as prevented him from knowing of the same, and that such forfeiture was incurred without any willful negligence or intention to defraud on the part of the applicant, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, or the Commissioner of Customs may order the proceeds of the sale, or any part thereof, restored to the applicant, after deducting the cost of seizure and of sale, the duties, if any, accruing on the merchandise or baggage, and any sum due on a lien for freight, charges, or contribution in general average that may have been filed. If no application for such remission or restoration is made within three months after such sale, or if the application be denied by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, or the Commissioner of Customs, the proceeds of sale shall be disposed of as follows:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property is seized by the Secretary under law enforced or administered by the Customs Service, or otherwise acquired under section 1605 of this title, and relief from the forfeiture is granted by the Secretary, or his designee, upon terms requiring the deposit or retention of a monetary amount in lieu of the forfeiture, the amount recovered shall be treated in the same manner as the proceeds of sale of a forfeited item.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of bond by regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which bond or other security is not specifically required by law, the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation or specific instruction require, or authorize customs officers to require, such bonds or other security as he, or they, may deem necessary for the protection of the revenue or to assure compliance with any provision of law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service may be authorized to enforce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions and form of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a bond is required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce, the Secretary of the Treasury may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, prescribe the conditions and form of such bond and the manner in which the bond may be filed with or, pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system, transmitted to the Customs Service, and fix the amount of penalty thereof, whether for the payment of liquidated damages or of a penal sum: <em>Provided</em>, That when a consolidated bond authorized by paragraph 4 of this subsection is taken, the Secretary of the Treasury may fix the penalty of such bond without regard to any other provision of law, regulation, or instruction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Provide for the approval of the sureties on such bond, without regard to any general provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Authorize the execution of a term bond the conditions of which shall extend to and cover similar cases of importations over such period of time, not to exceed one year, or such longer period as he may fix when in his opinion special circumstances existing in a particular instance require such longer period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Authorize, to the extent that he may deem necessary, the taking of a consolidated bond (single entry or term), in lieu of separate bonds to assure compliance with two or more provisions of law, regulations, or instructions which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce. A consolidated bond taken pursuant to the authority contained in this subsection shall have the same force and effect in respect of every provision of law, regulation, or instruction for the purposes for which it is required as though separate bonds had been taken to assure compliance with each such provision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cancellation of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury may authorize the cancellation of any bond provided for in this section, or of any charge that may have been made against such bond, in the event of a breach of any condition of the bond, upon the payment of such lesser amount or penalty or upon such other terms and conditions as he may deem sufficient. In order to assure uniform, reasonable, and equitable decisions, the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish guidelines establishing standards for setting the terms and conditions for cancellation of bonds or charges thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Validity of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No condition in any bond taken to assure compliance with any law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce shall be held invalid on the ground that such condition is not specified in the law, regulation, or instruction authorizing or requiring the taking of such bond. Any bond transmitted to the Customs Service pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system shall have the same force and effect and be binding upon the parties thereto as if such bond were manually executed, signed, and filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit of money or obligation of United States in lieu of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to permit the deposit of money or obligations of the United States, in such amount and upon such conditions as he may by regulation prescribe, in lieu of sureties on any bond required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Unless action has been taken under subparagraph (B), the appropriate customs officer shall serve notice in writing upon any customs broker to show cause why the broker should not be subject to a monetary penalty not to exceed $30,000 in total for a violation or violations of this section. The notice shall advise the customs broker of the allegations or complaints against him and shall explain that the broker has a right to respond to the allegations or complaints in writing within 30 days of the date of the notice. Before imposing a monetary penalty, the customs officer shall consider the allegations or complaints and any timely response made by the customs broker and issue a written decision. A customs broker against whom a monetary penalty has been issued under this section shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. Following the conclusion of any proceeding under section 1618 of this title, the appropriate customs officer shall provide to the customs broker a written statement which sets forth the final determination and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revocation or suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Customs Service may, for good and sufficient reason, serve notice in writing upon any customs broker to show cause why a license or permit issued under this section should not be revoked or suspended. The notice shall be in the form of a statement specifically setting forth the grounds of the complaint, and shall allow the customs broker 30 days to respond. If no response is filed, or the Customs Service determines that the revocation or suspension is still warranted, it shall notify the customs broker in writing of a hearing to be held within 30 days, or at a later date if the broker requests an extension and shows good cause therefor, before an administrative law judge appointed pursuant to section 3105 of title 5 who shall serve as the hearing officer. If the customs broker waives the hearing, or the broker or his designated representative fails to appear at the appointed time and place, the hearing officer shall make findings and recommendations based on the record submitted by the parties. At the hearing, the customs broker may be represented by counsel, and all proceedings, including the proof of the charges and the response thereto shall be presented with testimony taken under oath and the right of cross-examination accorded to both parties. A transcript of the hearing shall be made and a copy will be provided to the Customs Service and the customs broker; which shall thereafter be provided reasonable opportunity to file a post-hearing brief. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit promptly the record of the hearing along with the findings of fact and recommendations to the Secretary for decision. The Secretary will issue a written decision, based solely on the record, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for the decision. Such decision may provide for the sanction contained in the notice to show cause or any lesser sanction authorized by this subsection, including a monetary penalty not to exceed $30,000, than was contained in the notice to show cause.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Settlement and compromise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may settle and compromise any disciplinary proceeding which has been instituted under this subsection according to the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, including but not limited to the reduction of any proposed suspension or revocation to a monetary penalty.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation of actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1621 of this title, no proceeding under this subsection or subsection (b)(6) of this section shall be commenced unless such proceeding is instituted by the appropriate service of written notice within 5 years from the date the alleged violation was <!-- PDFPage:277 -->committed; except that if the alleged violation consists of fraud, the 5-year period of limitation shall commence running from the time such alleged violation was discovered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial appeal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A customs broker, applicant, or other person directly affected may appeal any decision of the Secretary denying or revoking a license or permit under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, or revoking or suspending a license or permit or imposing a monetary penalty in lieu thereof under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section, by filing in the Court of International Trade, within 60 days after the issuance of the decision or order, a written petition requesting that the decision or order be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of the petition shall be transmitted promptly by the clerk of the court to the Secretary or his designee. In cases involving revocation or suspension of a license or permit or imposition of a monetary penalty in lieu thereof under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section, after receipt of the petition, the Secretary shall file in court the record upon which the decision or order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2635(d) of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of objections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall not consider any objection to the decision or order of the Secretary, or to the introduction of evidence or testimony, unless that objection was raised before the hearing officer in suspension or revocation proceedings unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Conclusiveness of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The findings of the Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any party applies to the court for leave to present additional evidence and the court is satisfied that the additional evidence is material and that reasonable grounds existed for the failure to present the evidence in the proceedings before the hearing officer, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the hearing officer and to be presented in a manner and upon the terms and conditions prescribed by the court. The Secretary may modify the findings of facts on the basis of the additional evidence presented. The Secretary shall then file with the court any new or modified findings of fact which shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, together with a recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original decision or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the decision of the Secretary except in the case of a denial of a license or permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Failure to appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an appeal is not filed within the time limits specified in this section, the decision by the Secretary shall be final and conclusive. In the case of a monetary penalty imposed under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section, if the amount is not tendered within 60 days after the decision becomes final, the license shall automatically be suspended until payment is made to the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations by the Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe such rules and regulations relating to the customs business of customs brokers as the Secretary considers necessary to protect importers and the revenue of the United States, and to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules and regulations governing the licensing of or issuance of permits to customs brokers, the keeping of books, accounts, and records by customs brokers, and documents and correspondence, and the furnishing by customs brokers of any other information relating to their customs business to any duly accredited officer or employee of the Customs Service. The Secretary may not prohibit customs brokers from limiting their liability to other persons in the conduct of customs business. For purposes of this subsection or any other provision of this chapter pertaining to recordkeeping, all data required to be retained by a customs broker may be kept on microfilm, optical disc, magnetic tapes, disks or drums, video files or any other electrically generated medium. Pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, the conversion of data to such storage medium may be accomplished at any time subsequent to the relevant customs transaction and the data may be retained in a centralized basis according to such broker's business system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Triennial reports by customs brokers</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension and revocation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary shall transmit written notice of suspension to the licensee no later than March 31 of the reporting year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the licensee files the required report within 60 days of receipt of the Secretary's notice, the license shall be reinstated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) In the event the required report is not filed within the 60-day period, the license shall be revoked without prejudice to the filing of an application for a new license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fees and charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe reasonable fees and charges to defray the costs of the Customs Service in carrying out the provisions of this <!-- PDFPage:278 -->section, including, but not limited to, a fee for licenses issued under subsection (b) of this section and fees for any test administered by him or under his direction; except that no separate fees shall be imposed to defray the costs of an individual audit or of individual disciplinary proceedings of any nature.</p>
