<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the agreement among the recipient corporation, the lender, and the qualified trust relating to the loan meets the requirements of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee stock ownership plan does not meet the requirements of this subsection unless the governing instrument of the plan provides that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it provides that the liability of the qualified trust to repay loan amounts paid to the qualified trust may not, at any time, exceed an amount equal to the amount of contributions required under paragraph (2)(B) which are actually received by such trust,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) it provides that amounts received by the recipient corporation from the qualified trust for qualified employer securities purchased for the purpose of this subsection will be used exclusively by the recipient corporation for those purposes for which it may use that portion of the loan paid directly to it by the lender,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) it provides that the recipient corporation may not reduce the amount of its equity capital during the one year period beginning on the date on which the qualified trust purchases qualified employer securities for purposes of this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) it provides that the recipient corporation will make contributions to the qualified trust <!-- PDFPage:539 -->of not less than such amounts as are necessary for such trust to meet its obligation to make repayments of principal and interest on the amount of the loan received by the trust without regard to whether such contributions are deductible by the corporation under section 404 of title 26 and without regard to any other amounts the recipient corporation is obligated under law to contribute to or under the employee stock ownership plan.</p>

Qualified employer securities allocated to the individual account of a participant during one plan year must bear substantially the same proportion to the amount of all such securities allocated to all participants in the plan as the amount of compensation paid to such participant bears to the total amount of compensation paid to all such participants during that year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;employee stock ownership plan&rdquo; means a plan described in section 4975(e)(7) of title 26,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) &ldquo;equity capital&rdquo; means, with respect to the recipient corporation, the sum of its money and other property (in an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such property but disregarding adjustments made on account of depreciation or amortization made during the period described in paragraph (3)(D)), less the amount of its indebtedness.</p>
