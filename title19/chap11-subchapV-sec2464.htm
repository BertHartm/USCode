<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment accorded under section 2461 of this title with respect to any article or with respect to any country; except that no rate of duty may be established in respect of any article pursuant to this section other than the rate which would apply but for this subchapter. In taking any action under this subsection, the President shall consider the factors set forth in sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall, as necessary, advise the Congress and, by no later than January 4, 1988, submit to the Congress a report on the application of sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title, and the actions the President has taken to withdraw, to suspend, or to limit the application of duty-free treatment with respect to any country which has failed to adequately take the actions described in section 2462(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Withdrawal or suspension of designation as beneficiary developing country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall, after complying with the requirements of section 2462(a)(2) of this title, withdraw or suspend the designation of any country as a beneficiary developing country if, after such designation, he determines that as the result of changed circumstances such country would be barred from designation as a beneficiary developing country under section 2462(b) of this title. Such country shall cease to be a beneficiary developing country on the day on which the President issues an Executive order or Presidential proclamation revoking his designation of such country under section 2462 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Beneficiary developing country; determinations, treatment, reviews, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (7) and subsection (d) of this section, whenever the President determines that any country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has exported (directly or indirectly) to the United States during a calendar year a quantity of an eligible article having an appraised value in excess of an amount which bears the same ratio to $25,000,000 as the gross national product of the United States for the preceding calendar year (as determined by the Department of Commerce) bears to the gross national product of the United States for calendar year 1974; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:533 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has exported (either directly or indirectly) to the United States a quantity of any eligible article equal to or exceeding 50 percent of the appraised value of the total imports of such article into the United States during any calendar year;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, not later than July 1 of the next calendar year, such country shall not be treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than January 4, 1987, and periodically therafter,<sup><a href="#2464_1_target" name="2464_1">1</a></sup> the President shall conduct a general review of eligible articles based on the considerations described in section 2461 or 2462(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, after any review under subparagraph (A), the President determines that this subparagraph should apply because a beneficiary developing country has demonstrated a sufficient degree of competitiveness (relative to other beneficiary developing countries) with respect to any eligible article, then paragraph (1) shall be applied to such country with respect to such article by substituting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) &ldquo;1984&rdquo; for &ldquo;1974&rdquo; in subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) &ldquo;25 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;50 percent&rdquo; in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Not earlier than January 4, 1987, the President may waive the application of this subsection with respect to any eligible article of any beneficiary developing country if, before July 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in paragraph (1) was made with respect to such eligible article, the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) receives the advice of the International Trade Commission on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by such waiver,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) determines, based on the considerations described in sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title and the advice described in clause (i), that such waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) publishes the determination described in clause (ii) in the Federal Register.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In making any determination under subparagraph (A), the President shall give great weight to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the extent to which the beneficiary developing country has assured the United States that such country will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets and basic commodity resources of such country, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the extent to which such country provides adequate and effective means under its law for foreign nationals to secure, to exercise, and to enforce exclusive rights in intellectual property, including patent, trademark, and copyright rights.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any waiver granted pursuant to this paragraph shall remain in effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) The President may not exercise the waiver authority provided under subparagraph (A) with respect to a quantity of eligible articles entered in any calendar year which exceeds an aggregate value equal to 30 percent of the total value of all articles which entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The President may not exercise the waiver authority provided under subparagraph (A) with respect to a quantity of eligible articles entered during any calendar year beginning after 1986 the aggregate value of which exceeds 15 percent of the total value of all articles that have entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year from those beneficiary developing countries which for the preceding calendar year&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) had exported (either directly or indirectly) to the United States a quantity of articles that was duty-free under this subchapter that had an appraised value of more than 10 percent of the total imports of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) There shall be counted against the limitations imposed under clauses (i) and (ii) for any calendar year only that quantity of any eligible article of any country that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) entered duty-free under this title during such calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) is in excess of the quantity of that article that would have been so entered during such calendar year if the 1974 limitation applied under paragraph (1)(A) and the 50 percent limitation applied under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except in any case to which paragraph (2)(B) applies, the President may waive the application of this subsection if, before July 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in paragraph (1) was made, the President determines and publishes in the Federal Register that, with respect to such country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there has been an historical preferential trade relationship between the United States and such country,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is a treaty or trade agreement in force covering economic relations between such country and the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such country does not discriminate against, or impose unjustifiable or unreasonable barriers to, United States commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A country which is no longer treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article by reason of this subsection may be redesignated a beneficiary developing country with respect to such article, subject to the provisions of sections 2461 and 2462 of this title, if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the limitations in paragraph (1) (after application of paragraph (2)) during the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) This subsection shall not apply to any beneficiary developing country which the President determines, based on the considerations described in sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title, to be a least-developed beneficiary developing country.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:534 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) make a determination under subparagraph (A) with respect to each beneficiary developing country before July 4, 1985, and periodically thereafter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notify the Congress at least 60 days before any such determination becomes final.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section shall be applied for the 2-year period beginning on July 1 of the calendar year succeeding the determination year by substituting &ldquo;25 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;50 percent&rdquo;, and</p>
