<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3801. Short title and findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This chapter may be cited as the &ldquo;Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the national security of the United States. Trade is critical to the economic growth and strength of the United States and <!-- PDFPage:784 -->to its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold War, binding nations together through a series of mutual rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and peace throughout the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The national security of the United States depends on its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of the economy of the United States, such as information technology, telecommunications and other leading technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, and intellectual property. Trade will create new opportunities for the United States and preserve the unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, political, and military affairs. The United States, secured by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that dispute settlement procedures under international trade agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in such agreements. Therefore&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the recent pattern of decisions by dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body to impose obligations and restrictions on the use of antidumping, countervailing, and safeguard measures by WTO members under the Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards has raised concerns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Congress is concerned that dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body appropriately apply the standard of review contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO member of provisions of that Agreement, and to the evaluation by a WTO member of the facts where that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the establishment of the facts is proper.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Overall trade negotiating objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The overall trade negotiating objectives of the United States for agreements subject to the provisions of section 3803 of this title are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and distortions that are directly related to trade and that decrease market opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort United States trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to further strengthen the system of international trading disciplines and procedures, including dispute settlement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, and promote full employment in the United States and to enhance the global economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to ensure that trade and environmental policies are mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the environment and enhance the international means of doing so, while optimizing the use of the world's resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of children consistent with core labor standards of the ILO (as defined in section 3813(6) of this title) and an understanding of the relationship between trade and worker rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which parties to those agreements strive to ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses equal access to international markets, equitable trade benefits, and expanded export market opportunities, and provide for the reduction or elimination of trade barriers that disproportionately impact small businesses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to promote universal ratification and full compliance with ILO Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Principal trade negotiating objectives</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Trade barriers and distortions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade barriers and other trade distortions are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to expand competitive market opportunities for United States exports and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade by reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign governments directly related to trade that decrease market opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort United States trade; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier elimination agreements, with particular attention to those tariff categories covered in section 3521(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Trade in services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding trade in services is to reduce or eliminate barriers to international trade in services, including regulatory and other barriers that deny national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict the establishment or operations of service suppliers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Foreign investment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Recognizing that United States law on the whole provides a high level of protection for investment, consistent with or greater than the level required by international law, the principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding foreign investment are to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade-distorting barriers to foreign investment, while ensuring that foreign investors in the United States are <!-- PDFPage:786 -->not accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than United States investors in the United States, and to secure for investors important rights comparable to those that would be available under United States legal principles and practice, by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of national treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reducing or eliminating performance requirements, forced technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers to the establishment and operation of investments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation and compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States legal principles and practice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable treatment consistent with United States legal principles and practice, including the principle of due process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving investment disputes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes between an investor and a government through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims and to deter the filing of frivolous claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) procedures to ensure the efficient selection of arbitrators and the expeditious disposition of claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for public input into the formulation of government positions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) providing for an appellate body or similar mechanism to provide coherence to the interpretations of investment provisions in trade agreements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in the dispute settlement mechanism, to the extent consistent with the need to protect information that is classified or business confidential, by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement are promptly made public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ensuring that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions are promptly made public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) all hearings are open to the public; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) establishing a mechanism for acceptance of amicus curiae submissions from businesses, unions, and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Intellectual property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade-related intellectual property are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to further promote adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, including through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i)(I) ensuring accelerated and full implementation of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights referred to in section 3511(d)(15) of this title, particularly with respect to meeting enforcement obligations under that agreement; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The grant of trade promotion authority under this chapter is likely to increase the activities <!-- PDFPage:800 -->of the primary committees of jurisdiction in the area of international trade. In addition, the creation of the Congressional Oversight Group under section 3807 of this title will increase the participation of a broader number of Members of Congress in the formulation of United States trade policy and oversight of the international trade agenda for the United States. The primary committees of jurisdiction should have adequate staff to accommodate these increases in activities.</p>
