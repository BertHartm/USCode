<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which the merchandise is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of merchandise not sold prior to its importation into the United States, 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which it is sold in the United States to a person who is not the exporter of that merchandise,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Imposition of duty</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission, in its final determination under section 1673d(b) of this title, finds material injury or threat of material injury which, but for the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title would have led to a finding of material injury, then entries of the subject merchandise, the liquidation of which has been suspended under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title, shall be subject to the imposition of antidumping duties under section 1673 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission, in its final determination under section 1673d(b) of this title, finds threat of material injury, other than threat of material injury described in paragraph (1), or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States, then subject merchandise which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of notice of an affirmative determination of the Commission under section 1673d(b) of this title shall be subject to the assessment of antidumping duties under section 1673 of this title, and the administering authority shall release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit made, to secure the payment of antidumping duties with respect to entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the investigation has not been designated as extraordinarily complicated by reason of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated or adjustments to be considered,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the novelty of the issues presented, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the final determination in the investigation has not been postponed under section 1673d(a)(2)(A) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on the basis of information presented to the administering authority by any manufacturer, producer, or exporter in such form and within such time as the administering authority may require, the administering authority is satisfied that a determination will be made, within 90 days after the date of publication of an order under subsection (a) of this section, of the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) for all merchandise of such manufacturer, producer, or exporter described in that order which was entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an affirmative preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if its determination under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative, an affirmative final determination by the administering authority under section 1673d(a) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and before the date of publication of the affirmative final determination by the Commission under section 1673d(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the party described in subparagraph (C) provides credible evidence that the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise is significantly less than the amount of such excess specified in the antidumping duty order published under subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the data concerning the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) apply to sales in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and the number of such sales are sufficient to form an adequate basis for comparison.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the results of its determination of normal value and export price (or the constructed export price), and that determination shall be the basis for the assessment of antidumping duties on entries of merchandise to which the notice under this subsection applies and also shall be the basis for the deposit of estimated antidumping duties on future entries of merchandise of manufacturers, producers, or exporters described in paragraph (1) to which the order issued under subsection (a) of this section applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Provision of business proprietary information; written comments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) afford all interested parties an opportunity to file written comments on whether the posting of bond or other security under paragraph (1) in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties should be permitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rule for regional industries</h4>
