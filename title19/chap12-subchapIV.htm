<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 7207, July 1, 1999, 64 F.R. 36549, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The United States has had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade Relations with Mongolia since 1991 and has provided normal trade relations treatment to the products of Mongolia since that time. I have found Mongolia to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the &ldquo;Trade Act&rdquo;) (19 U.S.C. 2432).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Pursuant to section 2424(b)(1) of Public Law 106&ndash;36 [set out as a note above], and having due regard for the findings of the Congress in section 2424(a) of said Law, I hereby determine that title IV of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2431&ndash;2441) should no longer apply to Mongolia.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. On November 13, 1998, members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including the United States and 21 other major trading countries, announced in the WTO an agreement to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (the &ldquo;Uruguay Round&rdquo;). A similar agreement between the United States and 16 other major trading countries eliminating tariffs on enumerated pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates was implemented for the United States on April 1, 1997, by Proclamation 6982 [not classified to the Code], adding such goods to the scope of the agreement on pharmaceutical products reached at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and reflected in Schedule XX&ndash;United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Schedule XX).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)) authorizes the President to proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX for products that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round, if the United States agrees to such action in a multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO, and after compliance with the consultation and layover requirements of section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524). Section 111(b) also authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications as are necessary to reflect such duty treatment in Schedule XX by means of rectifications thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. On April 29, 1999, pursuant to section 115 of the URAA, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) submitted a report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate (&ldquo;the Committees&rdquo;) that sets forth the proposed tariff eliminations, together with the advice received from the appropriate private sector advisory committee and the United States International Trade Commission regarding the proposed tariff eliminations. During the 60-day period thereafter, the USTR consulted with the Committees on the proposed actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">6. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) [see 19 U.S.C. 1202] the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</p>
<p class="note-body">7. Pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined that Schedule XX should be modified to reflect the implementation by the United States of the multilateral agreement on certain pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates negotiated under the auspices of the WTO. In addition, I have determined that the pharmaceuticals appendix to the HTS should be modified to reflect the duty eliminations provided in such agreement, and to make certain minor technical corrections in the identification of particular products in order to ensure that products are accorded the intended duty treatment.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 2424(b)(2) of Public Law 106&ndash;36, section 111(b) of the URAA, and section 604 of the Trade Act, do hereby proclaim that:</p>

<p class="note-body">(2) The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Mongolia shall be effective as of the date of signature of this proclamation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) In order to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated under the auspices of the WTO to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates, and to make technical corrections in the tariff treatment accorded to such products, the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Such modifications to the HTS shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in the Annex for the respective actions taken.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</p>

In 1998, Albania concluded a bilateral investment treaty with the United States. Albania is in the process of acceding to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Georgia has also made considerable progress toward respecting fundamental human rights consistent with the objectives of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the &ldquo;Trade Act&rdquo;) (19 U.S.C. 2431, <em>et seq</em>.). Further, I have found Georgia to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements under the Trade Act.

<p class="note-body">2. On November 15, 1999, the United States and China agreed on certain terms and conditions for China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that when implemented will eliminate or greatly reduce the principal barriers to trade and investment in China.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. On November 9, 2001, pursuant to section 101(b) of Public Law 106&ndash;286, 114 Stat. 881 [set out as a note above], I transmitted a report to the Congress certifying that the terms and conditions for the accession of China to the WTO are at least equivalent to those agreed between the United States and China on November 15, 1999. On November 10, 2001, the Ministerial Conference of the WTO approved the terms and conditions for China's accession and invited China to become a member of the WTO. China has accepted these terms and conditions and became a WTO member on December 11, 2001.</p>

<p class="note-body">1. Since declaring its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia has made considerable progress in enacting market reforms and on February 5, 2003, Armenia acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The extension of unconditional normal trade relations treatment to the products of Armenia will permit the United States to avail itself of all rights under the WTO with respect to Armenia.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Investigation by International Trade Commission; report; publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon request of the President or the United States Trade Representative, upon resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the International Trade Commission (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) shall promptly make an investigation to determine, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, whether market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of subsections (a)(3), (b)(4),<sup><a href="#2436_1_target" name="2436_1">1</a></sup> and (c)(4) of section 2252 of this title shall apply with respect to investigations by the Commission under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall report to the President its determination with respect to each investigation under paragraph (1) and the basis therefor and shall include in each report any dissenting or separate views. If the Commission finds, as a result of its investigation, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, it shall find the amount of the increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such market disruption and shall include such finding in its report to the President. The Commission shall furnish to the President a transcript of the hearings and any briefs which may have been submitted in connection with each investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The report of the Commission of its determination with respect to an investigation under paragraph (1) shall be made at the earliest practicable time, but not later than 3 months after the date on which the petition is filed (or the date on which the request or resolution is received or the motion is adopted, as the case may be). Upon making such report to the President, the Commission shall also promptly make public such report (with the exception of information which the Commission determines to be confidential) and shall cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Affirmative determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any affirmative determination of the Commission under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such determination shall be treated as an affirmative determination made under section 2251(b) of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) sections 2252 and 2253 of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act of 1988), rather than the provisions of part 1 of subchapter II of this chapter as amended by section 1401 of such Act of 1988, shall apply with respect to the taking of subsequent action, if any, by the President in response to such affirmative determination;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the President may take action under such sections 2252 and 2253 of this title only with respect to imports from the country or countries involved of the article with respect to which the affirmative determination was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such action consists of, or includes, an orderly marketing agreement, such agreement shall be entered into within 60 days after the import relief determination date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Products of Communist countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time, the President finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall request the Commission to initiate an investigation under subsection (a) of this section. If the President further finds that emergency action is necessary, he may take action under sections 2252 and 2253 of this title referred to in subsection (b) of this section as if an affirmative determination of the Commission had been made under subsection (a) of this section. Any action taken by the President under the preceding sentence shall cease to apply (1) if a negative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the Commission's report of such determination is submitted to the President, or (2) if an affirmative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the action taken by the President pursuant to such determination becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petitions to initiate consultations as provided for by safeguard arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition may be filed with the President by an entity described in section 2251(a)(1) of this title requesting the President to initiate consultations provided for by the safeguard arrangements of any agreement entered into under section 2435 of this title with respect to imports of an article which is the product of the country which is the other party to such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the President determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of such article, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall initiate consultations with such country with respect to such imports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions; factors determining existence of market disruption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Communist country&rdquo; means any country dominated or controlled by communism.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:586 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Imports of an article shall be considered to be increasing rapidly if there has been a significant increase in such imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) during a recent period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The term &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission, in determining whether market disruption exists, shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the volume of imports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effect of imports of the merchandise on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of like or directly competitive articles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) evidence of disruptive pricing practices, or other efforts to unfairly manage trade patterns.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a product of the People's Republic of China is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of a like or directly competitive product, the President shall, in accordance with the provisions of this section, proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions with respect to such product, to the extent and for such period as the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the market disruption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of an investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon the request of the President or the United States Trade Representative (in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Trade Representative&rdquo;), upon resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, or the Committee on Finance of the Senate (in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Committees&rdquo;) or on its own motion, the United States International Trade Commission (in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether products of the People's Republic of China are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The limitations on investigations set forth in section 2252(h)(1) of this title shall apply to investigations conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of subsections (a)(8) and (i) of section 2252 of this title, relating to treatment of confidential business information, shall apply to investigations conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever a petition is filed, or a request or resolution is received, under this subsection, the Commission shall transmit a copy thereof to the President, the Trade Representative, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, except that in the case of confidential business information, the copy may include only nonconfidential summaries of such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to respond to the presentations of other parties, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:589 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Market disruption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, market disruption exists whenever imports of an article like or directly competitive with an article produced by a domestic industry are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat of material injury, to the domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Factors in determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether market disruption exists, the Commission shall consider objective factors, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the volume of imports of the product which is the subject of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the effect of imports of such product on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the effect of imports of such product on the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The presence or absence of any factor under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) is not necessarily dispositive of whether market disruption exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Time for Commission determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall make and transmit to the President and the Trade Representative its determination under subsection (b)(1) of this section at the earliest practicable time, but in no case later than 60 days (or 90 days in the case of a petition requesting relief under subsection (i) of this section) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, under subsection (b) of this section. If the Commissioners voting are equally divided with respect to its determination, then the determination agreed upon by either group of Commissioners may be considered by the President and the Trade Representative as the determination of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recommendations of Commission on proposed remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section, or a determination which the President or the Trade Representative may consider as affirmative under subsection (e) of this section, the Commission shall propose the amount of increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restrictions necessary to prevent or remedy the market disruption. Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section are eligible to vote on the proposed action to prevent or remedy market disruption. Members of the Commission who did not agree to the affirmative determination may submit, in the report required under subsection (g) of this section, separate views regarding what action, if any, should be taken to prevent or remedy market disruption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Report by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 20 days after a determination under subsection (b) of this section is made, the Commission shall submit a report to the President and the Trade Representative.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any dissenting or separate views by members of the Commission regarding the determination and any recommendation referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the short- and long-term effects that implementation of the action recommended under subsection (f) of this section is likely to have on the petitioning domestic industry, on other domestic industries, and on consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the short- and long-term effects of not taking the recommended action on the petitioning domestic industry, its workers, and the communities where production facilities of such industry are located, and on other domestic industries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission, after submitting a report to the President under paragraph (1), shall promptly make it available to the public (but shall not include confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Opportunity to present views and evidence on proposed measure and recommendation to the President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 20 days after receipt of the Commission's report under subsection (g) of this section (or 15 days in the case of an affirmative preliminary determination under subsection (i)(1)(B) of this section), the Trade Representative shall publish in the Federal Register notice of any measure proposed by the Trade Representative to be taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and of the opportunity, including a public hearing, if requested, for importers, exporters, and other interested parties to submit their views and evidence on the appropriateness of the proposed measure and whether it would be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 55 days after receipt of the report under subsection (g) of this section (or 35 days in the case of an affirmative preliminary determination under subsection (i)(1)(B) of this section), the Trade Representative, taking into account the views and evidence received under paragraph (1) on the measure proposed by the Trade Representative, shall make a recommendation to the President concerning what action, if any, to take to prevent or remedy the market disruption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Critical circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When a petition filed under subsection (b) of this section alleges that critical circum<!-- PDFPage:590 -->stances exist and requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to the product identified in the petition, the Commission shall, not later than 45 days after the petition containing the request is filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determine whether delay in taking action under this section would cause damage to the relevant domestic industry which would be difficult to repair; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the determination under subparagraph (A) is affirmative, make a preliminary determination of whether imports of the product which is the subject of the investigation have caused or threatened to cause market disruption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Commissioners voting are equally divided with respect to either of its determinations, then the determination agreed upon by either group of Commissioners may be considered by the President and the Trade Representative as the determination of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On the date on which the Commission completes its determinations under paragraph (1), the Commission shall transmit a report on the determinations to the President and the Trade Representative, including the reasons for its determinations. If the determinations under paragraph (1) are affirmative, or may be considered by the President or the Trade Representative as affirmative under paragraph (1), the Commission shall include in its report its recommendations on proposed provisional measures to be taken to prevent or remedy the market disruption. Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determinations under paragraph (1) are eligible to vote on the proposed provisional measures to prevent or remedy market disruption. Members of the Commission who did not agree to the affirmative determinations may submit, in the report, dissenting or separate views regarding the determination and any recommendation of provisional measures referred to in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the determinations under paragraph (1) are affirmative, or may be considered by the President or the Trade Representative as affirmative under paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall, within 10 days after receipt of the Commission's report, determine the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the market disruption and shall provide a recommendation to the President on what provisional measures, if any, to take.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The President shall determine whether to provide provisional relief and proclaim such relief, if any, within 10 days after receipt of the recommendation from the Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such relief may take the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the imposition of or increase in any duty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any modification, or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of an article into the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any combination of actions under clauses (i) and (ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any provisional action proclaimed by the President pursuant to a determination of critical circumstances shall remain in effect not more than 200 days.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Monitoring by Customs Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which a WTO member other than the United States requests consultations with the People's Republic of China under the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization, the Trade Representative shall inform the United States Customs Service, which shall monitor imports into the United States of those products of Chinese origin that are the subject of the consultation request. Data from such monitoring shall promptly be made available to the Commission upon request by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon the request of the President or the Trade Representative, upon resolution of either of the Committees, or on its own motion, the Commission shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether an action described in subsection (c) of this section has caused, or threatens to cause, a significant diversion of trade into the domestic market of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to respond to the presentations of other parties, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of subsections (a)(8) and (i) of section 2252 of this title, relating to treatment of confidential business information, shall apply to investigations conducted under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An action is described in this subsection if it is an action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by the People's Republic of China to prevent or remedy market disruption in a WTO member other than the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by a WTO member other than the United States to withdraw concessions under the WTO Agreement or otherwise to limit imports to prevent or remedy market disruption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by a WTO member other than the United States to apply a provisional safeguard within the meaning of the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any combination of actions described in paragraphs (1) through (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis for determination of significant diversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In determining whether significant diversion or the threat thereof exists for purposes of this section, the Commission shall take into account, to the extent such evidence is reasonably available&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the monitoring conducted under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the actual or imminent increase in United States market share held by such imports from the People's Republic of China;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the actual or imminent increase in volume of such imports into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the nature and extent of the action taken or proposed by the WTO member concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the extent of exports from the People's Republic of China to that WTO member and to the United States;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) cyclical or seasonal trends in import volumes into the United States of the products at issue; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) conditions of demand and supply in the United States market for the products at issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The presence or absence of any factor under any of subparagraphs (A) through (I) is not necessarily dispositive of whether a significant diversion of trade or the threat thereof exists.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If more than one action by a WTO member or WTO members against a particular product is identified in the petition, request, or resolution under subsection (b) of this section or during the investigation, the Commission may cumulatively assess the actual or likely effects of such actions jointly in determining whether a significant diversion of trade or threat thereof exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Commission determination; agreement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall make and transmit to the President and the Trade Representative its determination under subsection (b) of this section at the earliest practicable time, but in no case later than 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, under subsection (b) of this section. If the Commissioners voting are equally divided with respect to its determination, then the determination agreed upon by either group of Commissioners may be considered by the President and the Trade Representative as the determination of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Trade Representative is authorized to enter into agreements with the People's Republic of China or the other WTO members concerned to take such action as necessary to prevent or remedy significant trade diversion or threat thereof into the domestic market of the United States, and should seek to conclude such agreements before the expiration of the 60-day consultation period provided for under the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO, which shall commence not later than 5 days after the Trade Representative receives an affirmative determination provided for in paragraph (1) or a determination which the Trade Representative considers to be an affirmative determination pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Report by Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Not later than 10 days after a determination under subsection (b) of this section,<sup><a href="#2451a_1_target" name="2451a_1">1</a></sup> is made, the Commission shall transmit a report to the President and the Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Commission shall include in the report required under subparagraph (A) the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The determination made under subsection (b) of this section and an explanation of the basis for the determination.</p>

Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section are eligible to vote on the proposed action to prevent or remedy the trade diversion or threat thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Any dissenting or separate views by members of the Commission regarding the determination and any recommendation referred to in clauses (i) and (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) A description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the short- and long-term effects that implementation of the action recommended under clause (ii) is likely to have on the petitioning domestic industry, on other domestic industries, and on consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the short- and long-term effects of not taking the recommended action on the petitioning domestic industry, its workers and the communities where production facilities of such industry are located, and on other domestic industries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission, after submitting a report to the President under subparagraph (A), shall promptly make it available to the public (with the exception of confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If consultations fail to lead to an agreement with the People's Republic of China or the WTO member concerned within 60 days, the Trade Representative shall promptly publish notice in the Federal Register of any proposed action to prevent or remedy the trade diversion, and provide an opportunity for interested persons to present views and evidence on whether the proposed action is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Recommendation to the President</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Within 20 days after receipt of the recommendation from the Trade Representative, the President shall determine what action to take to prevent or remedy the trade diversion or threat thereof.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Review of circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall review the continued need for action taken under subsection (h) of this section if the WTO member or members involved notify the Committee on Safeguards of the WTO of any modification in the action taken by them against the People's Republic of China pursuant to consultation referred to in subsection (a) of this section. The Commission shall, not later than 60 days after such notification, determine whether a significant diversion of trade continues to exist and report its determination to the President. The President shall determine, within 15 days after receiving the Commission's report, whether to modify, withdraw, or keep in place the action taken under subsection (h) of this section.</p>
