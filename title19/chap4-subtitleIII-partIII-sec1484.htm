<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Admissibility of data electronically transmitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any entry or other information transmitted by means of an authorized electronic data interchange system shall be admissible in any and all administrative and judicial proceedings as evidence of such entry or information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of merchandise that is purchased and invoiced as a single entity but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is shipped in an unassembled or disassembled condition in separate shipments due to the size or nature of the merchandise, or</p>
