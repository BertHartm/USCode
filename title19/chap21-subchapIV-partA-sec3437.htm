<p class="statutory-body">Within 90 days after receipt of a petition under subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall decide whether to identify the industry on the basis that there is a reasonable likelihood that the industry may face both the subsidization described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and the deterioration described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action after identification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the request of an entity that is representative of an industry identified under subsection (b) of this section, the Trade Representative shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Initiation of action under other law</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce shall review information obtained under subsection (c) of this section and consult with the industry identified under subsection (b) of this section with a view to deciding whether any action is appropriate&mdash;</p>
