<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Government Procurement Procedures</em>. (a) Waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) With respect to eligible products (as defined in section 381(c) of the NAFTA Implementation Act [amending section 2518(4)(A) of this title]) of Canada and Mexico, and suppliers of such products, the application of any law, regulation, procedure, or practice regarding Federal Government procurement that would, if applied to such products or suppliers, result in treatment less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) to United States products and services and suppliers of such products and services; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) to eligible products of either Mexico or Canada, shall be waived.</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) The executive agencies listed in Annex 2 are directed to procure eligible products in compliance with the procedural provisions of Chapter 10 of the NAFTA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Trade Representative shall be responsible for calculating and adjusting the threshold as required by Article 1001(1)(c) of the NAFTA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) This order shall apply only to solicitations issued on or after the date of entry into force of the NAFTA for the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Although regulatory implementation of this order must await revisions to the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), it is expected that agencies listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of this order will take all appropriate actions in the interim to implement those aspects of the order that are not dependent upon regulatory revision.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:665 --><p class="note-body">(g) Pursuant to section 25 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 421(a)), the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall ensure that the policies established herein are incorporated in the FAR within 30 days from the date this order is issued.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Government Use of Patented Technology</em>. (a) Each agency shall, within 30 days from the date this order is issued, modify or adopt procedures to ensure compliance with Article 1709(10) of the NAFTA regarding notice when patented technology is used by or for the Federal Government without a license from the owner, except that the requirement of Article 1709(10)(b) regarding reasonable efforts to obtain advance authorization from the patent owner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) is hereby waived for an invention used or manufactured by or for the Federal Government, except that the patent owner must be notified whenever the agency or its contractor, without making a patent search, knows or has demonstrable reasonable grounds to know that an invention described in and covered by a valid United States patent is or will be used or manufactured without a license; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) is waived whenever a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency exists, except that the patent owner must be notified as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies shall treat the term &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; as used in Articles 1709(10)(h) and (j) and 1715 of the NAFTA as equivalent to &ldquo;reasonable and entire compensation&rdquo; as used in section 1498 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In addition to the general provisions of section 7 of this order regarding enforceable rights, nothing in this order is intended to suggest that the giving of notice to a patent owner under Article 1709(10) of the NAFTA constitutes an admission that the Federal Government has infringed a valid privately-owned patent.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Effective Date</em>. This order shall take effect upon the date of entry into force of the NAFTA for the United States.</p>
