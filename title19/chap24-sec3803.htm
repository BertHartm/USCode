<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the President determines that one or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries before&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) July 1, 2005; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) such additional duties,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The President shall notify the Congress of the President's intention to enter into an agreement under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No proclamation may be made under paragraph (1) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on August 6, 2002) to a rate of duty which is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies on August 6, 2002;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduces the rate of duty below that applicable under the Uruguay Round Agreements, on any import sensitive agricultural product; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Rounding</h4>
