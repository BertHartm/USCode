<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) applies to merchandise that is the product of a Subsidies Agreement country, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) is in effect on the date on which such country becomes a Subsidies Agreement country, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is issued on a date that is after the date described in clause (i) pursuant to a court order in an action brought under section 1516a of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Commission, upon receipt of a request from an interested party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title for an injury investigation with respect to such order, shall initiate an investigation and shall determine whether an industry in the United States is likely to be materially injured by reason of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Description of countervailing duty orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A countervailing duty order described in this paragraph is an order issued under section 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1675b_1_target" name="1675b_1">1</a></sup> of this title with respect to which the requirement of an affirmative determination of material injury under section 1303(a)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1675b_1_target" name="1675b_1">1</a></sup> of this title was not applicable at the time such order was issued.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requirements of request for investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A request for an investigation under this subsection shall be submitted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an order described in paragraph (1)(B)(i), within 6 months after the date on which the country described in paragraph (1)(A) becomes a Subsidies Agreement country, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of requests for investigations received under this section within 1 year after the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, the Commission may, after consulting with the administering authority, initiate its investigations in a manner that results in determinations being made in all such investigations during the 4-year period beginning on such date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net countervailable subsidy; nature of subsidy</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Net countervailable subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable <!-- PDFPage:302 -->subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order which is the subject of the investigation is revoked. The administering authority normally shall choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under section 1671d of this title or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title. If the Commission considers the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy in making its determination under this section, the Commission shall use the net countervailable subsidy provided by the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nature of subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority shall inform the Commission of, and the Commission, in making its determination under this section, shall consider, the nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or Article 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Negative determination</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Upon being notified by the Commission that it has made a negative determination under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the administering authority shall revoke the countervailing duty order, and shall refund, with interest, any estimated countervailing duties collected during the period liquidation was suspended pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation on negative determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A determination by the Commission that revocation of the order is not likely to result in material injury to an industry by reason of imports of the subject merchandise shall not be based, in whole or in part, on any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of the subject merchandise to the United States that were specifically intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Countervailing duty orders with respect to which no request for injury investigation is made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, with respect to a countervailing duty order described in subsection (a) of this section, a request for an investigation is not made within the time required by subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Commission shall notify the administering authority that a negative determination has been made under subsection (a) of this section and the provisions of paragraph (3)(B) shall apply with respect to the order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Pending and suspended countervailing duty investigations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, on the date on which a country becomes a Subsidies Agreement country, there is a countervailing duty investigation in progress or suspended under section 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1675b_2_target" name="1675b_2">2</a></sup> of this title that applies to merchandise which is a product of that country and with respect to which the requirement of an affirmative determination of material injury under section 1303(a)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1675b_2_target" name="1675b_2">2</a></sup> of this title was not applicable at the time the investigation was initiated, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requests for reviews</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding section 1675(c)(6)(A) of this title and except as provided in subparagraph (B), an interested party may request a review of an order under section 1675(c) of this title at the same time the party requests an investigation under subsection (a) of this section, if the order involves the same or comparable subject merchandise. Upon receipt of such request, the administering authority, after consulting with the <!-- PDFPage:303 -->Commission, shall initiate a review of the order under section 1675(c) of this title. The Commission shall combine such review with the investigation under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the administering authority determines that the interested party who requested an investigation under this section is a related party or an importer within the meaning of section 1677(4)(B) of this title, the administering authority may decline a request by such party to initiate a review of an order under section 1675(c) of this title which involves the same or comparable subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cumulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a review under section 1675(c) of this title is initiated under paragraph (1), such review shall be treated as having been initiated on the same day as the investigation under this section, and the Commission may, in accordance with section 1677(7)(G) of this title, cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which such investigations are treated as initiated on the same day.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time and procedure for Commission determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall render its determination in the investigation conducted under this section at the same time as the Commission's determination is made in the review under section 1675(c) of this title that is initiated pursuant to this subsection. The Commission shall in all other respects apply the procedures and standards set forth in section 1675(c) of this title to such section 1675(c) of this title reviews.</p>
