<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Trade in basic telecommunications services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The principal negotiating objective of the United States in the extended negotiations on basic telecommunications services to be conducted under the auspices of the WTO is to obtain the opening on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions of foreign markets for basic telecommunications services through facilities-based competition or through the resale of services on existing networks.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to maintain the scope and coverage on indirect support as specified in the US&ndash;EC bilateral agreement on large civil aircraft, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to obtain increased transparency with respect to foreign subsidy programs in the civil aircraft sector, both through greater government disclosure with respect to the use of taxpayer moneys and higher financial disclosure standards for companies receiving government supports (including disclosure comparable to that required under United States securities laws).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
