<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subparagraph in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold a public hearing at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, and to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The Commission shall transmit to the President a report on its investigation and determination under this subparagraph not later than 60 days before the action under subsection (a) is to terminate, unless the President specifies a different date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rate after termination of import relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When import relief under this section is terminated with respect to an article&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the rate of duty on that article after such termination and on or before December 31 of the year in which such termination occurs shall be the rate that, according to the Schedule of the United States to Annex 3.3 of the Agreement would have been in effect 1 year after the provision of relief under subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of duty for that article after December 31 of the year in which termination occurs shall be, at the discretion of the President, either&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a positive determination is made under section 4081(b) of this title, the President shall determine whether, as a result of the elimination of a duty under the Agreement, a CAFTA&ndash;DR textile or apparel article of a specified CAFTA&ndash;DR country is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that article, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing an article that is like, or directly competitive with, the imported article.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nature of relief</h4>
