<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Trade Representative shall take action authorized in subsection (c) of this section, subject to the specific direction, if any, of the President regarding any such action, and shall take all other appropriate and feasible action within the power of the President that the President may direct the Trade Representative to take under this subsection, to enforce such rights or to obtain the elimination of such act, policy, or practice. Actions may be taken that are within the power of the President with respect to trade in any goods or services, or with respect to any other area of pertinent relations with the foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Trade Representative is not required to take action under paragraph (1) in any case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Dispute Settlement Body (as defined in section 3531(5) of this title) has adopted a report, or a ruling issued under the formal dispute settlement proceeding provided under any other trade agreement finds, that&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Trade Representative finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) meet the requirements of paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing any service sector access authorization, and in addition to the authority conferred in paragraph (1), the Trade Representative may, for purposes of carrying out the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) deny the issuance of any such authorization.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Actions described in subparagraph (A) may only be taken under this section with respect to service sector access authorizations granted, or applications therefor pending, on or after the date on which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a determination to initiate an investigation is made by the Trade Representative under section 2412(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Before the Trade Representative takes any action under this section involving the imposition of fees or other restrictions on the services of a foreign country, the Trade Representative shall, if the services involved are subject to regulation by any agency of the Federal Government or of any State, consult, as appropriate, with the head of the agency concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The actions the Trade Representative is authorized to take under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be taken against any goods or economic sector&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on a nondiscriminatory basis or solely against the foreign country described in such subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without regard to whether or not such goods or economic sector were involved in the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of such action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any trade agreement described in paragraph (1)(D)(iii) shall provide compensatory trade benefits that benefit the economic sector which includes the domestic industry that would benefit from the elimination of the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of the action to be taken under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or benefit the economic sector as closely related as possible to such economic sector, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the provision of such trade benefits is not feasible, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) trade benefits that benefit any other economic sector would be more satisfactory than such trade benefits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Trade Representative determines that actions to be taken under subsection (a) or (b) of this section are to be in the form of import restrictions, the Trade Representative shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give preference to the imposition of duties over the imposition of other import restrictions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if an import restriction other than a duty is imposed, consider substituting, on an incremental basis, an equivalent duty for such other import restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any action taken by the Trade Representative under this section with respect to export targeting shall, to the extent possible, reflect the full benefit level of the export targeting to the beneficiary over the period during which the action taken has an effect.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Part II: Identification of Discriminatory Government Procurement Practices</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Identification and Annual Report</em>. (a) Within 30 days of the submission of the National Trade Estimate Report for 1999, 2000, and 2001, the Trade Representative shall submit to the Committees on Finance and on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committees on Ways and Means and Government Reform and Oversight of the House of Representatives, and shall publish in the Federal Register, a report on the extent to which foreign countries discriminate against U.S. products or services in making government procurements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In the report, the Trade Representative shall identify countries that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) are not in compliance with their obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (the GPA), Chapter 10 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or other agreements relating to government procurement (procurement agreements) to which that country and the United States are parties; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) maintain, in government procurement, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. products or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses and whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Considerations in Making Identifications</em>. In making the identifications required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall: (a) consider the requirements of the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, government procurement practices, and the effects of such practices on U.S. businesses as a basis for evaluating whether the procurement practices of foreign governments do not provide fair market opportunities for U.S. products or services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) take into account, among other factors, whether and to what extent countries that are parties to the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, and other countries described in section 1 of this part:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures for procurement that could have been conducted using competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) conduct what normally would have been one procurement as two or more procurements, to decrease the anticipated contract values below the value threshold of the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, or to make the procurement less attractive to U.S. businesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) announce procurement opportunities with inadequate time intervals for U.S. businesses to submit bids; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) use specifications in such a way as to limit the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) consider information included in the National Trade Estimate Report, and any other additional criteria deemed appropriate, including, to the extent such information is available, the failure to apply transparent and competitive procedures or maintain and enforce effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with government procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Impact of Noncompliance and Denial of Comparable Treatment</em>. The Trade Representative shall take <!-- PDFPage:524 -->into account, in identifying countries in the annual report and in any action required by this part, the relative impact of any noncompliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, or of other discrimination on U.S. commerce, and the extent to which such noncompliance or discrimination has impeded the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements on terms comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question when seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Resolution</em>. Upon submission of the report required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall engage any country identified therein for the purpose of seeking a satisfactory resolution, for example, by obtaining compliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements or the elimination of the discriminatory procurement practices as quickly as possible, or, if this is not feasible, by providing for compensatory trade benefits.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Initiation of Investigations</em>. (a) Within 90 days of the submission of the report required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall initiate under section 302(b)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(1)) investigations with respect to any practice that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) was the basis for the identification of a country under section 1; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) is not at that time the subject of any other investigation or action under title III, chapter 1, of the Act [19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.],</p>
<p class="note-body-block">unless during the 90-day period the Trade Representative determines that a satisfactory resolution of the matter to be investigated has been achieved.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) For investigations initiated under paragraph (a) of this section (other than an investigation involving the GPA or NAFTA), the Trade Representative shall apply the time limits and procedures in section 304(a)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)). The time limits in subsection 304(a)(3)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)(B)) shall apply if the Trade Representative determines that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) complex or complicated issues are involved in the investigation that require additional time;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) the foreign country involved in the investigation is making substantial progress in drafting or implementing legislative or administrative measures that will end the discriminatory procurement practice; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) such foreign country is undertaking enforcement measures to end the discriminatory procurement practice.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Part III: Direction</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Presidential Direction</em>. The authorities delegated pursuant to this order shall be exercised subject to any subsequent direction by the President in a particular matter.</p>
