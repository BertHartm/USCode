<h4 class="note-head">Part II: Identification of Discriminatory Government Procurement Practices</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Identification and Annual Report</em>. (a) Within 30 days of the submission of the National Trade Estimate Report for 1999, 2000, and 2001, the Trade Representative shall submit to the Committees on Finance and on Governmental Affairs [now Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs] of the Senate and the Committees on Ways and Means and Government Reform and Oversight [now Committee on Oversight and Government Reform] of the House of Representatives, and shall publish in the Federal Register, a report on the extent to which foreign countries discriminate against U.S. products or services in making government procurements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In the report, the Trade Representative shall identify countries that:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:615 --><p class="note-body-1em">(1) are not in compliance with their obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (the GPA), Chapter 10 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or other agreements relating to government procurement (procurement agreements) to which that country and the United States are parties; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) maintain, in government procurement, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. products or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses and whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Considerations in Making Identifications</em>. In making the identifications required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall: (a) consider the requirements of the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, government procurement practices, and the effects of such practices on U.S. businesses as a basis for evaluating whether the procurement practices of foreign governments do not provide fair market opportunities for U.S. products or services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) take into account, among other factors, whether and to what extent countries that are parties to the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, and other countries described in section 1 of this part:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures for procurement that could have been conducted using competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) conduct what normally would have been one procurement as two or more procurements, to decrease the anticipated contract values below the value threshold of the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, or to make the procurement less attractive to U.S. businesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) announce procurement opportunities with inadequate time intervals for U.S. businesses to submit bids; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) use specifications in such a way as to limit the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) consider information included in the National Trade Estimate Report, and any other additional criteria deemed appropriate, including, to the extent such information is available, the failure to apply transparent and competitive procedures or maintain and enforce effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with government procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Impact of Noncompliance and Denial of Comparable Treatment</em>. The Trade Representative shall take into account, in identifying countries in the annual report and in any action required by this part, the relative impact of any noncompliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, or of other discrimination on U.S. commerce, and the extent to which such noncompliance or discrimination has impeded the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements on terms comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question when seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Resolution</em>. Upon submission of the report required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall engage any country identified therein for the purpose of seeking a satisfactory resolution, for example, by obtaining compliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements or the elimination of the discriminatory procurement practices as quickly as possible, or, if this is not feasible, by providing for compensatory trade benefits.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Initiation of Investigations</em>. (a) Within 90 days of the submission of the report required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall initiate under section 302(b)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(1)) investigations with respect to any practice that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) was the basis for the identification of a country under section 1; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) is not at that time the subject of any other investigation or action under title III, chapter 1, of the Act [19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.],</p>
<p class="note-body-block">unless during the 90-day period the Trade Representative determines that a satisfactory resolution of the matter to be investigated has been achieved.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) For investigations initiated under paragraph (a) of this section (other than an investigation involving the GPA or NAFTA), the Trade Representative shall apply the time limits and procedures in section 304(a)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)). The time limits in subsection 304(a)(3)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)(B)) shall apply if the Trade Representative determines that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) complex or complicated issues are involved in the investigation that require additional time;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) the foreign country involved in the investigation is making substantial progress in drafting or implementing legislative or administrative measures that will end the discriminatory procurement practice; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) such foreign country is undertaking enforcement measures to end the discriminatory procurement practice.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Part III: Direction</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Presidential Direction</em>. The authorities delegated pursuant to this order shall be exercised subject to any subsequent direction by the President in a particular matter.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Consultations and Advice</em>. In developing the annual reports required by part I and part II of this order, the Trade Representative shall consult with executive agencies and seek information and advice from U.S. businesses in the United States and in the countries involved in the practices under consideration.</p>
