<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person, by fraud, or negligence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may seek, induce or affect, or attempt to seek, induce, or affect, the payment or credit to that person or others of any drawback claim by means of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any document, written or oral statement, or electronically transmitted data or information, or act which is material and false, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any omission which is material; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may aid or abet any other person to violate subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Clerical errors or mistakes of fact are not violations of paragraph (1) unless they are part of a pattern of negligent conduct. The mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prepenalty notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a) of this section and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue to the person concerned a written notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) identify the drawback claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) set forth the details relating to the seeking, inducing, or affecting, or the attempted seeking, inducing, or affecting, or the aiding or procuring of, the drawback claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) specify all laws and regulations allegedly violated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) disclose all the material facts which establish the alleged violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) state whether the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud or negligence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) state the estimated actual or potential loss of revenue due to the drawback claim, and, taking into account all circumstances, the amount of the proposed monetary penalty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) inform such person that he shall have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why a claim for a monetary penalty should not be issued in the amount stated.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:229 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Customs Service may not issue a prepenalty notice if the amount of the penalty in the penalty claim issued under paragraph (2) is $1,000 or less. In such cases, the Customs Service may proceed directly with a penalty claim.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No prepenalty notice in which the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud shall be issued without the prior approval of Customs Headquarters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalty claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a) of this section, as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the Customs Service shall promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, Customs shall issue a written penalty claim to such person. The written penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under clauses (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1)(A). Such person shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under section 1618 of this title, the Customs Service shall provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A fraudulent violation of subsection (a) of this section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Negligence</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A negligent violation of subsection (a) of this section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the 1st violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repetitive violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service determines that a repeat negligent violation occurs relating to the same issue, the penalty amount for the 2d violation shall be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the total actual or potential loss of revenue. The penalty amount for each succeeding repetitive negligent violation shall be in an amount not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue. If the same party commits a nonrepetitive violation, that violation shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prior disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of subsection (a) of this section before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the violation resulted from fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest applied under section 6621 of title 26 on the amount of actual revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived during the period that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) begins on the date of the overpayment of the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) ends on the date on which the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Condition affecting penalty limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitations in subparagraph (A) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed under this subsection apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on the claim at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such longer period as the Customs Service may provide), after notice by the Customs Service of its calculation of the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Commencement of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) of this section existed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exclusivity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Penalty claims under this section shall be the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback related violation of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deprivation of lawful revenue</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A party may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program after meeting the general requirements established under the program or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the party and the Customs Service.
