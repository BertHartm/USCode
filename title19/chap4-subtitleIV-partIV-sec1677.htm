<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;administering authority&rdquo; means the Secretary of Commerce, or any other officer of the United States to whom the responsibility for carrying out the duties of the administering authority under this subtitle are transferred by law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; means the United States International Trade Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;country&rdquo; means a foreign country, a political subdivision, dependent territory, or possession of a foreign country, and, except for the purpose of antidumping proceedings, may include an association of 2 or more foreign countries, political subdivisions, dependent territories, or possessions of countries into a customs union outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Industry</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;industry&rdquo; means the producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Related parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If a producer of a domestic like product and an exporter or importer of the subject merchandise are related parties, or if a producer of the domestic like product is also an importer of the subject merchandise, the producer may, in appropriate circumstances, be excluded from the industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), a producer and an exporter or importer shall be considered to be related parties, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the producer directly or indirectly controls the exporter or importer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the exporter or importer directly or indirectly controls the producer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a third party directly or indirectly controls the producer and the exporter or importer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) the producer and the exporter or importer directly or indirectly control a <!-- PDFPage:335 -->third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the producer to act differently than a nonrelated producer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, a party shall be considered to directly or indirectly control another party if the party is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Regional industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In appropriate circumstances, the United States, for a particular product market, may be divided into 2 or more markets and the producers within each market may be treated as if they were a separate industry if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the producers within such market sell all or almost all of their production of the domestic like product in question in that market, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the demand in that market is not supplied, to any substantial degree, by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In such appropriate circumstances, material injury, the threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry may be found to exist with respect to an industry even if the domestic industry as a whole, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of that product, is not injured, if there is a concentration of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy into such an isolated market and if the producers of all, or almost all, of the production within that market are being materially injured or threatened by material injury, or if the establishment of an industry is being materially retarded, by reason of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy. The term &ldquo;regional industry&rdquo; means the domestic producers within a region who are treated as a separate industry under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Product lines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The effect of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed in relation to the United States production of a domestic like product if available data permit the separate identification of production in terms of such criteria as the production process or the producer's profits. If the domestic production of the domestic like product has no separate identity in terms of such criteria, then the effect of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes a domestic like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Industry producing processed agricultural products</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (v), in an investigation involving a processed agricultural product produced from any raw agricultural product, the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product may be considered part of the industry producing the processed product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the processed agricultural product is produced from the raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) there is a substantial coincidence of economic interest between the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product and the processors of the processed agricultural product based upon relevant economic factors, which may, in the discretion of the Commission, include price, added market value, or other economic interrelationships (regardless of whether such coincidence of economic interest is based upon any legal relationship).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the processed agricultural product shall be considered to be processed from a raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the raw agricultural product is substantially or completely devoted to the production of the processed agricultural product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the processed agricultural product is produced substantially or completely from the raw product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Relevant economic factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i)(II), in addition to such other factors it considers relevant to the question of coincidence of economic interest, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if price is taken into account, consider the degree of correlation between the price of the raw agricultural product and the price of the processed agricultural product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if added market value is taken into account, consider whether the value of the raw agricultural product constitutes a significant percentage of the value of the processed agricultural product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Raw agricultural product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;raw agricultural product&rdquo; means any farm or fishery product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Termination of this subparagraph</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:336 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Countervailable subsidy</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (5B), a countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in this paragraph which is specific as described in paragraph (5A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subsidy described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A subsidy is described in this paragraph in the case in which an authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provides a financial contribution,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides any form of income or price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) makes a payment to a funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution, or entrusts or directs a private entity to make a financial contribution, if providing the contribution would normally be vested in the government and the practice does not differ in substance from practices normally followed by governments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">to a person and a benefit is thereby conferred. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (5A) and (5B), the term &ldquo;authority&rdquo; means a government of a country or any public entity within the territory of the country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination of whether a subsidy exists shall be made without regard to whether the recipient of the subsidy is publicly or privately owned and without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly or indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of merchandise. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining whether a subsidy exists under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Financial contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;financial contribution&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the direct transfer of funds, such as grants, loans, and equity infusions, or the potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities, such as loan guarantees,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) foregoing or not collecting revenue that is otherwise due, such as granting tax credits or deductions from taxable income,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) providing goods or services, other than general infrastructure, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) purchasing goods.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Benefit conferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A benefit shall normally be treated as conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a loan, if there is a difference between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on the market,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of a loan guarantee, if there is a difference, after adjusting for any difference in guarantee fees, between the amount the recipient of the guarantee pays on the guaranteed loan and the amount the recipient would pay for a comparable commercial loan if there were no guarantee by the authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in the case where goods or services are provided, if such goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration, and in the case where goods are purchased, if such goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Change in ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable, even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm's length transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5A) Specificity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A subsidy is specific if it is an export subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or an import substitution subsidy described in subparagraph (C), or if it is determined to be specific pursuant to subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Export subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An export subsidy is a subsidy that is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Import substitution subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An import substitution subsidy is a subsidy that is contingent upon the use of domestic goods over imported goods, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Domestic subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether a subsidy (other than a subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or (C)) is a specific subsidy, in law or in fact, to an enterprise or industry within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the following guidelines shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, expressly limits access to the subsidy to an enterprise or industry, the subsidy is specific as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to <!-- PDFPage:337 -->which the authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, the subsidy is not specific as a matter of law, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) eligibility is automatic,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the criteria or conditions for eligibility are strictly followed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the criteria or conditions are clearly set forth in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The actual recipients of the subsidy, whether considered on an enterprise or industry basis, are limited in number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) An enterprise or industry is a predominant user of the subsidy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) An enterprise or industry receives a disproportionately large amount of the subsidy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) The manner in which the authority providing the subsidy has exercised discretion in the decision to grant the subsidy indicates that an enterprise or industry is favored over others.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In evaluating the factors set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), and (IV), the administering authority shall take into account the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, and the length of time during which the subsidy program has been in operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Where a subsidy is limited to an enterprise or industry located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the subsidy is specific.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (5B), any reference to an enterprise or industry is a reference to a foreign enterprise or foreign industry and includes a group of such enterprises or industries.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5B) Categories of noncountervailable subsidies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (5A), in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, a subsidy shall be treated as noncountervailable if the administering authority determines in an investigation under part I of this subtitle or a review under part III of this subtitle that the subsidy meets all of the criteria described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), as the case may be, or the provisions of subparagraph (E)(i) apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Research subsidy</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except for a subsidy provided on the manufacture, production, or export of civil aircraft, a subsidy for research activities conducted by a person, or by a higher education or research establishment on a contract basis with a person, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy covers not more than 75 percent of the costs of industrial research or not more than 50 percent of the costs of precompetitive development activity, and such subsidy is limited exclusively to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the costs of researchers, technicians, and other supporting staff employed exclusively in the research activity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs of instruments, equipment, land, or buildings that are used exclusively and permanently (except when disposed of on a commercial basis) for the research activity,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;precompetitive development activity&rdquo; means the translation of industrial research findings into a plan, blueprint, or design for new, modified, or improved products, processes, or services, whether intended for sale or use, including the creation of a first prototype that would not be capable of commercial use. The term also may include the conceptual formulation and design of products, processes, or services alternatives and initial demonstration or pilot projects, if these same projects cannot be converted or used for industrial application or commercial exploitation. The term does not include routine or periodic alterations to existing products, production lines, manufacturing processes, services, or other ongoing operations even if those alterations may represent improvements.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:338 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Calculation rules</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of a research activity that spans both industrial research and precompetitive development activity, the allowable level of the noncountervailable subsidy shall not exceed 62.5 percent of the costs set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), and (V) of clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Total eligible costs</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy provided, pursuant to a general framework of regional development, to a person located in a disadvantaged region within a country shall be treated as noncountervailable, if it is not specific (within the meaning of paragraph (5A)) within eligible regions and if the following conditions are met:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Each region is considered a disadvantaged region on the basis of neutral and objective criteria indicating that the region is disadvantaged because of more than temporary circumstances, and such criteria are clearly stated in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) The criteria described in subclause (II) include a measurement of economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) Programs provided within a general framework of regional development include ceilings on the amount of assistance that can be granted to a subsidized project. Such ceilings are differentiated according to the different levels of development of assisted regions, and are expressed in terms of investment costs or costs of job creation. Within such ceilings, the distribution of assistance is sufficiently broad and even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or the provision of disproportionately large amounts of a subsidy to, an enterprise or industry as described in paragraph (5A)(D).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Measurement of economic development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the measurement of economic development shall be based on one or more of the following factors:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;general framework of regional development&rdquo; means that the regional subsidy programs are part of an internally consistent and generally applicable regional development policy, and that regional development subsidies are not granted in isolated geographical points having no, or virtually no, influence on the development of a region.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Neutral and objective criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;neutral and objective criteria&rdquo; means criteria that do not favor certain regions beyond what is appropriate for the elimination or reduction of regional disparities within the framework of the regional development policy.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Subsidy for adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy that is provided to promote the adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements that are imposed by statute or by regulation, and that result in greater constraints and financial burdens on the recipient of the subsidy, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is a one-time nonrecurring measure,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is limited to 20 percent of the cost of adaptation,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall consider the factors set forth in clause (i) as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this subtitle. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under clause (i) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
