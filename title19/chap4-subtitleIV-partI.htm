<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then there shall be imposed upon such merchandise a countervailing duty, in addition to any other duty imposed, equal to the amount of the net countervailable subsidy. For purposes of this subsection and section 1671d(b)(1) of this title, a reference to the sale of merchandise includes the entering into of any leasing arrangement regarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of the merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subsidies Agreement country</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) requires unconditional most-favored-nation treatment with respect to articles imported into the United States, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:284 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the agreement described in subparagraph (A) does not expressly permit&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) nondiscriminatory prohibitions or restrictions on importation which are designed to prevent deceptive or unfair practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Countervailing duty investigations involving imports not entitled to a material injury determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any article or merchandise imported from a country which is not a Subsidies Agreement country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no determination by the Commission under section 1671b(a), 1671c, or 1671d(b) of this title shall be required,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of international consortia</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, if the members (or other participating entities) of an international consortium that is engaged in the production of subject merchandise receive countervailable subsidies from their respective home countries to assist, permit, or otherwise enable their participation in that consortium through production or manufacturing operations in their respective home countries, then the administering authority shall cumulate all such countervailable subsidies, as well as countervailable subsidies provided directly to the international consortium, in determining any countervailing duty upon such merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Upstream subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy, as defined in section 1677&ndash;1(a)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1671_1_target" name="1671_1">1</a></sup> of this title, is being paid or bestowed, the administering authority shall investigate whether an upstream subsidy has in fact been paid or bestowed, and if so, shall include the amount of the upstream subsidy as provided in section 1677&ndash;1(a)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1671_2_target" name="1671_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initiation by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A countervailing duty investigation shall be initiated whenever the administering authority determines, from information available to it, that a formal investigation is warranted into the question of whether the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1671(a) of this title exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation by petition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petition requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A countervailing duty proceeding shall be initiated whenever an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title files a petition with the administering authority, on behalf of an industry, which alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of the duty imposed by section 1671(a) of this title, and which is accompanied by information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting those allegations. The petition may be amended at such time, and upon such conditions, as the administering authority and the Commission may permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Simultaneous filing with Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petitioner shall file a copy of the petition with the Commission on the same day as it is filed with the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Petition based upon a derogation of an international undertaking on official export credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sole basis of a petition filed under paragraph (1) is the derogation of an international undertaking on official export credits, the Administering Authority shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Treasury who shall, in consultation with the Administering Authority, within 5 days after the <!-- PDFPage:288 -->date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under subsection (c) of this section, determine the existence and estimated value of the derogation, if any, and shall publish such determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action with respect to petitions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notification of governments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide the government of any exporting country named in the petition that is a Subsidies Agreement country an opportunity for consultations with respect to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Acceptance of communications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority shall not accept any unsolicited oral or written communication from any person other than an interested party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title before the administering authority makes its decision whether to initiate an investigation, except as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii) and subsection (c)(4)(D) of this section, and except for inquiries regarding the status of the administering authority's consideration of the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Nondisclosure of certain information</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Time for initial determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), within 20 days after the date on which a petition is filed under subsection (b) of this section, the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after examining, on the basis of sources readily available to the administering authority, the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the petition, determine whether the petition alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1671(a) of this title and contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine if the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extension of time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the administering authority is required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the industry under paragraph (4)(D), the administering authority may, in exceptional circumstances, apply subparagraph (A) by substituting &ldquo;a maximum of 40 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;20 days&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Time limits where petition involves same merchandise as an order that has been revoked</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a petition is filed under this section with respect to merchandise that was the subject merchandise of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a countervailing duty order that was revoked under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a suspended investigation that was terminated under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination of industry support</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority shall determine that the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support for or opposition to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain positions disregarded</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Producers related to foreign producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining industry support under subparagraph (A), the administering authority shall disregard the position of domestic producers who oppose the petition, if such producers are related to foreign producers, as defined in section 1677(4)(B)(ii) of this title, unless such domestic producers demonstrate that their interests as domestic producers would be adversely affected by the imposition of a countervailing duty order.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Producers who are importers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The administering authority may disregard the position of domestic producers of a domestic like product who are importers of the subject merchandise.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:289 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for regional industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition alleges that the industry is a regional industry, the administering authority shall determine whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry by applying subparagraph (A) on the basis of production in the region.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Polling the industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition does not establish support of domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if there is support for the petition as required by subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if there is a large number of producers in the industry, the administering authority may determine industry support for the petition by using any statistically valid sampling method to poll the industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Comments by interested parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, any person who would qualify as an interested party under section 1677(9) of this title if an investigation were initiated, may submit comments or information on the issue of industry support. After the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, the determination regarding industry support shall not be reconsidered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Domestic producers or workers&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;domestic producers or workers&rdquo; means those interested parties who are eligible to file a petition under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notification to Commission of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notify the Commission immediately of any determination it makes under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the determination is affirmative, make available to the Commission such information as it may have relating to the matter under investigation, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Information regarding critical circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time after the initiation of an investigation under this part, the administering authority finds a reasonable basis to suspect that the alleged countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, the administering authority may request the Commissioner of Customs to compile information on an expedited basis regarding entries of the subject merchandise. Upon receiving such request, the Commissioner of Customs shall collect information regarding the volume and value of entries of the subject merchandise and shall transmit such information to the administering authority at such times as the administering authority shall direct (at least once every 30 days), until a final determination is made under section 1671d(a) of this title, the investigation is terminated, or the administering authority withdraws the request.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination by Commission of reasonable indication of injury</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of a petition dismissed by the administering authority under section 1671a(c)(3) of this title, the Commission, within the time specified in paragraph (2), shall determine, based on the information available to it at the time of the determination, whether there is a reasonable indication that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible. If the Commission finds that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible or otherwise makes a negative determination under this paragraph, the investigation shall be terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time for Commission determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make the determination described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a petition filed under section 1671a(b) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) within 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the time has been extended pursuant to section 1671a(c)(1)(B) of this title, within 25 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority of initiation of the investigation, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an investigation initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, within 45 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority that an investigation has been initiated under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preliminary determination by administering authority; expedited determinations; waiver of verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, but not before an affirmative determination by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the administering authority shall make a determination, based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the petition is one subject to section 1671a(b)(3) of this title, the Administering Authority shall, taking into account the nature of the countervailable subsidy concerned, make the determination required by paragraph (1) on an expedited basis and within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title unless the provisions of subsection (c) of this section apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 55 days after the initiation of an investigation the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 50 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title. Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made on an expedited basis on the basis of the record established <!-- PDFPage:291 -->during the first 50 days after the investigation was initiated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>De minimis countervailable subsidy.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any de minimis countervailable subsidy. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a countervailable subsidy is de minimis if the administering authority determines that the aggregate of the net countervailable subsidies is less than 1 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exception for developing countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of subject merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country (other than a country to which subparagraph (C) applies) designated by the Trade Representative as a developing country in accordance with section 1677(36) of this title, a countervailable subsidy is de minimis if the administering authority determines that the aggregate of the net countervailable subsidies does not exceed 2 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain other developing countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of subject merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a least developed country, as determined by the Trade Representative in accordance with section 1677(36) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a developing country with respect to which the Trade Representative has notified the administering authority that the country has eliminated its export subsidies on an expedited basis within the meaning of Article 27.11 of the Subsidies Agreement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;2 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on application of subparagraph</cap-smallcap> (C).&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a country described in subparagraph (C)(i), the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall not apply after the date that is 8 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for subparagraph</cap-smallcap> (C)(ii) <cap-smallcap>countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a country described in subparagraph (C)(ii), the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall not apply after the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the date that is 8 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the date on which the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that such country is providing an export subsidy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Notification of article 8 violation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the only subsidy under investigation is a subsidy with respect to which the administering authority received notice from the Trade Representative of a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;60 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;65 days&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of period in extraordinarily complicated cases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the petitioner makes a timely request for an extension of the period within which the determination must be made under subsection (b) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administering authority concludes that the parties concerned are cooperating and determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the number and complexity of the alleged countervailable subsidy practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the novelty of the issues presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the need to determine the extent to which particular countervailable subsidies are used by individual manufacturers, producers, and exporters; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the administering authority may postpone making the preliminary determination under subsection (b) of this section until not later than the 130th day after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of postponement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall notify the parties to the investigation, not later than 20 days before the date on which the preliminary determination would otherwise be required under subsection (b) of this section, if it intends to postpone making the preliminary determination under paragraph (1). The notification shall include an explanation of the reasons for the postponement. Notice of the postponement shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of determination by the administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the preliminary determination of the administering authority under subsection (b) of this section is affirmative, the administering authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) determine an estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate for each exporter and producer individually investigated, and, in accordance with section 1671d(c)(5) of this title, an estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated and for new exporters and producers within the meaning of section 1675(a)(2)(B) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if section 1677f&ndash;1(e)(2)(B) of this title applies, determine a single estimated country-wide subsidy rate, applicable to all exporters and producers, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate, the estimated all-others rate, or the estimated country-wide subsidy rate, whichever is applicable,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of merchandise subject to the de<!-- PDFPage:292 -->termination which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall make available to the Commission all information upon which its determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its injury determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The instructions of the administering authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) may not remain in effect for more than 4 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Critical circumstances determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a petitioner alleges critical circumstances in its original petition, or by amendment at any time more than 20 days before the date of a final determination by the administering authority, then the administering authority shall promptly (at any time after the initiation of the investigation under this part) determine, on the basis of the information available to it at that time, whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the alleged countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension of liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority under paragraph (1) is affirmative, then any suspension of liquidation ordered under subsection (d)(2) of this section shall apply, or, if notice of such suspension of liquidation is already published, be amended to apply, to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of&mdash;</p>

The administering authority shall include with such notification the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based. Not later than 5 days after the date on which the determination is required to be made under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Commission shall transmit to the administering authority the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Time period where upstream subsidization is involved</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the administering authority concludes prior to a preliminary determination under subsection (b) of this section, that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy is being bestowed, the time period within which a preliminary determination must be made shall be extended to 250 days after the filing of a petition under section 1671a(b) of this title or initiation of an investigation under section 1671a(a) of this title (310 days in cases declared extraordinarily complicated under subsection (c) of this section), if the administering authority concludes that such additional time is necessary to make the required determination concerning upstream subsidization.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Public interest factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether, based upon the relative impact on consumer prices and the availability of supplies of the merchandise, the agreement would have a greater adverse impact on United States consumers than the imposition of countervailing duties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall, to the extent practicable, consult with&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreements eliminating injurious effect</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 75 days after the date of the preliminary determination under section 1671b(b) of this title, the administering authority shall make a final determination of whether or not <!-- PDFPage:299 -->a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise; except that when an investigation under this part is initiated simultaneously with an investigation under part II of this subtitle, which involves imports of the same class or kind of merchandise from the same or other countries, the administering authority, if requested by the petitioner, shall extend the date of the final determination under this paragraph to the date of the final determination of the administering authority in such investigation initiated under part II of this subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Critical circumstances determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under section 1671b(e) of this title, shall also contain a finding as to whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such findings may be affirmative even though the preliminary determination under section 1671b(e)(1) of this title was negative.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) De minimis countervailable subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any countervailable subsidy that is de minimis as defined in section 1671b(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Final determination by Commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make a final determination of whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) of this section. If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title is affirmative, then the Commission shall make the determination required by paragraph (1) before the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the 120th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative preliminary determination under section 1671b(b) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the 45th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative final determination under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Period for injury determination following negative preliminary determination by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title is negative, and its final determination under subsection (a) of this section is affirmative, then the final determination by the Commission under this subsection shall be made within 75 days after the date of that affirmative final determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Factors to consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making the evaluation under clause (i), the Commission shall consider, among other factors it considers relevant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the timing and the volume of the imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) any rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the countervailing duty order will be seriously undermined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) of this section would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of that merchandise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title was negative, the administering authority shall order the suspension of liquidation under paragraph (2) of section 1671b(d) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Issuance of order; effect of negative determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determinations of the administering authority and the Commission under subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section are affirmative, then the administering authority shall issue a countervailing duty order under section 1671e(a) of this title.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Method for determining the all-others rate and the country-wide subsidy rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) All-others rate</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subsection and section 1671b(d) of this title, the all-others rate shall be an amount equal to the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated, excluding any zero and de minimis countervailable subsidy rates, and any rates determined entirely under section 1677e of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the countervailable subsidy rates established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis rates, or are determined entirely under section 1677e of this title, the administering authority may use any reasonable method to establish an all-others rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated, including averaging the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates determined for the exporters and producers individually investigated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Country-wide subsidy rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority may calculate a single country-wide subsidy rate, applicable to all exporters and producers, if the administering authority limits its examination pursuant to section 1677f&ndash;1(e)(2)(B) of this title. The estimated country-wide rate determined under section 1671b(d)(1)(A)(ii) of this title or paragraph (1)(B)(i)(II) of this subsection shall be based on industry-wide data regarding the use of subsidies determined to be countervailable.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:301 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Publication of notice of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the administering authority or the Commission makes a determination under this section, it shall notify the petitioner, other parties to the investigation, and the other agency of its determination and of the facts and conclusions of law upon which the determination is based, and it shall publish notice of its determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Correction of ministerial errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;ministerial error&rdquo; includes errors in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) directs customs officers to assess a countervailing duty equal to the amount of the net countervailable subsidy determined or estimated to exist, within 6 months after the date <!-- PDFPage:302 -->on which the administering authority receives satisfactory information upon which the assessment may be based, but in no event later than 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which the merchandise is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,</p>
