<p class="statutory-body">The fee which is charged under subsection (a) of this section shall be paid by each person using the customs services at the airport, seaport, or other facility and shall be in an amount equal to the expenses incurred by the Secretary of the Treasury in providing the customs services which are rendered to such person at such airport, seaport, or other facility (including the salary and expenses of individuals employed by the Secretary of the Treasury to provide such customs services).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Justification for service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury may designate airports, seaports, and other facilities under this subsection. An airport, seaport, or other facility may be designated under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary of the Treasury has made a determination that the volume or value of business cleared through such airport, seaport, or other facility is insufficient to justify the availability of customs services at such airport, seaport, or other facility, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Failure to pay fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who, after notice and demand for payment of any fee charged under subsection (a) of this section, fails to pay such fee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and if convicted thereof shall pay a fine that does not exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of such fee.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay out of any funds available in such account any expenses incurred by the Federal Government in providing customs services at such airport, seaport, or other facility (including expenses incurred for the salaries and expenses of individuals employed to provide such services). None of the funds deposited into such account shall be available for any purpose other than making payments authorized under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Customs services for foreign trade zones or subzones</h4>
