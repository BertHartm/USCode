<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Monitoring and enforcement structure recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the preparation of the recommendations for the reorganization of trade functions, the President shall ensure that careful consideration is given to monitoring and enforcing the requirements of the Agreement and this subchapter, with particular regard to the tendering procedures required by the Agreement or otherwise agreed to by a country or instrumentality likely to be designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules of origin</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Advisory rulings and final determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide for the prompt issuance of advisory rulings and final determinations on whether, under section 2518(4)(B) of this title, an article is or would be a product of a foreign country or instrumentality designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalties for fraudulent conduct</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to any other provisions of law which may be applicable, section 1001 of title 18 shall apply to fraudulent conduct with respect to the origin of products for purposes of qualifying for a waiver under section 2511 of this title or avoiding a prohibition under section 2512 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report to Congress on rules of origin</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Domestic administrative practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As soon as practicable after the close of the two-year period beginning on the date on which any waiver under section 2511(a) of this title first takes effect, the President shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report containing an evaluation of administrative practices under any provision of law which requires determinations to be made of the country of origin of goods, products, commodities, or other articles of commerce. Such evaluation shall be accompanied by the President's recommendations for legislative and executive measures required to improve and simplify and to make more uniform and consistent such practices. Such evaluation and recommendations shall take into account the special <!-- PDFPage:554 -->problems affecting insular possessions of the United States with respect to such practices.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Foreign administrative practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The report required under paragraph (1) shall contain an evaluation of the administrative practices under the laws of each major industrial country which require determinations to be made of the country of origin of goods, products, commodities, or other articles of commerce, including an assessment of such practices on the exports of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Annual report on foreign discrimination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Annual report required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall, no later than April 30 of each year, submit to the appropriate committees of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, as well as other appropriate Senate committees, a report on the extent to which foreign countries discriminate against United States products or services in making government procurements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Identifications required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the annual report, the President shall identify (and continue to identify subject to subsections (f)(5) and (g)(3) of this section) any countries, other than least developed countries, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are signatories to the Agreement and not in compliance with the requirements of the Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) are signatories to the Agreement; (ii) are in compliance with the Agreement but, in the government procurement of products or services not covered by the Agreement, maintain a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against United States products or services which results in identifiable harm to United States businesses; and (iii) whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government; or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2515_1_target" name="2515_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) are not signatories to the Agreement; (ii) maintain, in government procurement, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against United States products or services which results in identifiable harm to United States businesses; and (iii) whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.<sup><a href="#2515_2_target" name="2515_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) are not signatories to the Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fail to apply transparent and competitive procedures to its government procurement equivalent to those in the Agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E)(i) are not signatories to the Agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fail to maintain and enforce effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with government procurement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Considerations in making identifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the identifications required by paragraph (1), the President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use the requirements of the Agreement, government procurement practices, and the effects of such practices on United States businesses as a basis for evaluating whether the procurement practices of foreign governments do not provide fair market opportunities for United States products or services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account, among other factors, whether and to what extent countries that are signatories to the Agreement, and other countries described in paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures for procurements that could have been conducted using competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) conduct what normally would have been one procurement as two or more procurements, to decrease the anticipated contract values below the Agreement's value threshold or to make the procurements less attractive to United States businesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) announce procurement opportunities with inadequate time intervals for United States businesses to submit bids; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) use specifications in such a way as to limit the ability of United States suppliers to participate in procurements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) use any other additional criteria deemed appropriate, including the failure to maintain and enforce effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with government procurement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contents of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reports required by this subsection shall include, with respect to each country identified under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1), the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a description of the specific nature of the discrimination, including (for signatory countries) any provision of the Agreement with which the country is not in compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an identification of the United States products or services that are affected by the noncompliance or discrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an analysis of the impact of the noncompliance or discrimination on the commerce of the United States and the ability of United States companies to compete in foreign government procurement markets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a description of the status, action taken, and disposition of cases of noncompliance or discrimination identified in the preceding annual report with respect to such country.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Information and advice from Government agencies and United States businesses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing the annual reports required by this subsection, the President shall seek information and advice from executive agencies <!-- PDFPage:555 -->through the interagency trade organization established under section 1872(a) of this title, and from United States businesses in the United States and in countries that are signatories to the Agreement and in other foreign countries whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Impact of noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall take into account, in identifying countries in the annual report and in any action required by this section, the relative impact of any noncompliance with the Agreement or of other discrimination on United States commerce and the extent to which such noncompliance or discrimination has impeded the ability of United States suppliers to participate in procurements on terms comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question when seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Impact on procurement costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such report shall also include an analysis of the impact on United States Government procurement costs that may occur as a consequence of any sanctions that may be required by subsection (f) or (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No later than the date the annual report is submitted under subsection (d)(1) of this section, the United States Trade Representative, on behalf of the United States, shall request consultations with any countries identified in the report to obtain their compliance with the Agreement or the elimination of their discriminatory procurement practices unless the country is identified as discriminatory pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this section in the preceding annual report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procedures with respect to violations of Agreement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initiation of dispute settlement procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within 60 days after the annual report is submitted under subsection (d)(1) of this section, a signatory country identified pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2515_3_target" name="2515_3">3</a></sup> of this section has not complied with the Agreement, then the United States Trade Representative shall promptly request proceedings on the matter under the formal dispute settlement procedures provided under the Agreement unless such proceedings are already underway pursuant to the identification of the signatory country under subsection (d)(1) of this section as not in compliance in a preceding annual report.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Settlement of disputes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, before the end of the 18 months following the initiation of dispute settlement procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the other participant to the dispute settlement procedures has complied with the Agreement,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the other participant to the procedures takes the action recommended as a result of the procedures to the satisfaction of the President,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the procedures result in a determination providing a specific period of time for the other participant to bring its practices into compliance with the Agreement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the procedures result in a determination requiring no action by the other participant,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the President shall take no action to limit Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2515_4_target" name="2515_4">4</a></sup> procurement from that participant.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Failures resulting in sanctions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If subparagraph (A) applies to any signatory country&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Withholding and modification of sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President determines that imposing or continuing the sanctions required by subclause (I) or (II) of paragraph (3)(B)(i) would harm the public interest of the United States, the President may, to the extent necessary to apply appropriate limitations that are equiva<!-- PDFPage:556 -->lent, in their effect, to the noncompliance with the Agreement by that signatory country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) withhold the imposition of either (but not both) of such sanctions;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the President shall identify such country as a country that maintains, in government procurement, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against United States products or services which results in identifiable harm to United States businesses; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) would, with respect to any procurement or class of procurements, result in an insufficient number of potential or actual bidders to assure procurement of services, articles, materials, or supplies of requisite quality at competitive prices.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advice from U.S. agencies and businesses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President, in taking any action under this subsection to limit government procurements from foreign countries, shall seek the advice of executive agencies through the interagency trade organization established under section 1872(a) of this title and the advice of United States businesses and other interested parties.</p>
