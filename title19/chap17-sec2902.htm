<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such foreign country requests the negotiation of such an agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the President, at least 60 days before the date notice is provided under section 2903(a)(1)(A) of this title&mdash;</p>
