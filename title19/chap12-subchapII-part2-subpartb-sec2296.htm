<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for unemployment insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A worker may not be determined to be ineligible or disqualified for unemployment insurance or program benefits under this subpart because the individual is in training approved under subsection (a) of this section, because of leaving work which is not suitable employment to enter such training, or because of the application to any such week in training of provisions of State law or Federal unemployment insurance law relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work. The Secretary shall submit to the Congress a quarterly report regarding the amount of funds expended during the quarter concerned to provide training under subsection (a) of this section and the anticipated demand for such funds for any remaining quarters in the fiscal year concerned.</p>
