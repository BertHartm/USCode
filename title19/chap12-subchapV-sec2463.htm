<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the President is authorized to designate articles as eligible articles from all beneficiary developing countries for purposes of this subchapter by Executive order or Presidential proclamation after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Least-developed beneficiary developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except for articles described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (E) of subsection (b)(1) of this section and articles described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of this section, the President may, in carrying out section 2462(d)(1) of this title and subsection (c)(1) of this section, designate articles as eligible articles only for countries designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries under section 2462(a)(2) of this title if, after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from least-developed beneficiary developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Three-year rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission under subsection (e) of this section, an article has been formally considered for designation as an eligible article under this subchapter and denied such designation, such article may not be reconsidered for such designation for a period of 3 years after such denial.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of origin</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The duty-free treatment provided under this subchapter shall apply to any eligible article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that article is imported directly from a beneficiary developing country into the customs territory of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the cost or value of the materials produced in the beneficiary developing country or any two or more such countries that are members of the same association of countries and are treated as one country under section 2467(2) of this title, plus</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) simple combining or packaging operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:597 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the United States Trade Representative, shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out paragraph (2), including, but not limited to, regulations providing that, in order to be eligible for duty-free treatment under this subchapter, an article&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) must be a new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the beneficiary developing country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Articles that may not be designated as eligible articles</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Import-sensitive articles</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations by the President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making any determination under paragraph (1), the President shall give great weight to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such country provides adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other bases for waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President may waive the application of subsection (c)(2) of this section if, before July 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in subsection (c)(2) of this section was made with respect to a beneficiary developing country, the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there has been a historical preferential trade relationship between the United States and such country,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is a treaty or trade agreement in force covering economic relations between such country and the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such country does not discriminate against, or impose unjustifiable or unreasonable barriers to, United States commerce,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and the President publishes that determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitations on waivers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other waiver limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President may not exercise the waiver authority provided under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which exceeds 15 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that have entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year from those beneficiary developing countries which for the preceding calendar year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) had a per capita gross national product (calculated on the basis of the best available information, including that of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) of $5,000 or more; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) had exported (either directly or indirectly) to the United States a quantity of articles that was duty-free under this subchapter that had an aggregate appraised value of more than 10 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during that year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Calculation of limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There shall be counted against the limitations imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for any calendar year only that value of any eligible article of any country that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:599 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) entered duty-free under this subchapter during such calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is in excess of the value of that article that would have been so entered during such calendar year if the limitations under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section applied.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effective period of waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any waiver granted under this subsection shall remain in effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) International Trade Commission advice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before designating articles as eligible articles under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the President shall publish and furnish the International Trade Commission with lists of articles which may be considered for designation as eligible articles for purposes of this subchapter. The provisions of sections 2151, 2152, 2153, and 2154 of this title shall be complied with as though action under section 2461 of this title and this section were action under section 2133 of this title to carry out a trade agreement entered into under section 2133 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special rule concerning Puerto Rico</h4>
