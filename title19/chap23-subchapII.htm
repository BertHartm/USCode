<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Apparel articles cut and assembled in beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) agrees to require all producers and exporters of covered articles in that country to maintain complete records of the production and the export of covered articles, including materials used in the production, for at least 2 years after the production or export (as the case may be); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) agrees to report, on a timely basis, at the request of the United States Customs Service, documentation establishing the country of origin of covered articles as used by that country in implementing an effective visa system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Country of origin documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(F), documentation regarding the country of origin of the covered articles includes documentation such as production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, the number of workers employed in production, and certification from both the manufacturer and the exporter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Customs procedures and enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any importer that claims preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title shall comply with customs procedures similar in all material respects to the requirements of Article 502(1) of the NAFTA as implemented pursuant to United States law, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In order to qualify for the preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title and for a Certificate of Origin to be valid with respect to any article for which such treatment is claimed, there shall be in effect a determination by the President that each country described in clause (ii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) has implemented and follows; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is making substantial progress toward implementing and following,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;procedures and requirements similar in all material respects to the relevant procedures and requirements under chapter 5 of the NAFTA.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Country described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A country is described in this clause if it is a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) from which the article is exported; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in which materials used in the production of the article originate or in which the article or such materials, undergo production that contributes to a claim that the article is eligible for preferential treatment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certificate of Origin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Certificate of Origin that otherwise would be required pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) shall not be required in the case of an article imported under section 3721 of this title if such Certificate of Origin would not be required under Article 503 of the NAFTA (as implemented pursuant to United States law), if the article were imported from Mexico.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Penalties for exporters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President determines, based on sufficient evidence, that an exporter has engaged in transshipment as defined in paragraph (4), then the President shall deny for a period of 5 years all benefits under section 3721 of this title to such exporter, any successor of such exporter, and any other entity owned or operated by the principal of the exporter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transshipment described</h4>

For purposes of this paragraph, false information is material if disclosure of the true information would mean or would have meant that the article is or was ineligible for preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title.</p>
