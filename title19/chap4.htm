<p class="statutory-body">Except as hereinafter provided, every article of foreign origin (or its container, as provided in subsection (b) hereof) imported into the United States shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of the article. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Determine the character of words and phrases or abbreviations thereof which shall be acceptable as indicating the country of origin and prescribe any reasonable method of marking, whether by printing, stenciling, stamping, branding, labeling, or by any other reasonable method, and a conspicuous place on the article (or container) where the marking shall appear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Require the addition of any other words or symbols which may be appropriate to prevent deception or mistake as to the origin of the article or as to the origin of any other article with which such imported article is usually combined subsequent to importation but before delivery to an ultimate purchaser; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Authorize the exception of any article from the requirements of marking if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such article is incapable of being marked;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States without injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States, except at an expense economically prohibitive of its importation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The marking of a container of such article will reasonably indicate the origin of such article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Such article is a crude substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Such article is imported for use by the importer and not intended for sale in its imported or any other form;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Such article is to be processed in the United States by the importer or for his account otherwise than for the purpose of concealing the origin of such article and in such manner that any mark contemplated by this section would necessarily be obliterated, destroyed, or permanently concealed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) An ultimate purchaser, by reason of the character of such article or by reason of the circumstances of its importation, must necessarily know the country of origin of such article even though it is not marked to indicate its origin;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Such article was produced more than twenty years prior to its importation into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) Such article is of a class or kind with respect to which the Secretary of the Treasury has given notice by publication in the weekly Treasury Decisions within two years after July 1, 1937, that articles of such class or kind were imported in substantial quantities during the five-year period immediately preceding January 1, 1937, and were not required during such period to be marked to indicate their origin: <em>Provided</em>, That this subdivision shall not apply after September 1, 1938, to sawed lumber and timbers, telephone, trolley, electric-light, and telegraph poles of wood, and bundles of shingles; but the President is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of this proviso if he finds such action required to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of sections 1351, 1352, 1353, 1354 of this title, as extended; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) Such article cannot be marked after importation except at any expense which is economically prohibitive, and the failure to mark the article before importation was not due to any purpose of the importer, producer, seller, or shipper to avoid compliance with this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an article is excepted under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section from the requirements of marking, the immediate container, if any, of such article, or such other container or containers of such article as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be marked in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of such article, subject to all provisions of this section, including the same exceptions as are applicable to articles under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section. If articles are excepted from marking requirements under clause (F), (G), or (H) of subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, their usual containers shall not be subject to the marking requirements of this section. Usual containers in use as such at the time of importation shall in no case be required to be marked to show the country of their own origin.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, because of the nature of an article, it is technically or commercially infeasible to mark it by one of the five methods specified in paragraph (1), the article may be marked by an equally permanent method of marking or, in the case of small diameter pipe, tube, and fittings, by tagging the containers or bundles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Marking of compressed gas cylinders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No exception may be made under subsection (a)(3) of this section with respect to compressed gas cylinders designed to be used for the transport and storage of compressed gases whether or not certified prior to exportation to have been made in accordance with the safety requirements of sections 178.36 through 178.68 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, each of which shall be marked with the English name of the country of origin by means of die stamping, molding, etching, raised lettering, or an equally permanent method of marking.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the United States attorney is of the opinion that no prejudice to such investigation will result from such referral, such attorney shall immediately so notify the Customs Service in writing.

In such cases, the actions described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection shall take place within sufficient time to allow for the filing of a forfeiture complaint within 21 days of seizure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the United States attorney for the district of the addressee's residence concludes that material prejudice to such investigation will result from such referral, such United States attorney shall place on file, within 14 days of the date of seizure, a dated certification stating that it is the United States attorney's judgment that referral of the matter for forfeiture under this section would materially affect the Government's ability to conduct a criminal investigation with respect to the seizure. The certification shall set forth specific, articulable facts demonstrating that withholding referral for forfeiture is necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) As soon as the circumstances change so that withholding of referral for forfeiture is no longer necessary for purposes of the criminal investigation, the United States attorney shall immediately so notify the Customs Service in writing and shall furnish a copy of the certification described in paragraph (4) above to the Customs Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any matter referred to a United States attorney for possible criminal prosecution wherein subparagraph (5)(A) does not apply, the United States attorney shall immediately notify the Customs Service in writing concerning the disposition of the matter, whether by institution of a prosecution or a letter of declination, and shall also furnish a copy of the certification described in paragraph (4) of this subsection to the Customs Service.</p>

<p class="note-body">In Import Alert 66&ndash;47, the Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;) excluded the drug Mifepristine&mdash;commonly known as RU&ndash;486&mdash;from the list of drugs that individuals can import into the United States for their &ldquo;personal use,&rdquo; although the drugs have not yet been approved for distribution by the FDA. (<em>See</em> FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual, Chapter 9&ndash;71.) Import Alert 66&ndash;47 effectively bans the importation into this Nation of a drug that is used in other nations as a nonsurgical means of abortion.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am informed that in excluding RU&ndash;486 from the personal use importation exemption, the FDA appears to <!-- PDFPage:71 -->have based its decision on factors other than an assessment of the possible health and safety risks of the drug. Accordingly, I hereby direct that you promptly instruct the FDA to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant exclusion of RU&ndash;486 from the list of drugs that qualify for the personal use importation exemption. Furthermore, if the FDA concludes that RU&ndash;486 meets the criteria for the personal use importation exemption, I direct that you immediately take steps to rescind Import Alert 66&ndash;47.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, I direct that you promptly assess initiatives by which the Department of Health and Human Services can promote the testing, licensing, and manufacturing in the United States of RU&ndash;486 or other antiprogestins.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;476, title I, &sect;1442, Nov. 9, 2000, 114 Stat. 2163, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in <!-- PDFPage:74 -->a wide variety of products, including fur coats and jackets, fur trimmed garments, hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed animals, and other toys.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The United States represents one of the largest markets for the sale of fur and fur products in the world. Market demand for fur products in the United States has led to the introduction of dog and cat fur products into United States commerce, frequently based on deceptive or fraudulent labeling of the products to disguise the true nature of the fur and mislead United States wholesalers, retailers, and consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other furs such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink, and synthetic materials made to resemble real fur. Dog and cat fur is generally less expensive than other types of fur and may be used as a substitute for more expensive types of furs, which provides an incentive to engage in unfair or fraudulent trade practices in the importation, exportation, distribution, or sale of fur products, including deceptive labeling and other practices designed to disguise the true contents or origin of the product.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Forensic texts have documented that dog and cat fur products are being imported into the United States subject to deceptive labels or other practices designed to conceal the use of dog or cat fur in the production of wearing apparel, toys, and other products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Publicly available evidence reflects ongoing significant use of dogs and cats bred expressly for their fur by foreign fur producers for manufacture into wearing apparel, toys, and other products that have been introduced into United States commerce. The evidence indicates that foreign fur producers also rely on the use of stray dogs and cats and stolen pets for the manufacture of fur products destined for the world and United States markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated and inhumane.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The trade of dog and cat fur products is ethically and aesthetically abhorrent to United States citizens. Consumers in the United States have a right to know if products offered for sale contain dog or cat fur and to ensure that they are not unwitting participants in this gruesome trade.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Persons who engage in the sale of dog or cat fur products, including the fraudulent trade practices identified above, gain an unfair competitive advantage over persons who engage in legitimate trade in apparel, toys, and other products, and derive an unfair benefit from consumers who buy their products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The imposition of a ban on the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, transportation, and distribution of dog and cat fur products, regardless of their source, is consistent with the international obligations of the United States because it applies equally to domestic and foreign producers and avoids any discrimination among foreign sources of competing products. Such a ban is also consistent with provisions of international agreements to which the United States is a party that expressly allow for measures designed to protect the health and welfare of animals and to enjoin the use of deceptive trade practices in international or domestic commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter [chapter 3 (&sect;&sect;1441&ndash;1443) of subtitle B of title I of Pub. L. 106&ndash;476, see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note set out under section 1654 of this title] are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) prohibit imports, exports, sale, manufacture, offer for sale, transportation, and distribution in the United States of dog and cat fur products, in order to ensure that United States market demand does not provide an incentive to slaughter dogs or cats for their fur;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) require accurate labeling of fur species so that consumers in the United States can make informed choices and ensure that they are not unwitting contributors to this gruesome trade; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) ensure that the customs laws of the United States are not undermined by illicit international traffic in dog and cat fur products.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Articles removed in, or returned to, the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any article exempted from duty or tax, or in respect of which drawback has been allowed, under this section or section 1317 of this title and thereafter removed in the United States from any vessel or aircraft, or otherwise returned to the United States, shall be treated as an importation from a foreign country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reciprocal privileges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The privileges granted by this section and section 1317 of this title in respect of aircraft registered in a foreign country shall be allowed only if the Secretary of the Treasury shall have been advised by the Secretary of Commerce that he has found that such foreign country allows, or will allow, substantially reciprocal privileges in respect of aircraft registered in the United States. If the Secretary of Commerce shall advise the Secretary of the Treasury that he has found that a foreign country has discontinued, or will discontinue, the allowance of such privileges, the privileges granted by this section and such section 1317 shall not apply thereafter in respect of aircraft registered in that foreign country.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) are made, produced, processed, or mined under, or by means of, a process covered by the claims of a valid and enforceable United States patent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The importation into the United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation by the owner, importer, or consignee, of articles that infringe a valid and enforceable United States trademark registered under the Trademark Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The importation into the United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation by the owner, importer, or consignee, of a semiconductor chip product in a manner that constitutes infringement of a mask work registered under chapter 9 of title 17.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) apply only if an industry in the United States, relating to the articles protected by the patent, copyright, trademark, mask work, or design concerned, exists or is in the process of being established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), an industry in the United States shall be considered to exist if there is in the United States, with respect to the articles protected by the patent, copyright, trademark, mask work, or design concerned&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purposes of this section, the phrase &ldquo;owner, importer, or consignee&rdquo; includes any agent of the owner, importer, or consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigation of violations by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall investigate any alleged violation of this section on complaint under oath or upon its initiative. Upon commencing any such investigation, the Commission shall publish notice thereof in the Federal Register. The Commission shall conclude any such investigation and make its determination under this section at the earliest practicable time after the date of publication of notice of such investigation. To promote expeditious adjudication, the Commission shall, within 45 days after an investigation is initiated, establish a target date for its final determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the course of each investigation under this section, the Commission shall consult with, and seek advice and information from, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and such other departments and agencies as it considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever, in the course of an investigation under this section, the Commission has reason to believe, based on information before it, that a matter, in whole or in part, may come within the purview of part II of subtitle IV of this chapter, it shall promptly notify the Secretary of Commerce so that such action may be taken as is otherwise authorized by such part II. If the Commission has reason to believe that the matter before it (A) is based solely on alleged acts and effects which are within the purview of section 1671 or 1673 of this title, or (B) relates to an alleged copyright infringement with respect to which action is prohibited by section 1008 of title 17, the Commission shall terminate, or not institute, any investigation into the matter. If the Commission has reason to believe the matter before it is based in part on alleged acts and effects which are within the purview of section 1671 or 1673 of this title, and in part on alleged acts and effects which may, independently from or in conjunction with those within the purview of such section, establish a basis for relief under this section, then it may institute or continue an investigation into the matter. If the Commission notifies the Secretary or the administering authority (as defined in section 1677(1) of this title) with respect to a matter under this paragraph, the Commission may suspend its investigation during the time the matter is before the Secretary or administering authority for final decision. Any final decision by the administering authority under section 1671 or 1673 of this title with respect to the matter within such section 1671 or 1673 of this title of which the Commission has notified the Secretary or administering authority shall be conclusive upon the Commission with respect to the issue of less-than-fair-value sales or subsidization and the matters necessary for such decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determinations; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall determine, with respect to each investigation conducted by it under this section, whether or not there is a violation of this section, except that the Commission may, by issuing a consent order or on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to the investigation, including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration, terminate any such investigation, in whole or in part, without making such a determination. Each determination under subsection (d) or (e) of this section shall be made on the record after notice and opportunity for a hearing in conformity with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. All legal and equitable defenses may be presented in all cases. A respondent may raise any counterclaim in a manner prescribed by the Commission. Immediately after a counterclaim is received by the Commission, the respondent raising such counterclaim shall file a notice of removal with a United States district court in which venue for any of the counterclaims raised by the party would exist under section 1391 of title 28. Any counterclaim raised pursuant to this section shall relate back to the date of the original complaint in the proceeding before the Commission. Action on such counterclaim shall not delay or affect the proceeding under this section, including the legal and equitable defenses that may be raised under this subsection. Any person adversely affected by a final determination of the Commission under subsection (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section may appeal such determination, within 60 days after the determination becomes final, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for review in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, Commission determinations under subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section with respect to its findings on the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, the amount and nature of bond, or the appropriate remedy shall be reviewable in accordance with section 706 of title 5. Determinations by the Commission under subsections (e), (f), and (j) of this section with respect to forfeiture of bonds and under subsection (h) of this section with respect to the imposition of sanctions for abuse of discovery or abuse of process shall also be reviewable in accordance with section 706 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusion of articles from entry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines, as a result of an investigation under this section, that there is a violation of this section, it shall direct that the articles concerned, imported by any person violating the provision of this section, be excluded from entry into the United States, unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon re<!-- PDFPage:110 -->ceipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers, refuse such entry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the Commission to order an exclusion from entry of articles shall be limited to persons determined by the Commission to be violating this section unless the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a general exclusion from entry of articles is necessary to prevent circumvention of an exclusion order limited to products of named persons; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is a pattern of violation of this section and it is difficult to identify the source of infringing products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion of articles from entry during investigation except under bond; procedures applicable; preliminary relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, during the course of an investigation under this section, the Commission determines that there is reason to believe that there is a violation of this section, it may direct that the articles concerned, imported by any person with respect to whom there is reason to believe that such person is violating this section, be excluded from entry into the United States, unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers, refuse such entry, except that such articles shall be entitled to entry under bond prescribed by the Secretary in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the complainant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A complainant may petition the Commission for the issuance of an order under this subsection. The Commission shall make a determination with regard to such petition by no later than the 90th day after the date on which the Commission's notice of investigation is published in the Federal Register. The Commission may extend the 90-day period for an additional 60 days in a case it designates as a more complicated case. The Commission shall publish in the Federal Register its reasons why it designated the case as being more complicated. The Commission may require the complainant to post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of an order under this subsection. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has not violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the respondent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may grant preliminary relief under this subsection or subsection (f) of this section to the same extent as preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders may be granted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall prescribe the terms and conditions under which bonds may be forfeited under paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Cease and desist orders; civil penalty for violation of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to, or in lieu of, taking action under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the Commission may issue and cause to be served on any person violating this section, or believed to be violating this section, as the case may be, an order directing such person to cease and desist from engaging in the unfair methods or acts involved, unless after considering the effect of such order upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such order should not be issued. The Commission may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it deems proper, modify or revoke any such order, and, in the case of a revocation, may take action under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as the case may be. If a temporary cease and desist order is issued in addition to, or in lieu of, an exclusion order under subsection (e) of this section, the Commission may require the complainant to post a bond, in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the respondent from any injury, as a prerequisite to the issuance of an order under this subsection. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has not violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the respondent. The Commission shall prescribe the terms and conditions under which the bonds may be forfeited under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who violates an order issued by the Commission under paragraph (1) after it has become final shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty for each day on which an importation of articles, or their sale, occurs in violation of the order of not more than the greater of $100,000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold on such day in violation of the order. Such penalty shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered for the United States in a civil action brought by the Commission in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation occurs. In such actions, the United States district courts may issue mandatory injunctions incorporating the relief sought by the Commission as they deem appropriate in the enforcement of such final orders of the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the authority of the Commission to issue a general exclusion from entry of articles when a respondent appears to contest an investigation concerning a violation of the provisions of this section, a general exclusion from entry of articles, regardless of the source or importer of the articles, may be issued if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) no person appears to contest an investigation concerning a violation of the provisions of this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such a violation is established by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to taking action under subsection (d) of this section, the Commission may issue an order providing that any article imported in violation of the provisions of this section be seized and forfeited to the United States if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the article was previously denied entry into the United States by reason of an order issued under subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) upon such previous denial of entry, the Secretary of the Treasury provided the owner, importer, or consignee of the article written notice of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such order, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the seizure and forfeiture that would result from any further attempt to import the article into the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transmit to the President a copy of such determination and the action taken under subsection (d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) of this section, with respect thereto, together with the record upon which such determination is based.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, before the close of the 60-day period beginning on the day after the day on which he receives a copy of such determination, the President, for policy reasons, disapproves such determination and notifies the Commission of his disapproval, then, effective on the date of such notice, such determination and the action taken under subsection (d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) of this section with respect thereto shall have no force or effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsections (f) and (j) of this section, any exclusion from entry or order under this section shall continue in effect until the Commission finds, and in the case of exclusion from entry notifies the Secretary of the Treasury, that the conditions which led to such exclusion from entry or order no longer exist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any person who has previously been found by the Commission to be in violation of this section petitions the Commission for a de<!-- PDFPage:112 -->termination that the petitioner is no longer in violation of this section or for a modification or rescission of an exclusion from entry or order under subsection (d), (e), (f), (g), or (i) of this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Imposes, directly or indirectly, upon the disposition in or transportation in transit through or reexportation from such country of any article wholly or in part the growth or product of the United States any unreasonable charge, exaction, regulation, or limitation <!-- PDFPage:116 -->which is not equally enforced upon the like articles of every foreign country; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Discriminates in fact against the commerce of the United States, directly or indirectly, by law or administrative regulation or practice, by or in respect to any customs, tonnage, or port duty, fee, charge, exaction, classification, regulation, condition, restriction, or prohibition, in such manner as to place the commerce of the United States at a disadvantage compared with the commerce of any foreign country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion from importation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If at any time the President shall find it to be a fact that any foreign country has not only discriminated against the commerce of the United States, as aforesaid, but has, after the issuance of a proclamation as authorized in subdivision (a) of this section, maintained or increased its said discriminations against the commerce of the United States, the President is authorized, if he deems it consistent with the interests of the United States, to issue a further proclamation directing that such products of said country or such articles imported in its vessels as he shall deem consistent with the public interests shall be excluded from importation into the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application of proclamation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Ascertainment by Commission of discriminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the commission to ascertain and at all times to be informed whether any of the discriminations against the commerce of the United States enumerated in subdivisions (a), (b), and (e) of this section are practiced by any country; and if and when such discriminatory acts are disclosed, it shall be the duty of the commission to bring the matter to the attention of the President, together with recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rules and regulations of Secretary of the Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury with the approval of the President shall make such rules and regulations as are necessary for the execution of such proclamations as the President may issue in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Before entering into negotiations concerning any proposed foreign trade agreement under section 1351 of this title, the President shall furnish the United States International Trade Commission (hereinafter in sections 1352(a), (c), 1354, and 1360 to 1367 of this title, and section 624(b) of title 7, referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) with a list of all articles imported into the United States to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions, imposition of additional import restrictions, or continuance of existing customs or excise treatment. Upon receipt of such list the Commission shall make an investigation and report to the President the findings of the Commission with respect to each such article as to (1) the limit to which such modification, imposition, or continuance may be extended in order to carry out the purpose of said section without causing or threatening serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles; and (2) if increases in duties or additional import restrictions are required to avoid serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles the minimum increases in duties or additional import restrictions required. Such report shall be made by the Commission to the President not later than six months after the receipt of such list by the Commission. No such foreign trade agreement shall be entered into until the Commission has made its report to the President or until the expiration of the six-month period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures and determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the course of any investigation pursuant to this section the Commission shall hold hearings and give reasonable public notice thereof, and shall afford reasonable opportunity for parties interested to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard at such hearings. If in the course of any such investigation the Commission shall find with respect to any article on the list upon which a tariff concession has been granted that an increase in duty or additional import restriction is required to avoid serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles, the Commission shall promptly institute an investigation with respect to that article pursuant to section 1364 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In each such investigation the Commission shall, to the extent practicable and without excluding other factors, ascertain for the last calendar year preceding the investigation the average invoice price on a country-of-origin basis (converted into currency of the United States in accordance with the provisions of section 5151 of title 31) at which the foreign article was sold for export to the United States, and the average prices at which the like or directly competitive domestic articles were sold at wholesale in the principal markets of the United States. The Commission shall also, to the extent practicable, estimate for each article on the list the maximum increase in annual imports which may occur without causing serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles. The Commission shall request the executive departments and agencies for information in their possession concerning prices and other economic data from the principal supplier foreign country of each such article.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to all cargo to be exported that is moved by a vessel carrier from a port in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Documentation required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No shipper of cargo subject to this section (including an ocean transportation intermediary that is a non-vessel-operating common carrier (as defined in section 1702(17)(B) of title 46, Appendix)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1431a_1_target" name="1431a_1">1</a></sup> may tender or cause to be tendered to a vessel carrier cargo subject to this section for loading on a vessel in a United States port, unless such cargo is properly documented pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection, cargo shall be considered properly documented if the shipper submits to the vessel carrier or its agent a complete set of shipping documents no later than 24 hours after the cargo is delivered to the marine terminal operator, but under no circumstances later than 24 hours prior to departure of the vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A complete set of shipping documents shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for shipments for which a shipper's export declaration is required, a copy of the export declaration or, if the shipper files such declarations electronically in the Automated Export System, the complete bill of lading, and the master or equivalent shipping instructions, including the Internal Transaction Number (ITN); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for shipments for which a shipper's export declaration is not required, a shipper's export declaration exemption statement and such other documents or information as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the time, manner, and form by which shippers shall transmit documents or information required under this subsection to the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loading undocumented cargo prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No marine terminal operator (as defined in section 1702(14) of title 46, Appendix) may load, or cause to be loaded, any cargo subject to this section on a vessel unless instructed by the vessel carrier operating the vessel that such cargo has been properly documented in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When cargo is booked by 1 vessel carrier to be transported on the vessel of another vessel carrier, the booking carrier shall notify the operator of the vessel that the cargo has been properly documented in accordance with this section. The operator of the vessel may rely on such notification in releasing the cargo for loading aboard the vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reporting of undocumented cargo</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A vessel carrier shall notify the Customs Service of any cargo tendered to such carrier that is not properly documented pursuant to this section and that has remained in the marine terminal for more than 48 hours after being delivered to the marine terminal, and the location of the cargo in the marine terminal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sharing arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For vessel carriers that are members of vessel sharing agreements (or any other arrangement whereby a carrier moves cargo on another carrier's vessel), the vessel carrier accepting the booking shall be responsible for reporting undocumented cargo, without regard to whether it operates the vessel on which the transportation is to be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reassignment to another vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, if merchandise has been tendered to a marine terminal operator and subsequently reassigned for carriage on another vessel, the merchandise shall be considered properly documented if the information provided reflects carriage on the previously assigned vessel and otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, it shall be the responsibility of the vessel carrier to notify the Customs Service promptly of any reassignment of merchandise for carriage on a vessel other than the vessel on which the merchandise was originally assigned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Multiple containers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a single shipment is comprised of multiple containers, the 48-hour period described in paragraph (1) shall begin to run from the time the last container of the shipment is delivered to the marine terminal operator. It shall be the responsibility of the person tendering the cargo to inform the carrier that the shipment consists of multiple containers that will be delivered to the marine terminal operator at different times as part of a single shipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assessment of penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whoever is found to have violated subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the United States for civil penalties in a monetary amount up to the value of the cargo, or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Seizure of undocumented cargo</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cargo that is not properly documented pursuant to this section and has remained in the <!-- PDFPage:141 -->marine terminal for more than 48 hours after being delivered to the marine terminal operator shall be subject to search, seizure, and forfeiture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The shipper of any such cargo is liable to the marine terminal operator and to the ocean carrier for demurrage and other applicable charges for any undocumented cargo which has been notified to or searched or seized by the Customs Service for the entire period the cargo remains under the order and direction of the Customs Service. Unless the cargo is seized by the Customs Service and forfeited, the marine terminal operator and the ocean carrier shall have a lien on the cargo for the amount of the demurrage and other charges.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect on other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed, interpreted, or applied to relieve or excuse any party from compliance with any obligation or requirement arising under any other law, regulation, or order with regard to the documentation or carriage of cargo.</p>

The reconciliation shall be filed by the importer of record at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes but not later than 21 months after the date the importer declares his intent to file the reconciliation.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Signing and contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Entries shall be signed by the importer of record, or his agent, unless filed pursuant to an electronic data interchange system. If electronically filed, each transmission of data shall be certified by an importer of record or his agent, one of whom shall be resident in the United States for purposes of receiving service of process, as being true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, and such transmission shall be binding in the same manner and to the same extent as a signed document. The entry shall set forth such facts in regard to the importation as the Secretary may require and shall be accompanied by such invoices, bills of lading, certificates, and documents, or their electronically submitted equivalents, as are required by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, in prescribing regulations governing the content of entry documentation, shall require that entry documentation contain such information as may be necessary to determine whether the imported merchandise bears an infringing trademark in violation of section 1124 of title 15 or any other applicable law, including a trademark appearing on the goods or packaging.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Admissibility of data electronically transmitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any entry or other information transmitted by means of an authorized electronic data interchange system shall be admissible in any and all administrative and judicial proceedings as evidence of such entry or information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Special rule for foreign trade zone operations</h4>

The entry summary for the estimated entry or release shall cover only the merchandise actually withdrawn from the foreign trade zone during the 7-day period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury may require that the operator or user of the zone&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use an electronic data interchange approved by the Customs Service&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of merchandise that is purchased and invoiced as a single entity but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is shipped in an unassembled or disassembled condition in separate shipments due to the size or nature of the merchandise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is shipped in separate shipments due to the inability of the carrier to include all of the merchandise in a single shipment (at the instruction of the carrier),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Customs Service may, upon application by an importer in advance, treat such separate shipments for entry purposes as a single transaction.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1499. Examination of merchandise</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entry examination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Imported merchandise that is required by law or regulation to be inspected, examined, or appraised shall not be delivered from customs custody (except under such bond or other security as may be prescribed by the Secretary to assure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and instructions which the Secretary or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce) until the merchandise has been inspected, appraised, or examined and is reported by the Customs Service to have been truly and correctly invoiced and found to comply with the requirements of the laws of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate the packages or quantities of merchandise covered by any invoice or entry which are to be opened and examined for the purpose of appraisement or otherwise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall order such packages or quantities to be sent to such place as is designated by the Secretary by regulation for such purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may require such additional packages or quantities as the Secretary considers necessary for such purpose; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall inspect a sufficient number of shipments, and shall examine a sufficient number of entries, to ensure compliance with the laws enforced by the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Unspecified articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any package contains any article not specified in the invoice or entry and, in the opinion of the Customs Service, the article was omitted from the invoice or entry&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with fraudulent intent on the part of the seller, shipper, owner, agent, importer of record, or entry filer, the contents of the entire package in which such article is found shall be subject to seizure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without fraudulent intent, the value of the article shall be added to the entry and the duties, fees, and taxes thereon paid accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a deficiency is found in quantity, weight, or measure in the examination of any package, the person finding the deficiency shall make a report thereof to the Customs Service. The Customs Service shall make allowance for the deficiency in the liquidation of duties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Information required for release</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an examination is conducted, any information required for release shall be provided, either electronically or in paper form, to the Customs Service at the port of examination. The absence of such information does not limit the authority of the Customs Service to conduct an examination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Testing laboratories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Accreditation of private testing laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service shall establish and implement a procedure, under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, for accrediting private laboratories within the United States which may be used to perform tests (that would otherwise be performed by Customs Service laboratories) to establish the characteristics, quantities, or composition of imported merchandise. Such regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall establish the conditions required for the laboratories to receive and maintain accreditation for purposes of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall establish the conditions regarding the suspension and revocation of accreditation, which may include the imposition of a monetary penalty not to exceed $100,000 and such penalty is in addition to the recovery, from a gauger or laboratory accredited under paragraph (1), of any loss of revenue that may have occurred, but the Customs Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may seek to recover lost revenue only in cases where the gauger or laboratory in<!-- PDFPage:175 -->tentionally falsified the analysis or gauging report in collusion with the importer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall neither assess penalties nor seek to recover lost revenue because of a good faith difference of professional opinion; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge for accreditation and periodic reaccreditation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The collection of any charge for accreditation and reaccreditation under this section is not prohibited by section 58c(e)(6) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Appeal of adverse accreditation decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A laboratory applying for accreditation, or that is accredited, under this section may contest any decision or order of the Customs Service denying, suspending, or revoking accreditation, or imposing a monetary penalty, by commencing an action in accordance with chapter 169 of title 28 in the Court of International Trade within 60 days after issuance of the decision or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Testing by accredited laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When requested by an importer of record of merchandise, the Customs Service shall authorize the release to the importer of a representative sample of the merchandise for testing, at the expense of the importer, by a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1). The testing results from a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1) that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry shall, in the absence of testing results obtained from a Customs Service laboratory, be accepted by the Customs Service if the importer of record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the merchandise in the entry. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit in any way or preclude the authority of the Customs Service to test or analyze any sample or merchandise independently.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Availability of testing procedure, methodologies, and information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Testing procedures and methodologies used by the Customs Service, and information resulting from any testing conducted by the Customs Service, shall be made available as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Testing procedures and methodologies shall be made available upon request to any person unless the procedures or methodologies are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent related to such procedures or methodologies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Information resulting from testing shall be made available upon request to the importer of record and any agent thereof unless the information reveals information which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Miscellaneous provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any reference to a private laboratory includes a reference to a private gauger; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) accreditation of private laboratories extends only to the performance of functions by such laboratories that are within the scope of those responsibilities for determinations of the elements relating to admissibility, quantity, composition, or characteristics of imported merchandise that are vested in, or delegated to, the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Detentions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in the case of merchandise with respect to which the determination of admissibility is vested in an agency other than the Customs Service, the following apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within the 5-day period (excluding weekends and holidays) following the date on which merchandise is presented for customs examination, the Customs Service shall decide whether to release or detain the merchandise. Merchandise which is not released within such 5-day period shall be considered to be detained merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service shall issue a notice to the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise no later than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the decision to detain the merchandise is made. The notice shall advise the importer or other interested party of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the initiation of the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the specific reason for the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the anticipated length of the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the nature of any information which, if supplied to the Customs Service, may accelerate the disposition of the detention.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Testing results</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon request by the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise, the Customs Service shall provide the party with copies of the results of any testing conducted by the Customs Service on the merchandise and a description of the testing procedures and methodologies (unless such procedures or methodologies are proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent or were developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes). The results and test description shall be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Seizure and forfeiture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of failure to make determination</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulatory audit procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In conducting a regulatory audit under this section (which does not include a quantity verification for a customs bonded warehouse or general purpose foreign trade zone), the Customs Service auditor shall provide the person being audited, in advance of the audit, with a reasonable estimate of the time to be required for the audit. If in the course of an audit it becomes apparent that additional time will be required, the <!-- PDFPage:189 -->Customs Service auditor shall immediately provide a further estimate of such additional time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before commencing an audit, the Customs Service auditor shall inform the party to be audited of his right to an entry conference at which time the purpose will be explained and an estimated termination date set. Upon completion of on-site audit activities, the Customs Service auditor shall schedule a closing conference to explain the preliminary results of the audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in paragraph (5), if the estimated or actual termination date for an audit passes without the Customs Service auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the audit, the person being audited may petition in writing for such a conference to the officer designated pursuant to regulations, who, upon receipt of such a request, shall provide for such a conference to be held within 15 days after the date of receipt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as provided in paragraph (5), the Customs Service auditor shall complete the formal written audit report within 90 days following the closing conference unless the officer designated pursuant to regulations provides written notice to the person being audited of the reason for any delay and the anticipated completion date.

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply after the Customs Service commences a formal investigation with respect to the issue involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) If during the course of any audit concluded under this subsection, the Customs Service identifies overpayments of duties or fees or over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time period and scope of the audit that the Customs Service has defined, then in calculating the loss of revenue or monetary penalties under section 1592 of this title, the Customs Service shall treat the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as an offset to any underpayments or underdeclarations also identified on finally liquidated entries, if such overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize a refund not otherwise authorized under section 1520 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Service of summons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A summons issued pursuant to this section may be served by any person designated in the summons to serve it.

Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering the summons to an officer, or managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. The certificate of service signed by the person serving the summons is prima facie evidence of the facts it states on the hearing of an application for the enforcement of the summons. When the summons requires the production of records, such records shall be described in the summons with reasonable specificity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;third-party recordkeeper&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any customhouse broker, unless such customhouse broker is the importer of record on an entry;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then notice of such summons shall be given to any persons so identified within a reasonable time before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which such records are to be examined or testimony given. Such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the summons which has been served and shall contain directions for staying compliance with the summons under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any notice required under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be sufficient if such notice is served in the manner provided in subsection (b) of this section upon the person entitled to notice, or is mailed by certified or registered mail to the last known address of such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not apply to any summons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) served on the person with respect to whose liability for duties, fees, or taxes the summons is issued, or any officer or employee of such person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to determine whether or not records of the transactions described in section 1508 of this title of an identified person have been made or kept.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any person who is entitled to notice of a summons under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall have the right&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:190 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to intervene in any proceeding with respect to the enforcement of such summons under section 1510 of this title; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) No examination of any records required to be produced under a summons as to which notice is required under paragraph (2) of this subsection may be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) before the expiration of the period allowed for the notice not to comply under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The provisions of paragraphs (2) and (5) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any summons if, upon petition by the Secretary, the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) List of records and information</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Administrative review and modification of decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless a request for an accelerated disposition of a protest is filed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section the appropriate customs officer, within two years from the date a protest was filed in accordance with section 1514 of this title, shall review the protest and shall allow or deny such protest in whole or in part. Thereafter, any duties, charge, or exaction found to have been assessed or collected in excess shall be remitted or refunded and any drawback found due shall be paid. Upon the request of the protesting party, filed within the time allowed for the filing of a protest under section 1514 of this title, a protest may be subject to further review by another appropriate customs officer, under the circumstances and in the form and manner that may be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations, but subject to the two-year limitation prescribed in the first sentence of this subsection. Within 30 days from the date an application for further review is filed, the appropriate customs officer shall allow or deny the application and, if allowed, the protest shall be forwarded to the customs officer who will be conducting the further review. Notice of the denial of any protest shall be mailed in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary. Such notice shall include a statement of the reasons for the denial, as well as a statement informing the protesting party of his right to file a civil action contesting the denial of a protest under section 1514 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Request for accelerated disposition of protest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A request for accelerated disposition of a protest filed in accordance with section 1514 of this title may be mailed by certified or registered mail to the appropriate customs officer any time concurrent with or following the filing of such protest. For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, a protest which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in part within thirty days following the date of mailing by certified or registered mail of a request for accelerated disposition shall be deemed denied on the thirtieth day following mailing of such request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Request for set aside of denial of further review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a protesting party believes that an application for further review was erroneously or improperly denied or was denied without authority for such action, it may file with the Commissioner of Customs a written request that the denial of the application for further review be set aside. Such request must be filed within 60 days after the date of the notice of the denial. The Commissioner of Customs may review such request and, based solely on the information before the Customs Service at the time the application for further review was denied, may set aside the denial of the application for further review and void the denial of protest, if appropriate. If the Commissioner of Customs fails to act within 60 days after the date of the request, the request shall be considered denied. All denials of protests are effective from the date of original denial for purposes of section 2636 of title 28. If an action is commenced in the Court of International Trade that arises out of a protest or an application for further review, all administrative action pertaining to such protest or application shall terminate and any administrative action taken subsequent to the commencement of the action is null and void.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Voiding denial of protest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a protest is timely and properly filed, but is denied contrary to proper instructions, the Customs Service may on its own initiative, or pursuant to a written request by the protesting party filed with the appropriate port director within 90 days after the date of the protest denial, void the denial of the protest.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any master of any vessel and any person in charge of any vehicle bound to the United States who does not produce the manifest to the officer (whether of the Customs Service or the Coast Guard) demanding the same shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000, and if any merchandise, including sea stores, is found on board of or after having been unladen from such vessel or vehicle which is not included or described in said manifest or does not agree therewith, the master of such vessel or the person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be liable to a penalty equal to the lesser of $10,000 or the domestic value of the merchandise so found or unladen, and any such merchandise belonging or consigned to the master or other officer or to any of the crew of such vessel, or to the owner or person in charge of such vehicle, shall be subject to forfeiture, and if any merchandise described in such manifest is not found on board the vessel or vehicle the master or other person in charge or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be subject to a penalty of $1,000: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Customs Service shall be satisfied that the manifest was lost or mislaid without intentional fraud, or was defaced by accident, or is incorrect by reason of clerical error or other mistake and that no part of the merchandise not found on board was unshipped or discharged except as specified in the report of the master, said penalties shall not be incurred. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;clerical error&rdquo; means a nonnegligent, inadvertent, or typographical mistake in the preparation, assembly, or submission (electronically or otherwise) of the manifest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any of such merchandise so found consists of heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $500 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of crude opium, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for crude opium being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $200 for each ounce thereof so found. Such penalties shall, notwithstanding the proviso in section 1594 of this title (relating to the immunity of vessels or vehicles used as common carriers), constitute a lien upon such vessel which may be enforced by a libel in rem; except that the master or owner of a vessel used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as such common carrier shall not be <!-- PDFPage:234 -->liable to such penalties and the vessel shall not be held subject to the lien, if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that neither the master nor any of the officers (including licensed and unlicensed officers and petty officers) nor the owner of the vessel knew, and could not, by the exercise of the highest degree of care and diligence, have known, that such narcotic drugs were on board. Clearance of any such vessel may be withheld until such penalties are paid or until a bond, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is given for the payment thereof. The provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent the forfeiture of any such vessel or vehicle under any other provision of law. As used in this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;opiate&rdquo; and &ldquo;marihuana&rdquo; shall have the same meaning given those terms by sections 802(18) and 802(16), respectively, of title 21.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any of such merchandise (sea stores excepted), the importation of which into the United States is prohibited, be so found upon any vessel not exceeding five hundred net tons, the vessel shall, in addition to any other penalties herein or by law provided, be seized and forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a)(1) of this section and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue or electronically transmit to the person concerned a notice of intent to issue or electronically transmit a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) describe the merchandise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) set forth the details of the error in the manifest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specify all laws and regulations allegedly violated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) disclose all the material facts which establish the alleged violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) state the estimated loss of lawful duties, if any, and, taking into account all of the circumstances, the amount of the proposed monetary penalty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) inform such person that he will have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why such penalty claim should not be issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No notice is required under this subsection for any violation of subsection (a)(1) of this section for which the proposed penalty is $1,000 or less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a)(1) of this section, as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the Customs Service shall promptly issue or electronically transmit a statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, the Customs Service shall issue or electronically transmit a penalty claim to such person. The penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the violation did not affect the assessment of duties, 20 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prior disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of subsection (a) of this section before, or without knowledge of, the commencement of a formal investigation of such violation, with respect to such violation, merchandise shall not be seized and any monetary penalty to be assessed under subsection (c) of this section shall not exceed&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge. For purposes of this section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) of this section existed.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1593a. Penalties for false drawback claims</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person, by fraud, or negligence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may seek, induce or affect, or attempt to seek, induce, or affect, the payment or credit to that person or others of any drawback claim by means of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any document, written or oral statement, or electronically transmitted data or information, or act which is material and false, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any omission which is material; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may aid or abet any other person to violate subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Clerical errors or mistakes of fact are not violations of paragraph (1) unless they are part of a pattern of negligent conduct. The mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prepenalty notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a) of this section and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue to the person concerned a written notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) identify the drawback claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) set forth the details relating to the seeking, inducing, or affecting, or the attempted seeking, inducing, or affecting, or the aiding or procuring of, the drawback claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) specify all laws and regulations allegedly violated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) disclose all the material facts which establish the alleged violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) state whether the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud or negligence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) state the estimated actual or potential loss of revenue due to the drawback claim, and, taking into account all circumstances, the amount of the proposed monetary penalty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) inform such person that he shall have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why a claim for a monetary penalty should not be issued in the amount stated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Customs Service may not issue a prepenalty notice if the amount of the penalty in the penalty claim issued under paragraph (2) is $1,000 or less. In such cases, the Customs Service may proceed directly with a penalty claim.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No prepenalty notice in which the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud shall be issued without the prior approval of Customs Headquarters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalty claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a) of this section, as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the Customs Service shall promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, Customs shall issue a written penalty claim to such person. The written penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under clauses (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1)(A). Such person shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations, both oral and <!-- PDFPage:246 -->written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under section 1618 of this title, the Customs Service shall provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A fraudulent violation of subsection (a) of this section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Negligence</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A negligent violation of subsection (a) of this section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the 1st violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repetitive violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service determines that a repeat negligent violation occurs relating to the same issue, the penalty amount for the 2d violation shall be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the total actual or potential loss of revenue. The penalty amount for each succeeding repetitive negligent violation shall be in an amount not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue. If the same party commits a nonrepetitive violation, that violation shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prior disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of subsection (a) of this section before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the violation resulted from fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest applied under section 6621 of title 26 on the amount of actual revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived during the period that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) begins on the date of the overpayment of the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) ends on the date on which the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Condition affecting penalty limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitations in subparagraph (A) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed under this subsection apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on the claim at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such longer period as the Customs Service may provide), after notice by the Customs Service of its calculation of the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Commencement of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) of this section existed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exclusivity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Penalty claims under this section shall be the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback related violation of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deprivation of lawful revenue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1514 of this title, if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties and taxes resulting from a violation of subsection (a) of this section, the Customs Service shall require that such duties and taxes be restored whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Drawback compliance program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After consultation with the drawback trade community, the Customs Service shall establish a drawback compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest may participate after being certified by the Customs Service under paragraph (2). Participation in the drawback compliance program is voluntary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A party may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program after meeting the general requirements established under the program or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the party and the Customs Service. Certification requirements shall take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program and the volume of claims. In order to be certified, the participant must be able to demonstrate that it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) understands the legal requirements for filing claims, including the nature of the records required to be maintained and produced and the time periods involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has in place procedures to explain the Customs Service requirements to those employees that are involved in the preparation of claims, and the maintenance and production of required records;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) has in place procedures regarding the preparation of claims and maintenance of re<!-- PDFPage:247 -->quired records, and the production of such records to the Customs Service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) has a record maintenance procedure approved by the Customs Service for original records, or, if approved by the Customs Service, for alternate records or recordkeeping formats other than the original records; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) has procedures for notifying the Customs Service of variances to, and violations of, the requirements of the drawback compliance program or any negotiated alternative programs, and for taking corrective action when notified by the Customs Service for violations or problems regarding such program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Alternatives to penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When a party that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has been certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program under subsection (e) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of the program;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">commits a violation of subsection (a) of this section, the Customs Service, shall, in the absence of fraud or repeated violations, and in lieu of a monetary penalty, issue a written notice of the violation to the party. Repeated violations by a party may result in the issuance of penalties and removal of certification under the program until corrective action, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is taken.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A notice of violation issued under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) state that the party has violated subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) explain the nature of the violation; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Response to notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within a reasonable time after receiving written notice under paragraph (1), the party shall notify the Customs Service of the steps it has taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Repetitive violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A party who has been issued a written notice under subsection (f)(1) of this section and subsequently commits a repeat negligent violation involving the same issue is subject to the following monetary penalties:</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of bond by regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which bond or other security is not specifically required by law, the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation or specific instruction require, or authorize customs officers to require, such bonds or other security as he, or they, may deem necessary for the protection of the revenue or to assure compliance with any provision of law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service may be authorized to enforce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions and form of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a bond is required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce, the Secretary of the Treasury may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, prescribe the conditions and form of such bond and the manner in which the bond may be filed with or, pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system, transmitted to the Customs Service, and fix the amount of penalty thereof, whether for the payment of liquidated damages or of a penal sum: <em>Provided</em>, That when a consolidated bond authorized by paragraph 4 of this subsection is taken, the Secretary of the Treasury may fix the penalty of such bond without regard to any other provision of law, regulation, or instruction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Provide for the approval of the sureties on such bond, without regard to any general provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Authorize the execution of a term bond the conditions of which shall extend to and cover similar cases of importations over such period of time, not to exceed one year, or such longer period as he may fix when in his opinion special circumstances existing in a particular instance require such longer period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Authorize, to the extent that he may deem necessary, the taking of a consolidated bond (single entry or term), in lieu of separate bonds to assure compliance with two or more provisions of law, regulations, or instructions which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce. A consolidated bond taken pursuant to the authority contained in this subsection shall have the same force and effect in respect of every provision of law, regulation, or instruction for the purposes for which it is required as though separate bonds had been taken to assure compliance with each such provision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cancellation of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury may authorize the cancellation of any bond provided for in this section, or of any charge that may have been made against such bond, in the event of a breach of any condition of the bond, upon the payment of such lesser amount or penalty or upon such other terms and conditions as he may deem sufficient. In order to assure uniform, reasonable, and equitable decisions, the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish guidelines establishing standards for setting the terms and conditions for cancellation of bonds or charges thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Validity of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No condition in any bond taken to assure compliance with any law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce shall be held invalid on the ground that such condition is not specified in the law, regulation, or instruction authorizing or requiring the taking of such bond. Any bond transmitted to the Customs Service pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system shall have the same force and effect and be binding upon the parties thereto as if such bond were manually executed, signed, and filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit of money or obligation of United States in lieu of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to permit the deposit of money or obligations of the United States, in such amount and upon such conditions as he may by regulation prescribe, in lieu of sureties on any bond required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Unless action has been taken under subparagraph (B), the appropriate customs officer shall serve notice in writing upon any customs broker to show cause why the broker should not be subject to a monetary penalty not to exceed $30,000 in total for a violation or violations of this section. The notice shall advise the customs broker of the allegations or complaints against him and shall explain that the broker has a right to respond to the allegations or complaints in writing within 30 days of the date of the notice. Before imposing a monetary penalty, the customs officer shall consider the allegations or complaints and any timely response made by the customs broker and issue a written decision. A customs broker against whom a monetary penalty has been issued under this section shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. Following the conclusion of any proceeding under section 1618 of this title, the appropriate customs officer shall provide to the customs broker a written statement which sets forth the final determination and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revocation or suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Customs Service may, for good and sufficient reason, serve notice in writing upon any customs broker to show cause why a license or permit issued under this section should not be revoked or suspended. The notice shall be in the form of a statement specifically setting forth the grounds of the complaint, and shall allow the customs broker 30 days to respond. If no response is filed, or the Customs Service determines that the revocation or suspension is still warranted, it shall notify the customs broker in writing of a hearing to be held within 30 days, or at a later date if the broker requests an extension and shows good cause therefor, before an administrative law judge appointed pursuant to section 3105 of title 5 who shall serve as the hearing officer. If the customs broker waives the hearing, or the broker or his designated representative fails to appear at the appointed time and place, the hearing officer shall make findings and recommendations based on the record submitted by the parties. At the hearing, the customs broker may be represented by counsel, and all proceedings, including the proof of the charges and the response thereto shall be presented with testimony taken under oath and the right of cross-examination accorded to both parties. A transcript of the hearing shall be made and a copy will be provided to the Customs Service and the customs broker; which shall thereafter be provided reasonable opportunity to file a post-hearing brief. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit promptly the record of the hearing along with the findings of fact and <!-- PDFPage:275 -->recommendations to the Secretary for decision. The Secretary will issue a written decision, based solely on the record, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for the decision.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Settlement and compromise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may settle and compromise any disciplinary proceeding which has been instituted under this subsection according to the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, including but not limited to the reduction of any proposed suspension or revocation to a monetary penalty.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation of actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1621 of this title, no proceeding under this subsection or subsection (b)(6) of this section shall be commenced unless such proceeding is instituted by the appropriate service of written notice within 5 years from the date the alleged violation was committed; except that if the alleged violation consists of fraud, the 5-year period of limitation shall commence running from the time such alleged violation was discovered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial appeal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A customs broker, applicant, or other person directly affected may appeal any decision of the Secretary denying or revoking a license or permit under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, or revoking or suspending a license or permit or imposing a monetary penalty in lieu thereof under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section, by filing in the Court of International Trade, within 60 days after the issuance of the decision or order, a written petition requesting that the decision or order be modified or set aside in whole or in part.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of objections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall not consider any objection to the decision or order of the Secretary, or to the introduction of evidence or testimony, unless that objection was raised before the hearing officer in suspension or revocation proceedings unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Conclusiveness of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The findings of the Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any party applies to the court for leave to present additional evidence and the court is satisfied that the additional evidence is material and that reasonable grounds existed for the failure to present the evidence in the proceedings before the hearing officer, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the hearing officer and to be presented in a manner and upon the terms and conditions prescribed by the court. The Secretary may modify the findings of facts on the basis of the additional evidence presented. The Secretary shall then file with the court any new or modified findings of fact which shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, together with a recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original decision or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the decision of the Secretary except in the case of a denial of a license or permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Failure to appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an appeal is not filed within the time limits specified in this section, the decision by the Secretary shall be final and conclusive. In the case of a monetary penalty imposed under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section, if the amount is not tendered within 60 days after the decision becomes final, the license shall automatically be suspended until payment is made to the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations by the Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe such rules and regulations relating to the customs business of customs brokers as the Secretary considers necessary to protect importers and the revenue of the United States, and to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules and regulations governing the licensing of or issuance of permits to customs brokers, the keeping of books, accounts, and records by customs brokers, and documents and correspondence, and the furnishing by customs brokers of any other information relating to their customs business to any duly accredited officer or employee of the Customs Service.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1671a. Procedures for initiating a countervailing duty investigation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initiation by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A countervailing duty investigation shall be initiated whenever the administering authority determines, from information available to it, that a formal investigation is warranted into the question of whether the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1671(a) of this title exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation by petition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petition requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A countervailing duty proceeding shall be initiated whenever an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title files a petition with the administering authority, on behalf of an industry, which alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of the duty imposed by section 1671(a) of this title, and which is accompanied by information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting those allegations. The petition may be amended at such time, and upon such conditions, as the administering authority and the Commission may permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Simultaneous filing with Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petitioner shall file a copy of the petition with the Commission on the same day as it is filed with the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Petition based upon a derogation of an international undertaking on official export credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sole basis of a petition filed under paragraph (1) is the derogation of an international undertaking on official export credits, the Administering Authority shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Treasury who shall, in consultation with the Administering Authority, within 5 days after the <!-- PDFPage:288 -->date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under subsection (c) of this section, determine the existence and estimated value of the derogation, if any, and shall publish such determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action with respect to petitions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notification of governments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) notify the government of any exporting country named in the petition by delivering a public version of the petition to an appropriate representative of such country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide the government of any exporting country named in the petition that is a Subsidies Agreement country an opportunity for consultations with respect to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Acceptance of communications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority shall not accept any unsolicited oral or written communication from any person other than an interested party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title before the administering authority makes its decision whether to initiate an investigation, except as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii) and subsection (c)(4)(D) of this section, and except for inquiries regarding the status of the administering authority's consideration of the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Nondisclosure of certain information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority and the Commission shall not disclose information with regard to any draft petition submitted for review and comment before it is filed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petition determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Time for initial determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), within 20 days after the date on which a petition is filed under subsection (b) of this section, the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after examining, on the basis of sources readily available to the administering authority, the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the petition, determine whether the petition alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1671(a) of this title and contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine if the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extension of time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the administering authority is required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the industry under paragraph (4)(D), the administering authority may, in exceptional circumstances, apply subparagraph (A) by substituting &ldquo;a maximum of 40 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;20 days&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Time limits where petition involves same merchandise as an order that has been revoked</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a petition is filed under this section with respect to merchandise that was the subject merchandise of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a countervailing duty order that was revoked under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a suspended investigation that was terminated under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the administering authority and the Commission shall, to the maximum extent practicable, expedite any investigation initiated under this section with respect to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Affirmative determinations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Negative determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination under clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) is negative, the administering authority shall dismiss the petition, terminate the proceeding, and notify the petitioner in writing of the reasons for the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination of industry support</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority shall determine that the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for at least 25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support for or opposition to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain positions disregarded</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Producers related to foreign producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining industry support under subparagraph (A), the administering authority shall disregard the position of domestic producers who oppose the petition, if such producers are related to foreign producers, as defined in section 1677(4)(B)(ii) of this title, unless such domestic producers demonstrate that their interests as domestic producers would be adversely affected by the imposition of a countervailing duty order.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Producers who are importers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The administering authority may disregard the position of domestic producers of a domestic like product who are importers of the subject merchandise.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:289 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for regional industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition alleges that the industry is a regional industry, the administering authority shall determine whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry by applying subparagraph (A) on the basis of production in the region.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Polling the industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition does not establish support of domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if there is support for the petition as required by subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if there is a large number of producers in the industry, the administering authority may determine industry support for the petition by using any statistically valid sampling method to poll the industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Comments by interested parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, any person who would qualify as an interested party under section 1677(9) of this title if an investigation were initiated, may submit comments or information on the issue of industry support. After the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, the determination regarding industry support shall not be reconsidered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Domestic producers or workers&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;domestic producers or workers&rdquo; means those interested parties who are eligible to file a petition under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notification to Commission of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notify the Commission immediately of any determination it makes under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the determination is affirmative, make available to the Commission such information as it may have relating to the matter under investigation, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Information regarding critical circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time after the initiation of an investigation under this part, the administering authority finds a reasonable basis to suspect that the alleged countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, the administering authority may request the Commissioner of Customs to compile information on an expedited basis regarding entries of the subject merchandise. Upon receiving such request, the Commissioner of Customs shall collect information regarding the volume and value of entries of the subject merchandise and shall transmit such information to the administering authority at such times as the administering authority shall direct (at least once every 30 days), until a final determination is made under section 1671d(a) of this title, the investigation is terminated, or the administering authority withdraws the request.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination by Commission of reasonable indication of injury</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of a petition dismissed by the administering authority under section 1671a(c)(3) of this title, the Commission, within the time specified in paragraph (2), shall determine, based on the information available to it at the time of the determination, whether there is a reasonable indication that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible. If the Commission finds that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible or otherwise makes a negative determination under this paragraph, the investigation shall be terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time for Commission determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make the determination described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a petition filed under section 1671a(b) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) within 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the time has been extended pursuant to section 1671a(c)(1)(B) of this title, within 25 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority of initiation of the investigation, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an investigation initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, within 45 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority that an investigation has been initiated under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preliminary determination by administering authority; expedited determinations; waiver of verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, but not before an affirmative determination by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the administering authority shall make a determination, based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the petition is one subject to section 1671a(b)(3) of this title, the Administering Authority shall, taking into account the nature of the countervailable subsidy concerned, make the determination required by paragraph (1) on an expedited basis and within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title unless the provisions of subsection (c) of this section apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 55 days after the initiation of an investigation the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 50 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title. Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made on an expedited basis on the basis of the record established <!-- PDFPage:291 -->during the first 50 days after the investigation was initiated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>De minimis countervailable subsidy.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any de minimis countervailable subsidy. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a countervailable subsidy is de minimis if the administering authority determines that the aggregate of the net countervailable subsidies is less than 1 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exception for developing countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of subject merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country (other than a country to which subparagraph (C) applies) designated by the Trade Representative as a developing country in accordance with section 1677(36) of this title, a countervailable subsidy is de minimis if the administering authority determines that the aggregate of the net countervailable subsidies does not exceed 2 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain other developing countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of subject merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a least developed country, as determined by the Trade Representative in accordance with section 1677(36) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a developing country with respect to which the Trade Representative has notified the administering authority that the country has eliminated its export subsidies on an expedited basis within the meaning of Article 27.11 of the Subsidies Agreement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;2 percent&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on application of subparagraph</cap-smallcap> (C).&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a country described in subparagraph (C)(i), the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall not apply after the date that is 8 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for subparagraph</cap-smallcap> (C)(ii) <cap-smallcap>countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a country described in subparagraph (C)(ii), the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall not apply after the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the date that is 8 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the date on which the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that such country is providing an export subsidy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Notification of article 8 violation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the only subsidy under investigation is a subsidy with respect to which the administering authority received notice from the Trade Representative of a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;60 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;65 days&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of period in extraordinarily complicated cases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the petitioner makes a timely request for an extension of the period within which the determination must be made under subsection (b) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administering authority concludes that the parties concerned are cooperating and determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the number and complexity of the alleged countervailable subsidy practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the novelty of the issues presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the need to determine the extent to which particular countervailable subsidies are used by individual manufacturers, producers, and exporters; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the administering authority may postpone making the preliminary determination under subsection (b) of this section until not later than the 130th day after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of postponement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall notify the parties to the investigation, not later than 20 days before the date on which the preliminary determination would otherwise be required under subsection (b) of this section, if it intends to postpone making the preliminary determination under paragraph (1). The notification shall include an explanation of the reasons for the postponement. Notice of the postponement shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of determination by the administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the preliminary determination of the administering authority under subsection (b) of this section is affirmative, the administering authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) determine an estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate for each exporter and producer individually investigated, and, in accordance with section 1671d(c)(5) of this title, an estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated and for new exporters and producers within the meaning of section 1675(a)(2)(B) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if section 1677f&ndash;1(e)(2)(B) of this title applies, determine a single estimated country-wide subsidy rate, applicable to all exporters and producers, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate, the estimated all-others rate, or the estimated country-wide subsidy rate, whichever is applicable,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of merchandise subject to the de<!-- PDFPage:292 -->termination which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date on which notice of the determination is published in the Federal Register, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall make available to the Commission all information upon which its determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its injury determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The instructions of the administering authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) may not remain in effect for more than 4 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Critical circumstances determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a petitioner alleges critical circumstances in its original petition, or by amendment at any time more than 20 days before the date of a final determination by the administering authority, then the administering authority shall promptly (at any time after the initiation of the investigation under this part) determine, on the basis of the information available to it at that time, whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the alleged countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension of liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority under paragraph (1) is affirmative, then any suspension of liquidation ordered under subsection (d)(2) of this section shall apply, or, if notice of such suspension of liquidation is already published, be amended to apply, to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of&mdash;</p>

The administering authority shall include with such notification the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based. Not later than 5 days after the date on which the determination is required to be made under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Commission shall transmit to the administering authority the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Time period where upstream subsidization is involved</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the administering authority concludes prior to a preliminary determination under subsection (b) of this section, that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy is being bestowed, the time period within which a preliminary determination must be made shall be extended to 250 days after the filing of a petition under section 1671a(b) of this title or initiation of an investigation under section 1671a(a) of this title (310 days in cases declared extraordinarily complicated under subsection (c) of this section), if the administering authority concludes that such additional time is necessary to make the required determination concerning upstream subsidization.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in cases in which the preliminary determination is affirmative, the determination concerning upstream subsidization&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior consultations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Final determination by administering authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 75 days after the date of the preliminary determination under section 1671b(b) of this title, the administering authority shall make a final determination of whether or not <!-- PDFPage:299 -->a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise; except that when an investigation under this part is initiated simultaneously with an investigation under part II of this subtitle, which involves imports of the same class or kind of merchandise from the same or other countries, the administering authority, if requested by the petitioner, shall extend the date of the final determination under this paragraph to the date of the final determination of the administering authority in such investigation initiated under part II of this subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Critical circumstances determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under section 1671b(e) of this title, shall also contain a finding as to whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such findings may be affirmative even though the preliminary determination under section 1671b(e)(1) of this title was negative.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) De minimis countervailable subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any countervailable subsidy that is de minimis as defined in section 1671b(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Final determination by Commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make a final determination of whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) of this section. If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title is affirmative, then the Commission shall make the determination required by paragraph (1) before the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the 120th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative preliminary determination under section 1671b(b) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the 45th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative final determination under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Period for injury determination following negative preliminary determination by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title is negative, and its final determination under subsection (a) of this section is affirmative, then the final determination by the Commission under this subsection shall be made within 75 days after the date of that affirmative final determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the finding of the administering authority under subsection (a)(2) of this section is affirmative, then the final determination of the Commission shall include a finding as to whether the imports subject to the affirmative determination under subsection (a)(2) of this section are likely to undermine seriously the remedial effect of the countervailing duty order to be issued under section 1671e of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Factors to consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making the evaluation under clause (i), the Commission shall consider, among other factors it considers relevant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the timing and the volume of the imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) any rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the countervailing duty order will be seriously undermined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) of this section would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of that merchandise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) determine an estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate for each exporter and producer individually inves<!-- PDFPage:300 -->tigated, and, in accordance with paragraph (5), an estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated and for new exporters and producers within the meaning of section 1675(a)(2)(B) of this title, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title was negative, the administering authority shall order the suspension of liquidation under paragraph (2) of section 1671b(d) of this title.</p>

If either of such determinations is negative, the investigation shall be terminated upon the publication of notice of that negative determination and the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect of affirmative determination under subsection (a)(2) of this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority under subsection (a)(2) of this section is affirmative, then the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title was affirmative, but the preliminary determination under section 1671b(e)(1) of this title was negative, shall modify any suspension of liquidation and security requirement previously ordered under section 1671b(d) of this title to apply to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days before the date on which suspension of liquidation was first ordered; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Method for determining the all-others rate and the country-wide subsidy rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) All-others rate</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subsection and section 1671b(d) of this title, the all-others rate shall be an amount equal to the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated, excluding any zero and de minimis countervailable subsidy rates, and any rates determined entirely under section 1677e of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the countervailable subsidy rates established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis rates, or are determined entirely under section 1677e of this title, the administering authority may use any reasonable method to establish an all-others rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated, including averaging the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates determined for the exporters and producers individually investigated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Country-wide subsidy rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority may calculate a single country-wide subsidy rate, applicable to all exporters and producers, if the administering authority limits its examination pursuant to section 1677f&ndash;1(e)(2)(B) of this title. The estimated country-wide rate determined under section 1671b(d)(1)(A)(ii) of this title or paragraph (1)(B)(i)(II) of this subsection shall be based on industry-wide data regarding the use of subsidies determined to be countervailable.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:301 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Publication of notice of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the administering authority or the Commission makes a determination under this section, it shall notify the petitioner, other parties to the investigation, and the other agency of its determination and of the facts and conclusions of law upon which the determination is based, and it shall publish notice of its determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Correction of ministerial errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) directs customs officers to assess a countervailing duty equal to the amount of the net countervailable subsidy determined or estimated to exist, within 6 months after the date <!-- PDFPage:302 -->on which the administering authority receives satisfactory information upon which the assessment may be based, but in no event later than 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which the merchandise is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1673a. Procedures for initiating an antidumping duty investigation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initiation by administering authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An antidumping duty investigation shall be initiated whenever the administering authority determines, from information available to it, that a formal investigation is warranted into the question of whether the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1673 of this title exist.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cases involving persistent dumping</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority may establish a monitoring program with respect to imports of a class or kind of merchandise from any additional supplier country for a period not to exceed one year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) more than one antidumping order is in effect with respect to that class or kind of merchandise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the judgment of the administering authority there is reason to believe or suspect an extraordinary pattern of persistent injurious dumping from one or more additional supplier countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the judgment of the administering authority this extraordinary pattern is causing a serious commercial problem for the domestic industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Initiation of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If during the period of monitoring referred to in subparagraph (A), the administering authority determines that there is sufficient information to initiate a formal investigation under this subsection regarding an additional supplier country, the administering authority shall immediately initiate such an investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;additional supplier country&rdquo; means a country regarding which no antidumping investigation is currently pending, and no antidumping duty order is currently in effect, with respect to imports of the class or kind of merchandise covered by subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Expeditious action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority and the Commission, to the extent practicable, shall expedite proceedings under this part undertaken as a result of a formal investigation initiated under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation by petition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petition requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An antidumping proceeding shall be initiated whenever an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of sec<!-- PDFPage:305 -->tion 1677(9) of this title files a petition with the administering authority, on behalf of an industry, which alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of the duty imposed by section 1673 of this title, and which is accompanied by information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting those allegations. The petition may be amended at such time, and upon such conditions, as the administering authority and the Commission may permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Simultaneous filing with Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petitioner shall file a copy of the petition with the Commission on the same day as it is filed with the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Action with respect to petitions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notification of governments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall notify the government of any exporting country named in the petition by delivering a public version of the petition to an appropriate representative of such country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Acceptance of communications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority shall not accept any unsolicited oral or written communication from any person other than an interested party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title before the administering authority makes its decision whether to initiate an investigation, except as provided in subsection (c)(4)(D) of this section, and except for inquiries regarding the status of the administering authority's consideration of the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Nondisclosure of certain information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority and the Commission shall not disclose information with regard to any draft petition submitted for review and comment before it is filed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petition determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Time for initial determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), within 20 days after the date on which a petition is filed under subsection (b) of this section, the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after examining, on the basis of sources readily available to the administering authority, the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the petition, determine whether the petition alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 1673 of this title and contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine if the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extension of time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the administering authority is required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the industry under paragraph (4)(D), the administering authority may, in exceptional circumstances, apply subparagraph (A) by substituting &ldquo;a maximum of 40 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;20 days&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Time limits where petition involves same merchandise as an order that has been revoked</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a petition is filed under this section with respect to merchandise that was the subject merchandise of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an antidumping duty order or finding that was revoked under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a suspended investigation that was terminated under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the administering authority and the Commission shall, to the maximum extent practicable, expedite any investigation initiated under this section with respect to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Affirmative determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determinations under clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) are affirmative, the administering authority shall initiate an investigation to determine whether the subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Negative determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination under clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) is negative, the administering authority shall dismiss the petition, terminate the proceeding, and notify the petitioner in writing of the reasons for the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination of industry support</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority shall determine that the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for at least 25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support for or opposition to the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain positions disregarded</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Producers related to foreign producers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining industry support under subparagraph (A), the administering authority shall disregard the position of domestic producers who oppose the petition, if such producers are related to foreign producers, as defined in section 1677(4)(B)(ii) of this title, unless such domestic producers demonstrate that their interests as domestic producers would be adversely affected by the imposition of an antidumping duty order.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Producers who are importers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The administering authority may disregard the position of domestic producers <!-- PDFPage:306 -->of a domestic like product who are importers of the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for regional industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition alleges the industry is a regional industry, the administering authority shall determine whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry by applying subparagraph (A) on the basis of production in the region.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Polling the industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petition does not establish support of domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if there is support for the petition as required by subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if there is a large number of producers in the industry, the administering authority may determine industry support for the petition by using any statistically valid sampling method to poll the industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Comments by interested parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, any person who would qualify as an interested party under section 1677(9) of this title if an investigation were initiated, may submit comments or information on the issue of industry support. After the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, the determination regarding industry support shall not be reconsidered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Domestic producers or workers&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;domestic producers or workers&rdquo; means those interested parties who are eligible to file a petition under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notification to Commission of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notify the Commission immediately of any determination it makes under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the determination is affirmative, make available to the Commission such information as it may have relating to the matter under investigation, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Information regarding critical circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time after the initiation of an investigation under this part, the administering authority finds a reasonable basis to suspect that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew, or should have known, that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the administering authority may request the Commissioner of Customs to compile information on an expedited basis regarding entries of the subject merchandise. Upon receiving such request, the Commissioner of Customs shall collect information regarding the volume and value of entries of the subject merchandise and shall transmit such information to the administering authority at such times as the administering authority shall direct (at least once every 30 days), until a final determination is made under section 1673d(a) of this title, the investigation is terminated, or the administering authority withdraws the request.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination by Commission of reasonable indication of injury</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of a petition dismissed by the administering authority under section 1673a(c)(3) of this title, the Commission, within the time specified in paragraph (2), shall determine, based on the information available to it at the time of the determination, whether there is a reasonable indication that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible. If the Commission finds that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible or otherwise makes a negative determination under this paragraph, the investigation shall be terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time for Commission determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make the determination described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a petition filed under section 1673a(b) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) within 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the time has been extended pursuant to section 1673a(c)(1)(B) of this title, within 25 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority of initiation of the investigation, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an investigation initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title, within 45 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority that an investigation has been initiated under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preliminary determination by administering authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Period of antidumping duty investigation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), within 140 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1673a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title, but not before an affirmative determination by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the administering authority shall make a determination, based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold, or is likely to be sold, at less than fair value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) If certain short life cycle merchandise involved</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a petition filed under section 1673a(b) of this title, or an investigation initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title, concerns short life cycle merchandise that is included in a product category established under section 1673h(a) of this title, subparagraph (A) shall be applied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by substituting &ldquo;100 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;140 days&rdquo; if manufacturers that are second offenders account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:308 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by substituting &ldquo;80 days&rdquo; for &ldquo;140 days&rdquo; if manufacturers that are multiple offenders account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definitions of offenders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The term &ldquo;second offender&rdquo; means a manufacturer that is specified in 2 affirmative dumping determinations (within the meaning of section 1673h of this title) as the manufacturer of short life cycle merchandise that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) specified in both such determinations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) within the scope of the product category referred to in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The term &ldquo;multiple offender&rdquo; means a manufacturer that is specified in 3 or more affirmative dumping determinations (within the meaning of section 1673h of this title) as the manufacturer of short life cycle merchandise that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) specified in each of such determinations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) within the scope of the product category referred to in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preliminary determination under waiver of verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 75 days after the initiation of an investigation, the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 60 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title. Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a preliminary determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made within 90 days after the initiation of the investigation on the basis of the record established during the first 60 days after the investigation was initiated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) De minimis dumping margin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any weighted average dumping margin that is de minimis. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a weighted average dumping margin is de minimis if the administering authority determines that it is less than 2 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of period in extraordinarily complicated cases</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the petitioner makes a timely request for an extension of the period within which the determination must be made under subsection (b)(1) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administering authority concludes that the parties concerned are cooperating and determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated or adjustments to be considered,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the novelty of the issues presented, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the administering authority may postpone making the preliminary determination under subsection (b)(1) of this section until not later than the 190th day after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1673a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1673a(a) of this title. No extension of a determination date may be made under this paragraph for any investigation in which a determination date provided for in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section applies unless the petitioner submits written notice to the administering authority of its consent to the extension.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of postponement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall notify the parties to the investigation, not later than 20 days before the date on which the preliminary determination would otherwise be required under subsection (b)(1) of this section, if it intends to postpone making the preliminary determination under paragraph (1). The notification shall include an explanation of the reasons for the postponement, and notice of the postponement shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of determination by the administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the preliminary determination of the administering authority under subsection (b) of this section is affirmative, the administering authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) determine an estimated weighted average dumping margin for each exporter and producer individually investigated, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:309 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) determine, in accordance with section 1673d(c)(5) of this title, an estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated weighted average dumping margin or the estimated all-others rate, whichever is applicable,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of merchandise subject to the determination which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date on which notice of the determination is published in the Federal Register, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date that is 60 days after the date on which notice of the determination to initiate the investigation is published in the Federal Register, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall make available to the Commission all information upon which such determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its injury determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The instructions of the administering authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) may not remain in effect for more than 4 months, except that the administering authority may, at the request of exporters representing a significant proportion of exports of the subject merchandise, extend that 4-month period to not more than 6 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Critical circumstances determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a petitioner alleges critical circumstances in its original petition, or by amendment at any time more than 20 days before the date of a final determination by the administering authority, then the administering authority shall promptly (at any time after the initiation of the investigation under this part) determine, on the basis of the information available to it at that time, whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there was likely to be material injury by reason of such sales, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The administering authority shall be treated as having made an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A) in any investigation to which subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section is applied.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension of liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority under paragraph (1) is affirmative, then any suspension of liquidation ordered under subsection (d)(2) of this section shall apply, or, if notice of such suspension of liquidation is already published, be amended to apply, to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date which is 90 days before the date on which the suspension of liquidation was first ordered, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date on which notice of the determination to initiate the investigation is published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notice of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission or the administering authority makes a determination under this section, the Commission or the administering authority, as the case may be, shall notify the petitioner, and other parties to the investigation, and the Commission or the administering authority (whichever is appropriate) of its determination. The administering authority shall include with such notification the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based. Not later than 5 days after the date on which the determination is required to be made under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Commission shall transmit to the administering authority the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the administering authority may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) by accepting an understanding or other kind of agreement to limit the volume of imports into the United States of the subject merchandise unless the administering authority is satisfied that termination on the basis of that agreement is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Public interest factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest the administering authority shall take into account&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior consultations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreements eliminating injurious effect</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority determines that extraordinary circumstances are present in a case, it may suspend an investigation upon the acceptance of an agreement to revise prices from exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all of the imports of that merchandise into the United States, if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of exports to the United States of that merchandise and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of that merchandise will be prevented, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for each entry of each exporter the amount by which the estimated normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) will not exceed 15 percent of the weighted average amount by which the estimated normal value exceeded the export price (or the constructed export price) for all less-than-fair-value entries of the exporter examined during the course of the investigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the investigation is complex.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Complex&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;complex&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Final determination by administering authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 75 days after the date of its preliminary determination under section 1673b(b) of this title, the administering authority shall make a final determination of whether the subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Extension of period for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority may postpone making the final determination under paragraph (1) until not later than the 135th day after the date on which it published notice of its preliminary determination under section 1673b(b) of this title if a request in writing for such a postponement is made by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) exporters who account for a significant proportion of exports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation, in a proceeding in which the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was affirmative, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the petitioner, in a proceeding in which the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Critical circumstances determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under section 1673b(e) of this title, shall also contain a finding of whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there would be material injury by reason of such sales, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such findings may be affirmative even though the preliminary determination under section 1673b(e)(1) of this title was negative.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) De minimis dumping margin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any weighted average dumping margin that is de minimis as defined in section 1673b(b)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Final determination by Commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make a final determination of whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an industry in the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is materially injured, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is threatened with material injury, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a)(1) of this section. If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title is affirmative, then the Commission shall make the determination required by paragraph (1) before the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the 120th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative preliminary determination under section 1673b(b) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the 45th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative final determination under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Period for injury determination following negative preliminary determination by administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title is negative, and its final determination under subsection (a) of this section is affirmative, then the final determination by the Commission under this subsection shall be made within 75 days after the date of that affirmative final determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certain additional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Commission standard for retroactive application.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the finding of the administering authority under subsection <!-- PDFPage:316 -->(a)(3) of this section is affirmative, then the final determination of the Commission shall include a finding as to whether the imports subject to the affirmative determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section are likely to undermine seriously the remedial effect of the antidumping duty order to be issued under section 1673e of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Factors to consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making the evaluation under clause (i), the Commission shall consider, among other factors it considers relevant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the timing and the volume of the imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the antidumping order will be seriously undermined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of the imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) of this section would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effect of final determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Effect of affirmative determination by the administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority under subsection (a) of this section is affirmative, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the administering authority shall make available to the Commission all information upon which such determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information as to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) determine the estimated weighted average dumping margin for each exporter and producer individually investigated, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) determine, in accordance with paragraph (5), the estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the administering authority shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated weighted average dumping margin or the estimated all-others rate, whichever is applicable, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative, the administering authority shall order the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Issuance of order; effect of negative determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determinations of the administering authority and the Commission under subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section are affirmative, then the administering authority shall issue an antidumping duty order under section 1673e(a) of this title. If either of such determinations is negative, the investigation shall be terminated upon the publication of notice of that negative determination and the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) terminate the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit, required under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of negative determinations under subsections (a)(3) and (b)(4)(A) of this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority or the Commission under subsection (a)(3) or (b)(4)(A) of this section, respectively, is negative, then the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) terminate any retroactive suspension of liquidation required under paragraph (4) or section 1673b(e)(2) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit required, under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title with respect to entries of the merchandise the liquidation of which was suspended retroactively under section 1673b(e)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect of affirmative determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination of the administering authority under subsection (a)(3) of this section is affirmative, then the administering authority shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in cases where the preliminary determinations by the administering authority under sections 1673b(b) and 1673b(e)(1) of this title were both affirmative, continue the retroactive suspension of liquidation and the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security previously ordered under section 1673b(e)(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was affirmative, but the preliminary determination under section 1673b(e)(1) of this title was negative, shall modify any suspension of liquidation and security requirement previously ordered under section 1673b(d) of this title to apply to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days before the date on which suspension of liquidation was first ordered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative, shall apply any suspension of liquida<!-- PDFPage:317 -->tion and security requirement ordered under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days before the date on which suspension of liquidation is first ordered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Method for determining estimated all-others rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection and section 1673b(d) of this title, the estimated all-others rate shall be an amount equal to the weighted average of the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for exporters and producers individually investigated, excluding any zero and de minimis margins, and any margins determined entirely under section 1677e of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis margins, or are determined entirely under section 1677e of this title, the administering authority may use any reasonable method to establish the estimated all-others rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated, including averaging the estimated weighted average dumping margins determined for the exporters and producers individually investigated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Publication of notice of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the administering authority or the Commission makes a determination under this section, it shall notify the petitioner, other parties to the investigation, and the other agency of its determination and of the facts and conclusions of law upon which the determination is based, and it shall publish notice of its determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Correction of ministerial errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;ministerial error&rdquo; includes errors in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the administering authority orders any liquidation of entries pursuant to a review under paragraph (1), such liquidation shall be made promptly and, to the greatest extent practicable, within 90 days after the instructions to Customs are issued.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In a review in which an interested party waives its participation pursuant to this paragraph, the administering authority shall conclude that revocation of the order or termination of the investigation would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) with respect to that interested party.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Sequence of transition reviews</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority, in consultation with the Commission, shall determine such sequence of review of transition orders as it deems appropriate to promote administrative efficiency. To the extent practicable, older orders shall be reviewed first.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, a transition order shall be treated as issued on the date the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, if such order is based on an investigation conducted by both the administering authority and the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Exclusions from computations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), there shall be excluded from the computation of the 5-year period described in paragraph (1) and the periods described in paragraph (6) any period during which the importation of the subject merchandise is prohibited on account of the imposition, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act [50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] or other provision of law, of sanctions by the United States against the country in which the subject merchandise originates.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of exclusion</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority may revoke, in whole or in part, a countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, after review under subsection (a) or (b) of this section. The administering authority shall not revoke, in whole or in part, a countervailing duty order or terminate a suspended investigation on the basis of any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of the subject merchandise to the United States which are specifically intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Five-year reviews</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a review conducted under subsection (c) of this section, the administering authority shall revoke a countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Commission makes a determination that material injury would be likely to continue or recur as described in section 1675a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of revocation or termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A determination under this section to revoke an order or finding or terminate a suspended investigation shall apply with respect to unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date determined by the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hearings</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Determination that basis for suspension no longer exists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the determination of the Commission under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section is negative, the suspension agreement shall be treated as not accepted, beginning on the date of publication of the Commission's determination, and the administering authority and the Commission shall proceed, under section 1671c(i) or 1673c(i) of this title, as if the suspension agreement had been violated on that date, except that no duty under any order subsequently issued shall be assessed on merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reviews to implement results of subsidies enforcement proceeding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Violations of article 8 of the subsidies agreement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administering authority has reason to believe that merchandise subject to an existing countervailing duty order or suspended investigation is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) no review pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section is in progress,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the administering authority shall conduct a review of the order or suspended investigation to determine whether the subject merchandise benefits from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement. If the administering authority determines that the subject merchandise is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program, it shall make appropriate adjustments in the estimated duty to be deposited or appropriate revisions to the terms of the suspension agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withdrawal of subsidy or imposition of countermeasures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that, pursuant to Article 4 or Article 7 of the Subsidies Agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the United States has imposed countermeasures, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such countermeasures are based on the effects in the United States of imports of merchandise that is the subject of a countervailing duty order, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a WTO member country has withdrawn a countervailable subsidy provided with respect to merchandise subject to a countervailing duty order,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the administering authority shall conduct a review to determine if the amount of the estimated duty to be deposited should be adjusted or the order should be revoked.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Expedited review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall conduct reviews under this subsection on an expedited basis, and shall publish the results of such reviews in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Correction of ministerial errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1675a. Special rules for section 1675(b) and 1675(c) reviews</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of material injury</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review conducted under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission shall determine whether revocation of an order, or termination of a suspended investigation, would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time. The Commission shall consider the likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The Commission shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) its prior injury determinations, including the volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry before the order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether any improvement in the state of the industry is related to the order or the suspension agreement,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the industry is vulnerable to material injury if the order is revoked or the suspension agreement is terminated, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in an antidumping proceeding under section 1675(c) of this title, the findings of the administering authority regarding duty absorption under section 1675(a)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Volume</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be significant if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States. In so doing, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any likely increase in production capacity or existing unused production capacity in the exporting country,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) existing inventories of the subject merchandise, or likely increases in inventories,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the existence of barriers to the importation of such merchandise into countries other than the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely price effects of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is likely to be significant price underselling by imports of the subject merchandise as compared to domestic like products, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) imports of the subject merchandise are likely to enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of domestic like products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Impact on the industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In evaluating the likely impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the <!-- PDFPage:329 -->order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) likely declines in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization of capacity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) likely negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) likely negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this paragraph within the context of the business cycle and the conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under this subsection shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the Commission's determination of whether material injury is likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. In making that determination, the Commission shall consider that the effects of revocation or termination may not be imminent, but may manifest themselves only over a longer period of time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Magnitude of margin of dumping and net countervailable subsidy; nature of countervailable subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission may consider the magnitude of the margin of dumping or the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy. If a countervailable subsidy is involved the Commission shall consider information regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Cumulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which reviews under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title were initiated on the same day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market. The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effects of imports of the subject merchandise in a case in which it determines that such imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special rule for regional industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title involving a regional industry, the Commission may base its determination on the regional industry defined in the original investigation under this subtitle, another region that satisfies the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title, or the United States as a whole. In determining if a regional industry analysis is appropriate for the determination in the review, the Commission shall consider whether the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title are likely to be satisfied if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title, the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1671c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy. The administering authority shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the net countervailable subsidy determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether any change in the program which gave rise to the net countervailable subsidy described in subparagraph (A) has occurred that is likely to affect that net countervailable subsidy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) programs determined to provide countervailable subsidies in other investigations or reviews under this subtitle, but only to the extent that such programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) can potentially be used by the exporters or producers subject to the review under section 1675(c) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) did not exist at the time that the countervailing duty order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) programs newly alleged to provide countervailable subsidies but only to the extent that the administering authority makes an affirmative countervailing duty determination with respect to such programs and with respect to the exporters or producers subject to the review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Net countervailable subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under section 1671d of this title or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Treatment of zero and de minimis rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A net countervailable subsidy described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering <!-- PDFPage:330 -->authority to determine that revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of de minimis standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the administering authority shall apply the de minimis standards applicable to reviews conducted under subsections (a) and (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title, the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of an antidumping duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1673c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of sales of the subject merchandise at less than fair value.

Upon receipt of such request, the administering authority, after consulting with the Commission, shall initiate a review of the order under section 1675(c) of this title. The Commission shall combine such review with the investigation under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the administering authority determines that the interested party who requested an investigation under this section is a related party or an importer within the meaning of section 1677(4)(B) of this title, the administering authority may decline a request by such party to initiate a review of an order under section 1675(c) of this title which involves the same or comparable subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cumulation</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Consistent with the rights of the United States under the World Trade Organization, injurious dumping is to be condemned and actionable subsidies which cause injury to domestic industries must be effectively neutralized.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) United States unfair trade laws have as their purpose the restoration of conditions of fair trade so that jobs and investment that should be in the United States are not lost through the false market signals.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The continued dumping or subsidization of imported products after the issuance of antidumping orders or findings or countervailing duty orders can frustrate the remedial purpose of the laws by preventing market prices from returning to fair levels.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Where dumping or subsidization continues, domestic producers will be reluctant to reinvest or rehire and may be unable to maintain pension and health care benefits that conditions of fair trade would permit. Similarly, small businesses and American farmers and ranchers may be unable to pay down accumulated debt, to obtain working capital, or to otherwise remain viable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Administering authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;administering authority&rdquo; means the Secretary of Commerce, or any other officer of the United States to whom the responsibility for carrying out the duties of the administering authority under this subtitle are transferred by law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; means the United States International Trade Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;country&rdquo; means a foreign country, a political subdivision, dependent territory, or possession of a foreign country, and, except for the purpose of antidumping proceedings, may include an association of 2 or more foreign countries, political subdivisions, dependent territories, or possessions of countries into a customs union outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Industry</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;industry&rdquo; means the producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Related parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If a producer of a domestic like product and an exporter or importer of the subject merchandise are related parties, or if a producer of the domestic like product is also an importer of the subject merchandise, the producer may, in appropriate circumstances, be excluded from the industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), a producer and an exporter or importer shall be considered to be related parties, if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:336 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the producer directly or indirectly controls the exporter or importer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the exporter or importer directly or indirectly controls the producer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a third party directly or indirectly controls the producer and the exporter or importer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) the producer and the exporter or importer directly or indirectly control a third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the producer to act differently than a nonrelated producer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, a party shall be considered to directly or indirectly control another party if the party is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Regional industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In appropriate circumstances, the United States, for a particular product market, may be divided into 2 or more markets and the producers within each market may be treated as if they were a separate industry if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the producers within such market sell all or almost all of their production of the domestic like product in question in that market, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the demand in that market is not supplied, to any substantial degree, by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In such appropriate circumstances, material injury, the threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry may be found to exist with respect to an industry even if the domestic industry as a whole, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of that product, is not injured, if there is a concentration of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy into such an isolated market and if the producers of all, or almost all, of the production within that market are being materially injured or threatened by material injury, or if the establishment of an industry is being materially retarded, by reason of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy. The term &ldquo;regional industry&rdquo; means the domestic producers within a region who are treated as a separate industry under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Product lines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The effect of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed in relation to the United States production of a domestic like product if available data permit the separate identification of production in terms of such criteria as the production process or the producer's profits. If the domestic production of the domestic like product has no separate identity in terms of such criteria, then the effect of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes a domestic like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Industry producing processed agricultural products</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (v), in an investigation involving a processed agricultural product produced from any raw agricultural product, the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product may be considered part of the industry producing the processed product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the processed agricultural product is produced from the raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) there is a substantial coincidence of economic interest between the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product and the processors of the processed agricultural product based upon relevant economic factors, which may, in the discretion of the Commission, include price, added market value, or other economic interrelationships (regardless of whether such coincidence of economic interest is based upon any legal relationship).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the processed agricultural product shall be considered to be processed from a raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the raw agricultural product is substantially or completely devoted to the production of the processed agricultural product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the processed agricultural product is produced substantially or completely from the raw product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Relevant economic factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i)(II), in addition to such other factors it considers relevant to the question of coincidence of economic interest, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if price is taken into account, consider the degree of correlation between the price of the raw agricultural product and the price of the processed agricultural product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if added market value is taken into account, consider whether the value of the raw agricultural product constitutes a significant percentage of the value of the processed agricultural product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Raw agricultural product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;raw agricultural product&rdquo; means any farm or fishery product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Termination of this subparagraph</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall cease to have effect if the United States Trade Representative notifies the administering authority <!-- PDFPage:337 -->and the Commission that the application of this subparagraph is inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Countervailable subsidy</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (5B), a countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in this paragraph which is specific as described in paragraph (5A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subsidy described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A subsidy is described in this paragraph in the case in which an authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provides a financial contribution,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides any form of income or price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) makes a payment to a funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution, or entrusts or directs a private entity to make a financial contribution, if providing the contribution would normally be vested in the government and the practice does not differ in substance from practices normally followed by governments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">to a person and a benefit is thereby conferred. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (5A) and (5B), the term &ldquo;authority&rdquo; means a government of a country or any public entity within the territory of the country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination of whether a subsidy exists shall be made without regard to whether the recipient of the subsidy is publicly or privately owned and without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly or indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of merchandise. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining whether a subsidy exists under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Financial contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;financial contribution&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the direct transfer of funds, such as grants, loans, and equity infusions, or the potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities, such as loan guarantees,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) foregoing or not collecting revenue that is otherwise due, such as granting tax credits or deductions from taxable income,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) providing goods or services, other than general infrastructure, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) purchasing goods.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Benefit conferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A benefit shall normally be treated as conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of an equity infusion, if the investment decision is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors, including the practice regarding the provision of risk capital, in the country in which the equity infusion is made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a loan, if there is a difference between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on the market,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of a loan guarantee, if there is a difference, after adjusting for any difference in guarantee fees, between the amount the recipient of the guarantee pays on the guaranteed loan and the amount the recipient would pay for a comparable commercial loan if there were no guarantee by the authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in the case where goods or services are provided, if such goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration, and in the case where goods are purchased, if such goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clause (iv), the adequacy of remuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions for the good or service being provided or the goods being purchased in the country which is subject to the investigation or review. Prevailing market conditions include price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and other conditions of purchase or sale.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Change in ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable, even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm's length transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5A) Specificity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A subsidy is specific if it is an export subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or an import substitution subsidy described in subparagraph (C), or if it is determined to be specific pursuant to subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Export subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An export subsidy is a subsidy that is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Import substitution subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An import substitution subsidy is a subsidy that is contingent upon the use of domestic goods over imported goods, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Domestic subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether a subsidy (other than a subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or (C)) is a specific subsidy, in law or in fact, to an enterprise or industry within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the following guidelines shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, expressly limits access to the subsidy to an enter<!-- PDFPage:338 -->prise or industry, the subsidy is specific as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, the subsidy is not specific as a matter of law, if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Volume</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In evaluating the volume of imports of merchandise, the Commission shall consider whether the volume of imports of the merchandise, or any increase in that volume, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, is significant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the production of the domestic like product sold in the merchant market is not generally used in the production of that downstream article,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;then the Commission, in determining market share and the factors affecting financial performance set forth in clause (iii), shall focus primarily on the merchant market for the domestic like product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rules for agricultural products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The Commission shall not determine that there is no material injury or threat of material injury to United States producers of an agricultural commodity merely because the prevailing market price is at or above the minimum support price.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) in any investigation under this subtitle which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(E)(iv)) and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 1671d(b)(1) or 1673d(b)(1) of this title with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both),</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall consider the factors set forth in clause (i) as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this subtitle. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under clause (i) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Effect of dumping in third-country markets</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In investigations under part II of this subtitle, the Commission shall consider whether dumping in the markets of foreign countries (as evidenced by dumping findings or antidumping remedies in other WTO member markets against the same class or kind of merchandise manufactured or exported by the same party as under investigation) suggests a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. In the course of its investigation, the Commission shall request information from the foreign manufacturer, exporter, or United States importer concerning this issue.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the administering authority shall decide that a competitive benefit has been bestowed when the price for the input product referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section for such use is lower than the price that the manufacturer or producer of merchandise which is the subject of a countervailing duty proceeding would otherwise pay for the product in obtaining it from another seller in an arms-length transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority has determined in a previous proceeding that a countervailable subsidy is paid or bestowed on the input product that is used for comparison under paragraph (1), the administering authority may (A) where appropriate, adjust the <!-- PDFPage:351 -->price that the manufacturer or producer of merchandise which is the subject of such proceeding would otherwise pay for the product to reflect the effects of the countervailable subsidy, or (B) select in lieu of that price a price from another source.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Inclusion of amount of countervailable subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the administering authority decides, during the course of a countervailing duty proceeding that an upstream countervailable subsidy is being or has been paid or bestowed regarding the subject merchandise, the administering authority shall include in the amount of any countervailing duty imposed on the merchandise an amount equal to the amount of the competitive benefit referred to in subparagraph (1)(B),<sup><a href="#1677-1_1_target" name="1677-1_1">1</a></sup> except that in no event shall the amount be greater than the amount of the countervailable subsidy determined with respect to the upstream product.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining under this subtitle whether subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value, a fair comparison shall be made between the export price or constructed export price and normal value. In order to achieve a fair comparison with the export price or constructed export price, normal value shall be determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of normal value</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The normal value of the subject merchandise shall be the price described in subparagraph (B), at a time reasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to determine the export price or constructed export price under section 1677a(a) or (b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The price referred to in subparagraph (A) is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the price at which the foreign like product is first sold (or, in the absence of a sale, offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in a case to which subparagraph (C) applies, the price at which the foreign like product is so sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in a country other than the exporting country or the United States, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such price is representative,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold by the exporter or producer in such other country is 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or value) of the subject merchandise sold in the United States or for export to the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the administering authority does not determine that the particular market situation in such other country prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Third country sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This subparagraph applies when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the foreign like product is not sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country as described in subparagraph (B)(i),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the administering authority determines that the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country is insufficient to permit a proper comparison with the sales of the subject merchandise to the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the particular market situation in the exporting country does not permit a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clause (ii), the aggregate quantity (or value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country shall normally be considered to be insufficient if such quantity (or value) is less than 5 percent of the aggregate quantity (or value) of sales of the subject merchandise to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fictitious markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No pretended sale or offer for sale, and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish a fictitious market, shall be taken into account in determining normal value. The occurrence of different movements in the prices at which different forms of the foreign like product are sold (or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale) in the exporting country after the issuance of an antidumping duty order may be <!-- PDFPage:354 -->considered by the administering authority as evidence of the establishment of a fictitious market for the foreign like product if the movement in such prices appears to reduce the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exportation from an intermediate country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the subject merchandise is exported to the United States from an intermediate country, normal value shall be determined in the intermediate country, except that normal value may be determined in the country of origin of the subject merchandise if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the producer knew at the time of the sale that the subject merchandise was destined for exportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the subject merchandise is merely transshipped through the intermediate country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sales of the foreign like product in the intermediate country do not satisfy the conditions of paragraph (1)(C); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the foreign like product is not produced in the intermediate country.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of constructed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority determines that the normal value of the subject merchandise cannot be determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i), then, notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the normal value of the subject merchandise may be the constructed value of that merchandise, as determined under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Indirect sales or offers for sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the foreign like product is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale through an affiliated party, the prices at which the foreign like product is sold (or offered for sale) by such affiliated party may be used in determining normal value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increased by the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) when included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount, if any, included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), attributable to any additional costs, charges, and expenses incident to bringing the foreign like product from the original place of shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amount of any taxes imposed directly upon the foreign like product or components thereof which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, on the subject merchandise, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of the foreign like product, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increased or decreased by the amount of any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise provided under this section) that is established to the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or partly due to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the fact that the quantities in which the subject merchandise is sold or agreed to be sold to the United States are greater than or less than the quantities in which the foreign like product is sold, agreed to be sold, or offered for sale,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fact that merchandise described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 1677(16) of this title is used in determining normal value, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) other differences in the circumstances of sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Additional adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Level of trade</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall also be increased or decreased to make due allowance for any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise made under this section) that is shown to be wholly or partly due to a difference in level of trade between the export price or constructed export price and normal value, if the difference in level of trade&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) involves the performance of different selling activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In a case described in the preceding sentence, the amount of the adjustment shall be based on the price differences between the two levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Constructed export price offset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">When normal value is established at a level of trade which constitutes a more advanced stage of distribution than the level of trade of the constructed export price, but the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine under subparagraph (A)(ii) a level of trade adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under section 1677a(d)(1)(D) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Adjustments to constructed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Constructed value as determined under subsection (e) of this section, may be adjusted, as appropriate, pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:355 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sales at less than cost of production</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination; sales disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of that product, the administering authority shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of production. If the administering authority determines that sales made at less than the cost of production&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have been made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) were not at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such sales may be disregarded in the determination of normal value. Whenever such sales are disregarded, normal value shall be based on the remaining sales of the foreign like product in the ordinary course of trade. If no sales made in the ordinary course of trade remain, the normal value shall be based on the constructed value of the merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reasonable grounds to believe or suspect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There are reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product were made at prices that are less than the cost of production of the product, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in an investigation initiated under section 1673a of this title or a review conducted under section 1675 of this title, an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title provides information, based upon observed prices or constructed prices or costs, that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of the product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in a review conducted under section 1675 of this title involving a specific exporter, the administering authority disregarded some or all of the exporter's sales pursuant to paragraph (1) in the investigation or if a review has been completed, in the most recently completed review.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extended period of time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;extended period of time&rdquo; means a period that is normally 1 year, but not less than 6 months.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Substantial quantities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Sales made at prices below the cost of production have been made in substantial quantities if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the volume of such sales represents 20 percent or more of the volume of sales under consideration for the determination of normal value, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the weighted average per unit price of the sales under consideration for the determination of normal value is less than the weighted average per unit cost of production for such sales.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Recovery of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If prices which are below the per unit cost of production at the time of sale are above the weighted average per unit cost of production for the period of investigation or review, such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Calculation of cost of production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the cost of production shall be an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of materials and of fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the foreign like product, during a period which would ordinarily permit the production of that foreign like product in the ordinary course of business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an amount for selling, general, and administrative expenses based on actual data pertaining to production and sales of the foreign like product by the exporter in question; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the normal value is based on the price of the foreign like product sold for consumption in a country other than the exporting country, the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nonmarket economy countries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the subject merchandise is exported from a nonmarket economy country, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administering authority finds that available information does not permit the normal value of the subject merchandise to be determined under subsection (a) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the administering authority shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the valuation of the factors of production shall be based on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority finds that the available information is inadequate for purposes of determining the normal value of subject merchandise under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall determine the normal value on the basis of the price at which merchandise that is&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:356 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comparable to the subject merchandise, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) produced in one or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is sold in other countries, including the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors of production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the factors of production utilized in producing merchandise include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) hours of labor required,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) quantities of raw materials employed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) amounts of energy and other utilities consumed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) representative capital cost, including depreciation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Valuation of factors of production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority, in valuing factors of production under paragraph (1), shall utilize, to the extent possible, the prices or costs of factors of production in one or more market economy countries that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) significant producers of comparable merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rule for certain multinational corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, in the course of an investigation under this subtitle, the administering authority determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subject merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilities which are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a person, firm, or corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, other facilities for the production of the foreign like product which are located in another country or countries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the normal value of the foreign like product produced in one or more of the facilities outside the exporting country is higher than the normal value of the foreign like product produced in the facilities located in the exporting country,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">it shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise by reference to the normal value at which the foreign like product is sold in substantial quantities from one or more facilities outside the exporting country. The administering authority, in making any determination under this paragraph, shall make adjustments for the difference between the cost of production (including taxes, labor, materials, and overhead) of the foreign like product produced in facilities outside the exporting country and costs of production of the foreign like product produced in facilities in the exporting country, if such differences are demonstrated to its satisfaction. For purposes of this subsection, in determining the normal value of the foreign like product produced in a country outside of the exporting country, the administering authority shall determine its price at the time of exportation from the exporting country and shall make any adjustments required by subsection (a) of this section for the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States by reference to such costs in the exporting country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Constructed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the constructed value of imported merchandise shall be an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the merchandise, during a period which would ordinarily permit the production of the merchandise in the ordinary course of business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product, in the ordinary course of trade, for consumption in the foreign country, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if actual data are not available with respect to the amounts described in subparagraph (A), then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale, for consumption in the foreign country, of merchandise that is in the same general category of products as the subject merchandise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the weighted average of the actual amounts incurred and realized by exporters or producers that are subject to the investigation or review (other than the exporter or producer described in clause (i)) for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product, in the ordinary course of trade, for consumption in the foreign country, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the amounts incurred and realized for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, based on any other reasonable method, except that the amount allowed for profit may not exceed the amount normally realized by exporters or producers (other than the exporter or producer described in clause (i)) in connection with the sale, for consumption in the foreign country, of merchandise that is in the same general category of products as the subject merchandise; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (1), the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed <!-- PDFPage:357 -->on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such materials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special rules for calculation of cost of production and for calculation of constructed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsections (b) and (e) of this section.&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country (or the producing country, where appropriate) and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise. The administering authority shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a timely basis, if such allocations have been historically used by the exporter or producer, in particular for establishing appropriate amortization and depreciation periods, and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonrecurring costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those nonrecurring costs that benefit current or future production, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Startup costs</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for circumstances in which costs incurred during the time period covered by the investigation or review are affected by startup operations.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Startup operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Adjustments shall be made for startup operations only where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a producer is using new production facilities or producing a new product that requires substantial additional investment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) production levels are limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of subclause (II), the initial phase of commercial production ends at the end of the startup period. In determining whether commercial production levels have been achieved, the administering authority shall consider factors unrelated to startup operations that might affect the volume of production processed, such as demand, seasonality, or business cycles.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustment for startup operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The adjustment for startup operations shall be made by substituting the unit production costs incurred with respect to the merchandise at the end of the startup period for the unit production costs incurred during the startup period. If the startup period extends beyond the period of the investigation or review under this subtitle, the administering authority shall use the most recent cost of production data that it reasonably can obtain, analyze, and verify without delaying the timely completion of the investigation or review. For purposes of this subparagraph, the startup period ends at the point at which the level of commercial production that is characteristic of the merchandise, producer, or industry concerned is achieved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transactions disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A transaction directly or indirectly between affiliated persons may be disregarded if, in the case of any element of value required to be considered, the amount representing that element does not fairly reflect the amount usually reflected in sales of merchandise under consideration in the market under consideration. If a transaction is disregarded under the preceding sentence and no other transactions are available for consideration, the determination of the amount shall be based on the information available as to what the amount would have been if the transaction had occurred between persons who are not affiliated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Major input rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the case of a transaction between affiliated persons involving the production by one of such persons of a major input to the merchandise, the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an amount represented as the value of such input is less than the cost of production of such input, then the administering authority may determine the value of the major input on the basis of the information available regarding such cost of production, if such cost is greater than the amount that would be determined for such input under paragraph (2).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disclosure under court order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority denies a request for information under paragraph (1), then application may be made to the United States Customs Court for an order directing the administering authority or the Commission to make the information available. After notification of all parties to the investigation and after an opportunity for a hearing on the record, the court may issue an order, under such conditions as the court deems appropriate, which shall not have the effect of stopping or suspending the investigation, directing the administering authority or the Commission to make all or a portion of the requested information described in the preceding sentence available under a protective order and setting forth sanctions for violation of such order if the court finds that, under the standards applicable in proceedings of the court, such an order is warranted, and that&mdash;</p>

If the administering authority or the Commission claims a privilege as to a document or portion of a document in the administrative record of the proceeding in question and a binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee finds that in camera inspection or limited disclosure of that document or portion thereof is required by United States law, the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, may restrict access to such document or portion thereof to the authorized persons identified by the panel or committee as requiring access and may require such persons to obtain access under a protective order described in paragraph (2).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A decision concerning the disclosure or nondisclosure of material under protective <!-- PDFPage:363 -->order by the administering authority or the Commission shall not be subject to judicial review, and no court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review such decision on any question of law or fact by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents of protective order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each protective order issued under this subsection shall be in such form and contain such requirements as the administering authority or the Commission may determine by regulation to be appropriate.

The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. The amount of such civil penalty and other sanctions shall be assessed by the administering authority or the Commission by written notice, except that assessment shall be made by the administering authority for violation, inducement of a violation or receipt of information with reason to know that such information was disclosed in violation, of an undertaking entered into by any person with an authorized agency of a free trade area country (as defined in section 1516a(f)(10) of this title).</p>

The findings and order of the administering authority or the Commission shall be set aside by the court only if the court finds that such findings and order are not supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Enforcement of sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty or to comply with other administrative sanctions after the order imposing such sanctions becomes a final and unappealable order, or after the United States Court of International Trade has entered final judgment in favor of the administering authority or the Commission, an action may be filed in such court to enforce the sanctions. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the sanctions shall not be subject to review.</p>

In the case of disobedience to a subpoena issued under subparagraph (A), an action may be <!-- PDFPage:364 -->filed in any district or territorial court of the United States to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. Such court, within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on, may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other entity, issue any order requiring such individual or entity to appear before the administering authority or the Commission, or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence concerning the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Mandamus</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decline to take into account adjustments which are insignificant in relation to the price or value of the merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Selection of averages and samples</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority to select averages and statistically valid samples shall rest exclusively with the administering authority. The administering authority shall, to the greatest extent possible, consult with the exporters and producers regarding the method to be used to select exporters, producers, or types of products under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining weighted average dumping margins under section 1673b(d), 1673d(c), or 1675(a) of this title, the administering authority shall determine the individual weighted average dumping margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If it is not practicable to make individual weighted average dumping margin determinations under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may determine the weighted average dumping margins for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Investigations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In an investigation under part II of this subtitle, the administering authority shall determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the weighted average of the export prices (and constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by comparing the normal values of individual transactions to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority may determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a pattern of export prices (or constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the administering authority explains why such differences cannot be taken into account using a method described in paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reviews</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review under section 1675 of this title, when comparing export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions to the weighted average price of sales of the foreign like product, the administering authority shall limit its averaging of prices to a period not exceeding the calendar month that corresponds most closely to the calendar month of the individual export sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Determination of countervailable subsidy rate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining countervailable subsidy rates under section 1671b(d), 1671d(c), or 1675(a) of this title, the administering authority shall determine an individual countervailable subsidy rate for each known exporter or producer of the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition requesting monitoring</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A domestic producer of an article that is like a component part or a downstream product may petition the administering authority to designate a downstream product for monitoring under subsection (b) of this section. The petition shall specify&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the downstream product,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the component product incorporated into such downstream product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the reasons for suspecting that the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties has resulted in a diversion of exports of the component part into increased production and exportation to the United States of such downstream product.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:369 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination regarding petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 14 days after receiving a petition submitted under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether there is a reasonable likelihood that imports into the United States of the downstream product will increase as an indirect result of any diversion with respect to the component part, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the component part is already subject to monitoring to aid in the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement (within the meaning of section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) merchandise related to the component part and manufactured in the same foreign country in which the component part is manufactured has been the subject of a significant number of investigations suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title or countervailing or antidumping duty orders issued under this subtitle or section 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1677i_1_target" name="1677i_1">1</a></sup> of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) merchandise manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or exporter of the component part that is similar in description and use to the component part has been the subject of at least 2 investigations suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title or countervailing or antidumping duty orders issued under this subtitle or section 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1677i_1_target" name="1677i_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors to take into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (2)(A), the administering authority may, if appropriate, take into account such factors as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the value of the component part in relation to the value of the downstream product,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which the component part has been substantially transformed as a result of its incorporation into the downstream product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the relationship between the producers of component parts and producers of downstream products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Publication of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register notice of each determination made under paragraph (2) and, if the determination made under paragraph (2)(A) and a determination made under any subparagraph of paragraph (2)(B) are affirmative, shall transmit a copy of such determinations and the petition to the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Determinations not subject to judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any determination made by the administering authority under paragraph (2) shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Monitoring by Commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination made under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section and a determination made under any clause of subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section with respect to a petition are affirmative, the Commission shall immediately commence monitoring of trade in the downstream product that is the subject of the determination made under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section. If the Commission finds that imports of a downstream product being monitored increased during any calendar quarter by 5 percent or more over the preceding quarter, the Commission shall analyze that increase in the context of overall economic conditions in the product sector.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make quarterly reports to the administering authority regarding the monitoring and analyses conducted under paragraph (1). The Commission shall make the reports available to the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action on basis of monitoring reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall review the information in the reports submitted by the Commission under subsection (b)(2) of this section and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider the information in determining whether to initiate an investigation under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title regarding any downstream product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) request the Commission to cease monitoring any downstream product if the information indicates that imports into the United States are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversion with respect to component parts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;component part&rdquo; means any imported article that&mdash;</p>

If the Commission decides to provide such written advice, it shall promptly notify the administering authority of its intention to do so, and must provide such advice within 60 days after the date of notification under paragraph (1). For purposes of formulating its advice with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in the United States from parts or components produced in a foreign country, the Commission shall consider whether the inclusion of such parts or components taken as a whole would be inconsistent with its prior affirmative determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time limits for administering authority determinations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Treatment of voluntary responses in countervailing or antidumping duty investigations and reviews</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any investigation under part I or II of this subtitle or a review under section 1675(a) of this title in which the administering authority has, under section 1677f&ndash;1(c)(2) of this title or section 1677f&ndash;1(e)(2)(A) of this title (whichever is applicable), limited the number of exporters or producers examined, or determined a single country-wide rate, the administering authority shall establish an individual countervailable subsidy rate or an individual weighted average dumping margin for any exporter or producer not initially selected for individual examination under such sections who submits to the administering authority the information requested from exporters or producers selected for examination, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such information is so submitted by the date specified&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for exporters and producers that were initially selected for examination, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the foreign government, in a countervailing duty case where the administering authority has determined a single country-wide rate; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the number of exporters or producers who have submitted such information is not so large that individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person providing factual information to the administering authority or the Commission in connection with a proceeding under this subtitle on behalf of the petitioner or any other interested party shall certify that such informa<!-- PDFPage:374 -->tion is accurate and complete to the best of that person's knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Difficulties in meeting requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notification by interested party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an interested party, promptly after receiving a request from the administering authority or the Commission for information, notifies the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) that such party is unable to submit the information requested in the requested form and manner, together with a full explanation and suggested alternative forms in which such party is able to submit the information, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) shall consider the ability of the interested party to submit the information in the requested form and manner and may modify such requirements to the extent necessary to avoid imposing an unreasonable burden on that party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Assistance to interested parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority and the Commission shall take into account any difficulties experienced by interested parties, particularly small companies, in supplying information requested by the administering authority or the Commission in connection with investigations and reviews under this subtitle, and shall provide to such interested parties any assistance that is practicable in supplying such information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deficient submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the administering authority or the Commission determines that a response to a request for information under this subtitle does not comply with the request, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) shall promptly inform the person submitting the response of the nature of the deficiency and shall, to the extent practicable, provide that person with an opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency in light of the time limits established for the completion of investigations or reviews under this subtitle. If that person submits further information in response to such deficiency and either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) finds that such response is not satisfactory, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such response is not submitted within the applicable time limits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) may, subject to subsection (e) of this section, disregard all or part of the original and subsequent responses.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In reaching a determination under section 1671b, 1671d, 1673b, 1673d, 1675, or 1675b of this title the administering authority and the Commission shall not decline to consider information that is submitted by an interested party and is necessary to the determination but does not meet all the applicable requirements established by the administering authority or the Commission, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the information is submitted by the deadline established for its submission,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the information can be verified,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the information is not so incomplete that it cannot serve as a reliable basis for reaching the applicable determination,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the interested party has demonstrated that it acted to the best of its ability in providing the information and meeting the requirements established by the administering authority or the Commission with respect to the information, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the information can be used without undue difficulties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nonacceptance of submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the administering authority or the Commission declines to accept into the record any information submitted in an investigation or review under this subtitle, it shall, to the extent practicable, provide to the person submitting the information a written explanation of the reasons for not accepting the information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Public comment on information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Information that is submitted on a timely basis to the administering authority or the Commission during the course of a proceeding under this subtitle shall be subject to comment by other parties to the proceeding within such reasonable time as the administering authority or the Commission shall provide. The administering authority and the Commission, before making a final determination under section 1671d, 1673d, 1675, or 1675b of this title shall cease collecting information and shall provide the parties with a final opportunity to comment on the information obtained by the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) upon which the parties have not previously had an opportunity to comment. Comments containing new factual information shall be disregarded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Termination of investigation or revocation of order for lack of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) terminate an investigation under part I or II of this subtitle with respect to a domestic like product if, prior to publication of an order under section 1671e or 1673e of this title, the administering authority determines that producers accounting for substantially all of the production of that domestic like product have expressed a lack of interest in issuance of an order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) revoke an order issued under section 1671e or 1673e of this title with respect to a domestic like product, or terminate an investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title with respect to a domestic like product, if the administering authority determines that producers accounting for substantially all of the production of that domestic like product, have expressed a lack of interest in the order or suspended investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall verify all information relied upon in making&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a final determination in an investigation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a revocation under section 1675(d) of this title, and</p>

<!-- PDFPage:375 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) verification is timely requested by an interested party as defined in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no verification was made under this subparagraph during the 2 immediately preceding reviews and determinations under section 1675(a) of this title of the same order, finding, or notice, except that this clause shall not apply if good cause for verification is shown.</p>
