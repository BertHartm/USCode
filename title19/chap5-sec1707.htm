<p class="statutory-body">In addition to any other requirement of law, every vessel, not exceeding five hundred net tons, from a foreign port or place, or which has visited a hovering vessel, shall carry a certificate for the importation into the United States of any spirits, wines, or other alcoholic liquors on board thereof (sea stores excepted), destined to the United States, said certificate to be issued by a consular officer of the United States or other authorized person pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury may jointly prescribe. Any spirits, wines, or other alcoholic liquors (sea stores excepted) found, or discovered to have been, upon any such vessel at any place in the United States, or within the customs waters, without said certificate on board, which are not shown to have a bona fide destination without the United States, shall be seized and forfeited and, in the case of any such merchandise so destined to a foreign port or place, a bond shall be required in double the amount of the duties to which such merchandise would be subject if imported into the United States, conditioned upon the delivery of said merchandise at such foreign port or place as may be certified by a consular officer of the United States or otherwise as provided in said regulations: <em>Provided,</em> That if the collector shall be satisfied that the certificate required for the importation of any spirits, wines, or other alcoholic liquors was issued and was lost or mislaid without fraud, or was defaced by accident, or is incorrect by reason of clerical error or other mistake, said penalties shall not be incurred nor shall such bond be required. This section shall take effect on the sixtieth day following August 5, 1935.</p>
