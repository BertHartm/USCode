<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for supplies (including equipment), ground equipment, maintenance, or repair of aircraft registered in any foreign country and actually engaged in foreign trade or trade between the United States and any of its possessions, or between Hawaii and any other part of the United States or between Alaska and any other part of the United States, where trade by foreign aircraft is permitted. With respect to articles for ground equipment, the exemption hereunder shall apply only to duties and to taxes imposed upon or by reason of importation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reciprocal privileges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The privileges granted by this section and section 1317 of this title in respect of aircraft registered in a foreign country shall be allowed only if the Secretary of the Treasury shall have been advised by the Secretary of Commerce that he has found that such foreign country allows, or will allow, substantially reciprocal privileges in respect of aircraft registered in the United States. If the Secretary of Commerce shall advise the Secretary of the Treasury that he has found that a foreign country has discontinued, or will discontinue, the allowance of such privileges, the privileges granted by this section and such section 1317 shall not apply thereafter in respect of aircraft registered in that foreign country.</p>
