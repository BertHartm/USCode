<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Monitoring by Customs Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which a WTO member other than the United States requests consultations with the People's Republic of China under the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization, the Trade Representative shall inform the United States Customs Service, which shall monitor imports into the United States of those products of Chinese origin that are the subject of the consultation request. Data from such monitoring shall promptly be made available to the Commission upon request by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon the request of the President or the Trade Representative, upon resolution of either of the Committees, or on its own motion, the Commission shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether an action described in subsection (c) of this section has caused, or threatens to cause, a significant diversion of trade into the domestic market of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to respond to the presentations of other parties, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of subsections (a)(8) and (i) of section 2252 of this title, relating to treatment of confidential business information, shall apply to investigations conducted under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An action is described in this subsection if it is an action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by the People's Republic of China to prevent or remedy market disruption in a WTO member other than the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by a WTO member other than the United States to withdraw concessions under the WTO Agreement or otherwise to limit imports to prevent or remedy market disruption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by a WTO member other than the United States to apply a provisional safeguard within the meaning of the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:582 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any combination of actions described in paragraphs (1) through (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis for determination of significant diversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In determining whether significant diversion or the threat thereof exists for purposes of this section, the Commission shall take into account, to the extent such evidence is reasonably available&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the monitoring conducted under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the actual or imminent increase in United States market share held by such imports from the People's Republic of China;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the actual or imminent increase in volume of such imports into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the nature and extent of the action taken or proposed by the WTO member concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the extent of exports from the People's Republic of China to that WTO member and to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the actual or imminent changes in exports to that WTO member due to the action taken or proposed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) the actual or imminent diversion of exports from the People's Republic of China to countries other than the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) cyclical or seasonal trends in import volumes into the United States of the products at issue; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) conditions of demand and supply in the United States market for the products at issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The presence or absence of any factor under any of subparagraphs (A) through (I) is not necessarily dispositive of whether a significant diversion of trade or the threat thereof exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of making its determination, the Commission shall examine changes in imports into the United States from the People's Republic of China since the time that the WTO member commenced the investigation that led to a request for consultations described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If more than one action by a WTO member or WTO members against a particular product is identified in the petition, request, or resolution under subsection (b) of this section or during the investigation, the Commission may cumulatively assess the actual or likely effects of such actions jointly in determining whether a significant diversion of trade or threat thereof exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Commission determination; agreement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall make and transmit to the President and the Trade Representative its determination under subsection (b) of this section at the earliest practicable time, but in no case later than 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, under subsection (b) of this section. If the Commissioners voting are equally divided with respect to its determination, then the determination agreed upon by either group of Commissioners may be considered by the President and the Trade Representative as the determination of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Trade Representative is authorized to enter into agreements with the People's Republic of China or the other WTO members concerned to take such action as necessary to prevent or remedy significant trade diversion or threat thereof into the domestic market of the United States, and should seek to conclude such agreements before the expiration of the 60-day consultation period provided for under the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO, which shall commence not later than 5 days after the Trade Representative receives an affirmative determination provided for in paragraph (1) or a determination which the Trade Representative considers to be an affirmative determination pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Report by Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Not later than 10 days after a determination under subsection (b) of this section,<sup><a href="#2451a_1_target" name="2451a_1">1</a></sup> is made, the Commission shall transmit a report to the President and the Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Commission shall include in the report required under subparagraph (A) the following:</p>

Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section are eligible to vote on the proposed action to prevent or remedy the trade diversion or threat thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Any dissenting or separate views by members of the Commission regarding the determination and any recommendation referred to in clauses (i) and (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) A description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the short- and long-term effects that implementation of the action recommended under clause (ii) is likely to have on the petitioning domestic industry, on other domestic industries, and on consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the short- and long-term effects of not taking the recommended action on the petitioning domestic industry, its workers and the communities where production facilities of such industry are located, and on other domestic industries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission, after submitting a report to the President under subparagraph (A), shall promptly make it available to the public (with the exception of confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:583 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If consultations fail to lead to an agreement with the People's Republic of China or the WTO member concerned within 60 days, the Trade Representative shall promptly publish notice in the Federal Register of any proposed action to prevent or remedy the trade diversion, and provide an opportunity for interested persons to present views and evidence on whether the proposed action is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Recommendation to the President</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Review of circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2451a_2_target" name="2451a_2">2</a></sup> The Commission shall review the continued need for action taken under subsection (h) of this section if the WTO member or members involved notify the Committee on Safeguards of the WTO of any modification in the action taken by them against the People's Republic of China pursuant to consultation referred to in subsection (a) of this section. The Commission shall, not later than 60 days after such notification, determine whether a significant diversion of trade continues to exist and report its determination to the President.
