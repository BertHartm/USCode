<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) complete the entry, or substitute 1 or more reconfigured entries on an import activity summary statement, by filing with the Customs Service the declared value, classification and rate of duty applicable to the mer<!-- PDFPage:156 -->chandise, and such other documentation or, pursuant to an electronic data interchange system, such other information as is necessary to enable the Customs Service to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) properly assess duties on the merchandise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) collect accurate statistics with respect to the merchandise, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) determine whether any other applicable requirement of law (other than a requirement relating to release from customs custody) is met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The documentation or information required under paragraph (1) with respect to any imported merchandise shall be filed or transmitted in such manner and within such time periods as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe. Such regulations shall provide for the filing of import activity summary statements, and permit the filing of reconfigured entries, covering merchandise released under a special delivery permit pursuant to section 1448(b) of this title and entries or warehouse withdrawals made during a calendar month, within such time period as is prescribed in regulations but not to exceed the 20th day following such calendar month.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) When an entry of merchandise is made under this section, the required documentation or information shall be filed or electronically transmitted either by the owner or purchaser of the merchandise or, when appropriately designated by the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the merchandise, a person holding a valid license under section 1641 of this title. When a consignee declares on entry that he is the owner or purchaser of merchandise the Customs Service may, without liability, accept the declaration. For the purposes of this chapter, the importer of record must be one of the parties who is eligible to file the documentation or information required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary, in prescribing regulations to carry out this subsection, shall establish procedures which insure the accuracy and timeliness of import statistics, particularly statistics relevant to the classification and valuation of imports. Corrections of errors in such statistical data shall be transmitted immediately to the Director of the Bureau of the Census, who shall make corrections in the statistics maintained by the Bureau. The Secretary shall also provide, to the maximum extent practicable, for the protection of the revenue, the enforcement of laws governing the importation and exportation of merchandise, the facilitation of the commerce of the United States, and the equal treatment of all importers of record of imported merchandise.</p>

The reconciliation shall be filed by the importer of record at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes but not later than 21 months after the date the importer declares his intent to file the reconciliation. In the case of reconciling issues relating to the assessment of antidumping and countervailing duties, the reconciliation shall be filed not later than 90 days after the date the Customs Service advises the importer that the period of review for antidumping or countervailing duty purposes has been completed. Before filing a reconciliation, an importer of record shall post bond or other security pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations regarding AD/CV duties</h4>

No officer of the Customs Service shall be liable to any person with respect to the delivery of merchandise released from customs custody in accordance with such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Signing and contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Entries shall be signed by the importer of record, or his agent, unless filed pursuant to an electronic data interchange system. If electronically filed, each transmission of data shall be certified by an importer of record or his agent, one of whom shall be resident in the United States for purposes of receiving service of process, as being true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, and such transmission shall be binding in the same manner and to the same extent as a signed document. The entry shall set forth such facts in regard to the importation as the Secretary may require and shall be accompanied by such invoices, bills of lading, certificates, and documents, or their electronically submitted equivalents, as are required by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, in prescribing regulations governing the content of entry documentation, shall require that entry documentation contain such information as may be necessary to determine whether the imported merchandise bears an infringing trademark in violation of section 1124 of title 15 or any other applicable law, including a trademark appearing on the goods or packaging.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Production of invoice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may provide by regulation for the production of an invoice, parts thereof, or <!-- PDFPage:157 -->the electronic equivalents thereof, in such manner and form, and under such terms and conditions, as the Secretary considers necessary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States International Trade Commission shall establish from time to time for statistical purposes an enumeration of articles in such detail as in their judgment may be necessary, comprehending all merchandise imported into the United States and exported from the United States, and shall seek, in conjunction with statistical programs for domestic production and programs for achieving international harmonization of trade statistics, to establish the comparability thereof with such enumeration of articles. All import entries and export declarations shall include or have attached thereto an accurate statement specifying, in terms of such detailed enumeration, the kinds and quantities of all merchandise imported and exported and the value of the total quantity of each kind of article.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Statement of cost of production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Customs Service may require a verified statement from the manufacturer or producer showing the cost of producing the imported merchandise, if the Customs Service considers such verification necessary for the appraisement of such merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Admissibility of data electronically transmitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any entry or other information transmitted by means of an authorized electronic data interchange system shall be admissible in any and all administrative and judicial proceedings as evidence of such entry or information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Special rule for foreign trade zone operations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as provided in paragraph (3), all merchandise (including merchandise of different classes, types, and categories), withdrawn from a foreign trade zone during any 7-day period, shall, at the option of the operator or user of the zone, be the subject of a single estimated entry or release filed on or before the first day of the 7-day period in which the merchandise is to be withdrawn from the zone. The estimated entry or release shall be treated as a single entry and a single release of merchandise for purposes of section 58c(a)(9)(A) of this title and all fee exclusions and limitations of such section 58c of this title shall apply, including the maximum and minimum fee amounts provided for under subsection (b)(8)(A)(i) of such section. The entry summary for the estimated entry or release shall cover only the merchandise actually withdrawn from the foreign trade zone during the 7-day period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury may require that the operator or user of the zone&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use an electronic data interchange approved by the Customs Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to file the entries described in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to pay the applicable duties, fees, and taxes with respect to the entries; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) satisfy the Customs Service that accounting, transportation, and other controls over the merchandise are adequate to protect the revenue and meet the requirements of other Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply to merchandise the entry of which is prohibited by law or merchandise for which the filing of an entry summary is required before the merchandise is released from customs custody.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the terms &ldquo;foreign trade zone&rdquo; and &ldquo;zone&rdquo; mean a zone established pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934, commonly known as the Foreign Trade Zones Act (19 U.S.C. 81a et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Treatment of multiple entries of merchandise as single transaction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of merchandise that is purchased and invoiced as a single entity but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is shipped in an unassembled or disassembled condition in separate shipments due to the size or nature of the merchandise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is shipped in separate shipments due to the inability of the carrier to include all of the merchandise in a single shipment (at the instruction of the carrier),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Customs Service may, upon application by an importer in advance, treat such separate shipments for entry purposes as a single transaction.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entry examination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Imported merchandise that is required by law or regulation to be inspected, examined, or appraised shall not be delivered from customs custody (except under such bond or other security as may be prescribed by the Secretary to assure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and instructions which the Secretary or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce) until the merchandise has been inspected, appraised, or examined and is reported by the Customs Service to have been truly and correctly invoiced and found to comply with the requirements of the laws of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate the packages or quantities of merchandise covered by any invoice or entry which are to be opened and examined for the purpose of appraisement or otherwise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall order such packages or quantities to be sent to such place as is designated by the Secretary by regulation for such purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may require such additional packages or quantities as the Secretary considers necessary for such purpose; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall inspect a sufficient number of shipments, and shall examine a sufficient number of entries, to ensure compliance with the laws enforced by the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Unspecified articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any package contains any article not specified in the invoice or entry and, in the opinion of the Customs Service, the article was omitted from the invoice or entry&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with fraudulent intent on the part of the seller, shipper, owner, agent, importer of record, or entry filer, the contents of the entire package in which such article is found shall be subject to seizure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without fraudulent intent, the value of the article shall be added to the entry and the duties, fees, and taxes thereon paid accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a deficiency is found in quantity, weight, or measure in the examination of any package, the person finding the deficiency shall make a report thereof to the Customs Service. The Customs Service shall make allowance for the deficiency in the liquidation of duties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Information required for release</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an examination is conducted, any information required for release shall be provided, either electronically or in paper form, to the Customs Service at the port of examination. <!-- PDFPage:172 -->The absence of such information does not limit the authority of the Customs Service to conduct an examination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Testing laboratories</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Accreditation of private testing laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service shall establish and implement a procedure, under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, for accrediting private laboratories within the United States which may be used to perform tests (that would otherwise be performed by Customs Service laboratories) to establish the characteristics, quantities, or composition of imported merchandise. Such regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall establish the conditions required for the laboratories to receive and maintain accreditation for purposes of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall establish the conditions regarding the suspension and revocation of accreditation, which may include the imposition of a monetary penalty not to exceed $100,000 and such penalty is in addition to the recovery, from a gauger or laboratory accredited under paragraph (1), of any loss of revenue that may have occurred, but the Customs Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may seek to recover lost revenue only in cases where the gauger or laboratory intentionally falsified the analysis or gauging report in collusion with the importer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall neither assess penalties nor seek to recover lost revenue because of a good faith difference of professional opinion; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge for accreditation and periodic reaccreditation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The collection of any charge for accreditation and reaccreditation under this section is not prohibited by section 58c(e)(6) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Appeal of adverse accreditation decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A laboratory applying for accreditation, or that is accredited, under this section may contest any decision or order of the Customs Service denying, suspending, or revoking accreditation, or imposing a monetary penalty, by commencing an action in accordance with chapter 169 of title 28 in the Court of International Trade within 60 days after issuance of the decision or order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Testing by accredited laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When requested by an importer of record of merchandise, the Customs Service shall authorize the release to the importer of a representative sample of the merchandise for testing, at the expense of the importer, by a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1). The testing results from a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1) that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry shall, in the absence of testing results obtained from a Customs Service laboratory, be accepted by the Customs Service if the importer of record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the merchandise in the entry. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit in any way or preclude the authority of the Customs Service to test or analyze any sample or merchandise independently.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Availability of testing procedure, methodologies, and information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Testing procedures and methodologies used by the Customs Service, and information resulting from any testing conducted by the Customs Service, shall be made available as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Testing procedures and methodologies shall be made available upon request to any person unless the procedures or methodologies are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent related to such procedures or methodologies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Information resulting from testing shall be made available upon request to the importer of record and any agent thereof unless the information reveals information which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Miscellaneous provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any reference to a private laboratory includes a reference to a private gauger; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) accreditation of private laboratories extends only to the performance of functions by such laboratories that are within the scope of those responsibilities for determinations of the elements relating to admissibility, quantity, composition, or characteristics of imported merchandise that are vested in, or delegated to, the Customs Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Detentions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in the case of merchandise with respect to which the determination of admissibility is vested in an agency other than the Customs Service, the following apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within the 5-day period (excluding weekends and holidays) following the date on which merchandise is presented for customs examination, the Customs Service shall decide whether to release or detain the merchandise. Merchandise which is not released within such 5-day period shall be considered to be detained merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice of detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service shall issue a notice to the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise no later than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the decision to detain the merchandise is made. The notice shall advise the importer or other interested party of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the initiation of the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the specific reason for the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the anticipated length of the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:173 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the nature of any information which, if supplied to the Customs Service, may accelerate the disposition of the detention.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Testing results</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon request by the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise, the Customs Service shall provide the party with copies of the results of any testing conducted by the Customs Service on the merchandise and a description of the testing procedures and methodologies (unless such procedures or methodologies are proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent or were developed by the Customs Service for enforcement purposes). The results and test description shall be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Seizure and forfeiture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of failure to make determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The failure by the Customs Service to make a final determination with respect to the admissibility of detained merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been presented for customs examination, or such longer period if specifically authorized by law, shall be treated as a decision of the Customs Service to exclude the merchandise for purposes of section 1514(a)(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, a protest against the decision to exclude the merchandise which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was filed shall be treated as having been denied on such 30th day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding section 2639 of title 28, once an action respecting a detention is commenced, unless the Customs Service establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for good cause, the court shall grant the appropriate relief which may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the detention and release the merchandise.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deposit of estimated duties and fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the entry is subject to a periodic payment referred to in this subsection or the merchandise is entered for warehouse or transportation, or under bond, the importer of record shall deposit with the Customs Service at the time of entry, or at such later time as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation (but not later than 12 working days after entry or release) the amount of duties and fees estimated to be payable on such merchandise. As soon as a periodic payment module of the Automated Commercial Environment is developed, but no later than October 1, 2004, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations, after testing the module, permitting a participating importer of record to deposit estimated duties and fees for entries of merchandise, other than merchandise entered for warehouse, transportation, or under bond, no later than the 15 working days following the month in which the merchandise is entered or released, whichever comes first.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Collection or refund of duties, fees, and interest due upon liquidation or reliquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Customs Service shall collect any increased or additional duties and fees due, together with interest thereon, or refund any excess moneys deposited, together with interest thereon, as determined on a liquidation or reliquidation. Duties, fees, and interest determined to be due upon liquidation or reliquidation are due 30 days after issuance of the bill for such payment. Refunds of excess moneys deposited, together with interest thereon, shall be paid within 30 days of liquidation or reliquidation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest assessed due to an underpayment of duties, fees, or interest shall accrue, at a rate determined by the Secretary, from the date the importer of record is required to deposit estimated duties, fees, and interest to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. Interest on excess moneys deposited shall accrue, at a rate determined by the Secretary, from the date the importer of record deposits estimated duties, fees, and interest or, in a case in which a claim is made under section 1520(d) of this title, from the date on which such claim is made, to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. The Secretary may prescribe an alternative mid-point interest accounting methodology, which may be employed by the importer, based upon aggregate data in lieu of accounting for such interest from each deposit data provided in this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Delinquency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If duties, fees, and interest determined to be due or refunded are not paid in full within the 30-day period specified in subsection (b) of this section, any unpaid balance shall be considered delinquent and bear interest by 30-day periods, at a rate determined by the Secretary, from the date of liquidation or reliquidation until the full balance is paid.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulatory audit procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In conducting a regulatory audit under this section (which does not include a quantity verification for a customs bonded warehouse or general purpose foreign trade zone), the Customs Service auditor shall provide the person being audited, in advance of the audit, with a reasonable estimate of the time to be required for the audit. If in the course of an audit it becomes apparent that additional time will be required, the Customs Service auditor shall immediately provide a further estimate of such additional time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before commencing an audit, the Customs Service auditor shall inform the party to be audited of his right to an entry conference at which time the purpose will be explained and an estimated termination date set. Upon completion of on-site audit activities, the Customs Service auditor shall schedule a closing conference to explain the preliminary results of the audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in paragraph (5), if the estimated or actual termination date for an audit passes without the Customs Service auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the audit, the person being audited may petition in writing for such a conference to the officer designated pursuant to regulations, who, upon receipt of such a request, shall provide for such a conference to be held within 15 days after the date of receipt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as provided in paragraph (5), the Customs Service auditor shall complete the formal written audit report within 90 days following the closing conference unless the officer designated pursuant to regulations provides written notice to the person being audited of the reason for any delay and the anticipated completion date. After application of any exemption contained in section 552 of title 5, a copy of the formal written audit report shall be sent to the person audited no later than 30 days following completion of the report.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) If during the course of any audit concluded under this subsection, the Customs Service identifies overpayments of duties or fees or over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time period and scope of the audit that the Customs Service has defined, then in calculating the loss of revenue or monetary penalties under section 1592 of this title, the Customs Service shall treat the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as an offset to any underpayments or underdeclarations also identified on finally liquidated entries, if such overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize a refund not otherwise authorized under section 1520 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Service of summons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A summons issued pursuant to this section may be served by any person designated in the summons to serve it. Service upon a natural person may be made by personal delivery of the summons to him. Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering the summons to an officer, or managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. The certificate of service signed by the person serving the summons is prima facie evidence of the facts it states on the hearing of an application for the enforcement of the summons. When the summons requires the production of records, such records shall be described in the summons with reasonable specificity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any accountant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any summons is served on any person who is a third-party recordkeeper; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the summons requires the production of, or the giving of testimony relating to, any portion of records made or kept of the transactions described in section 1508 of this title of any person (other than the person summoned) who is identified in the description of the records contained in such summons;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then notice of such summons shall be given to any persons so identified within a reasonable time before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which such records are to be examined or testimony given. Such notice shall be accom<!-- PDFPage:188 -->panied by a copy of the summons which has been served and shall contain directions for staying compliance with the summons under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any notice required under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be sufficient if such notice is served in the manner provided in subsection (b) of this section upon the person entitled to notice, or is mailed by certified or registered mail to the last known address of such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not apply to any summons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) served on the person with respect to whose liability for duties, fees, or taxes the summons is issued, or any officer or employee of such person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to determine whether or not records of the transactions described in section 1508 of this title of an identified person have been made or kept.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any person who is entitled to notice of a summons under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall have the right&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) No examination of any records required to be produced under a summons as to which notice is required under paragraph (2) of this subsection may be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) before the expiration of the period allowed for the notice not to comply under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The provisions of paragraphs (2) and (5) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any summons if, upon petition by the Secretary, the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) List of records and information</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Avoidance of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No penalty may be assessed under this subsection if the person can show&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that the loss of the demanded information was the result of an act of God or other natural casualty or disaster beyond the fault of such person or an agent of the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the basis of other evidence satisfactory to the Customs Service, that the demand was substantially complied with; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Administrative review and modification of decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless a request for an accelerated disposition of a protest is filed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section the appropriate customs officer, within two years from the date a protest was filed in accordance with section 1514 of this title, shall review the protest and shall allow or deny such protest in whole or in part. Thereafter, any duties, charge, or exaction found to have been assessed or collected in excess shall be remitted or refunded and any drawback found due shall be paid. Upon the request of the protesting party, filed within the time allowed for the filing of a protest under section 1514 of this title, a protest may be subject to further review by another appropriate customs officer, under the circumstances and in the form and manner that may be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations, but subject to the two-year limitation prescribed in the first sentence of this subsection. Within 30 days from the date an application for further review is filed, the appropriate customs officer shall allow or deny the application and, if allowed, the protest shall be forwarded to the customs officer who will be conducting the further review. Notice of the denial of any protest shall be mailed in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary. Such notice shall include a statement of the reasons for the denial, as well as a statement informing the protesting party of his right to file a civil action contesting the denial of a protest under section 1514 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Request for accelerated disposition of protest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A request for accelerated disposition of a protest filed in accordance with section 1514 of this title may be mailed by certified or registered mail to the appropriate customs officer any time concurrent with or following the filing of such protest. For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, a protest which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in part within thirty days following the date of mailing by certified or registered mail of a request for accelerated disposition shall be deemed denied on the thirtieth day following mailing of such request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Request for set aside of denial of further review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a protesting party believes that an application for further review was erroneously or improperly denied or was denied without authority for such action, it may file with the Commissioner of Customs a written request that the denial of the application for further review be set aside. Such request must be filed within 60 days after the date of the notice of the denial. The Commissioner of Customs may review such request and, based solely on the information before the Customs Service at the time the application for further review was denied, may set aside the denial of the application for further review and void the denial of protest, if appropriate. If the Commissioner of Customs fails to act within 60 days after the date of the request, the request shall be considered denied. All denials of protests are effective from the date of original denial for purposes of section 2636 of title 28. If an action is commenced in the Court of International Trade that arises out of a protest or an application for further review, all administrative action pertaining to such protest or application shall terminate and any administrative action taken subsequent to the commencement of the action is null and void.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Voiding denial of protest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a protest is timely and properly filed, but is denied contrary to proper instructions, the Customs Service may on its own initiative, or pursuant to a written request by the protesting party filed with the appropriate port director within 90 days after the date of the protest denial, void the denial of the protest.</p>
