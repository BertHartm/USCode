<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2112. Barriers to and other distortions of trade</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; directives; disavowal of prior approval of legislation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade are reducing the growth of foreign markets for the products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, diminishing the intended mutual benefits of reciprocal trade concessions, adversely affecting the United States economy, preventing fair and equitable access to supplies, and preventing the development of open and nondiscriminatory trade among nations. The President is urged to take all appropriate and feasible steps within his power (including the full exercise of the rights of the United States under international agreements) to harmonize, reduce, or eliminate such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. The President is further urged to utilize the authority granted by subsection (b) of this section to negotiate trade agreements with other countries and instrumentalities providing on a basis of mutuality for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prior approval of any legislation which may be necessary to implement an agreement concerning barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presidential determinations prerequisite to entry into trade agreements; trade with Israel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the President determines that any barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade of any foreign country or the United States unduly burden and restrict the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affect the United States economy, or that the imposition of such barriers is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, and that the purposes of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President, during the 13-year period beginning on January 3, 1975, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers (or other distortions) or providing for the prohibition of or limitations on the imposition of such barriers (or other distortions).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Trade agreements that provide for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) only with Israel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The negotiation of any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States shall take fully into account any product that benefits from a discriminatory preferential tariff arrangement between Israel and a third country if the tariff preference on such product has been the subject of a challenge by the United States Government under the authority of section 2411 of this title and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the requirements of subsections (c) and (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no trade benefit shall be extended to any country by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to another country under a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with such other country that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a trade agreement that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) with any country other than Israel if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such country requested the negotiation of such an agreement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the President, at least 60 days prior to the date notice is provided under subsection (e)(1) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) provides written notice of such negotiations to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) consults with such committees regarding the negotiation of such agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of section 2191 of this title shall not apply to an implementing bill (within the meaning of section 2191(b) of this title if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such implementing bill contains a provision approving of any trade agreement which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) is entered into under this section with any country other than Israel, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the requirements of subparagraph (A) were not met with respect to the negotiation of such agreement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives disapproved of the negotiation of such agreement before the close of the 60-day period which begins on the date notice is provided under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) with respect to the negotiation of such agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The 60-day period described in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii)(II) shall be computed without regard to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the days on which either House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain or an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:408 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any Saturday and Sunday, not excluded under clause (i), when either House of Congress is not in session.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Presidential consultation with Congress prior to entry into trade agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the President enters into any trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, and with each committee of the House and the Senate and each joint committee of the Congress which has jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such trade agreement. Such consultation shall include all matters relating to the implementation of such trade agreement as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section. If it is proposed to implement such trade agreement, together with one or more other trade agreements entered into under this section, in a single implementing bill, such consultation shall include the desirability and feasibility of such proposed implementation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Submission to Congress of agreements, drafts of implementing bills, and statements of proposed administrative action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President enters into a trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall submit such agreement, together with a draft of an implementing bill (described in section 2191(b) of this title) and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, to the Congress as provided in subsection (e) of this section, and such agreement shall enter into force with respect to the United States only if the provisions of subsection (e) of this section are complied with and the implementing bill submitted by the President is enacted into law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Steps prerequisite to entry into force of trade agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each trade agreement submitted to the Congress under this subsection shall enter into force with respect to the United States if (and only if)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after entering into the agreement, the President transmits a document to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing a copy of the final legal text of such agreement together with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a draft of an implementing bill and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, and an explanation as to how the implementing bill and proposed administrative action change or affect existing law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a statement of his reasons as to how the agreement serves the interests of United States commerce and as to why the implementing bill and proposed administrative action is required or appropriate to carry out the agreement; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the implementing bill is enacted into law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Obligations imposed upon foreign countries or instrumentalities receiving benefits under trade agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To insure that a foreign country or instrumentality which receives benefits under a trade agreement entered into under this section is subject to the obligations imposed by such agreement, the President may recommend to Congress in the implementing bill and statement of administrative action submitted with respect to such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement apply solely to the parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement. The President may also recommend with respect to any such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement not apply uniformly to all parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In determining whether to recommend the imposition of a temporary duty to the President under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider whether the conditions in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph have led to a distortion in trade between the United States and Canada of the fresh fruit or vegetable and, if so, whether the imposition of the duty is appropriate, including consideration of whether it would significantly correct this distortion.</p>

If the determination is affirmative, the President shall proclaim the imposition and the rate of the temporary duty, but such duty shall not apply to the entry of articles that were in transit to the United States on the first day on which the temporary duty is in effect.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to further the environmental and trade policy goals of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. The United States is committed to a policy of careful assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements. The United States will factor environmental considerations into the development of its trade negotiating objectives. Responsible agencies will accomplish these goals through a process of ongoing assessment and evaluation, and, in certain instances, written environmental reviews.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:427 --><p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Purpose and Need</em>. Trade agreements should contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development. Environmental reviews are an important tool to help identify potential environmental effects of trade agreements, both positive and negative, and to help facilitate consideration of appropriate responses to those effects whether in the course of negotiations, through other means, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) <em>Implementation</em>. The United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality shall oversee the implementation of this order, including the development of procedures pursuant to this order, in consultation with appropriate foreign policy, environmental, and economic agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Conduct of Environmental Reviews</em>. The Trade Representative, through the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), shall conduct the environmental reviews of the agreements under section 4 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Trade Agreements.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Certain agreements that the United States may negotiate shall require an environmental review. These include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) comprehensive multilateral trade rounds;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) bilateral or plurilateral free trade agreements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) major new trade liberalization agreements in natural resource sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agreements reached in connection with enforcement and dispute resolution actions are not covered by this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) For trade agreements not covered under subsections 4(a) and (b), environmental reviews will generally not be required. Most sectoral liberalization agreements will not require an environmental review. The Trade Representative, through the TPSC, shall determine whether an environmental review of an agreement or category of agreements is warranted based on such factors as the significance of reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Environmental Reviews.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Environmental reviews shall be:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) written;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) initiated through a Federal Register notice, outlining the proposed agreement and soliciting public comment and information on the scope of the environmental review of the agreement;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) undertaken sufficiently early in the process to inform the development of negotiating positions, but shall not be a condition for the timely tabling of particular negotiating proposals;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) made available in draft form for public comment, where practicable; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) made available to the public in final form.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As a general matter, the focus of environmental reviews will be impacts in the United States. As appropriate and prudent, reviews may also examine global and transboundary impacts.</p>

Upon request by the Trade Representative, with the concurrence of the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide analytical and financial resources and support, including the detail of appropriate personnel, to the Office of the United States Trade Representative to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to restrict imports&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent an imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to cooperate with other countries in correcting an international balance-of-payments disequilibrium,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the President shall proclaim, for a period not exceeding 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a temporary import surcharge, not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem, in the form of duties (in addition to those already imposed, if any) on articles imported into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) temporary limitations through the use of quotas on the importation of articles into the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) both a temporary import surcharge described in subparagraph (A) and temporary limitations described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The authority delegated under subparagraph (B) (and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates to subparagraph (B)) may be exercised (i) only if international trade or monetary agreements to which the United States is a party permit the imposition of quotas as a balance-of-payments measure, and (ii) only to the extent that the fundamental imbalance cannot be dealt with effectively by a surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C). Any temporary import surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C) shall be treated as a regular customs duty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Import restrictions not imposed when contrary to national interest of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President determines that the imposition of import restrictions under subsection (a) of this section will be contrary to the national interest of the United States, then he may refrain from proclaiming such restrictions and he shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) immediately inform Congress of his determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) immediately convene the group of congressional official advisers designated under section 2211(a) of this title and consult with them as to the reasons for such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Presidential proclamations liberalizing imports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President determines that fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to increase imports&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to deal with large and persistent United States balance-of-trade surpluses, as determined on the basis of the cost-insurance-freight value of imports, as reported by the Bureau of the Census, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent significant appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the President is authorized to proclaim, for a period of 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a temporary reduction (of not more than 5 percent ad valorem) in the rate of duty on any article; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a temporary increase in the value or quantity of articles which may be imported under any import restriction, or a temporary suspension of any import restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Import liberalizing actions proclaimed pursuant to this subsection shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except that the President shall not proclaim measures under this subsection with respect to those articles where in his judgment such action will cause or contribute to material injury to firms or workers in any domestic industry, including agriculture, mining, fishing, or commerce, or to impairment of the national security, or will otherwise be contrary to the national interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nondiscriminatory treatment of import restricting actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be applied consistently with the principle of nondiscriminatory treatment. In addition, any quota proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subsection (a) of this section shall be applied on a basis which aims at a distribution of trade <!-- PDFPage:434 -->with the United States approaching as closely as possible that which various foreign countries might have expected to obtain in the absence of such restrictions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President determines that the purposes of this section will best be served by action against one or more countries having large or persistent balance-of-payments surpluses, he may exempt all other countries from such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After such time when there enters into force for the United States new rules regarding the application of surcharges as part of a reform of internationally agreed balance-of-payments adjustment procedures, the exemption authority contained in paragraph (2) shall be applied consistently with such new international rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) It is the sense of Congress that the President seek modifications in international agreements aimed at allowing the use of surcharges in place of quantitative restrictions (and providing rules to govern the use of such surcharges) as a balance-of-payments adjustment measure within the context of arrangements for an equitable sharing of balance-of-payments adjustment responsibility among deficit and surplus countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Broad and uniform application of import restricting actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except where the President determines, consistently with the purposes of this section, that certain articles should not be subject to import restricting actions because of the needs of the United States economy. Such exceptions shall be limited to the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the necessary importation of raw materials, avoiding serious dislocations in the supply of imported goods, and other similar factors. In addition, uniform exceptions may be made where import restricting actions will be unnecessary or ineffective in carrying out the purposes of this section, such as with respect to articles already subject to import restrictions, goods in transit, or goods under binding contract. Neither the authorization of import restricting actions nor the determination of exceptions with respect to product coverage shall be made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic industries from import competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Quantitative limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any quantitative limitation proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (a) of this section on the quantity or value, or both, of an article&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall permit the importation of a quantity or value which is not less than the quantity or value of such article imported into the United States from the foreign countries to which such limitation applies during the most recent period which the President determines is representative of imports of such article, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall take into account any increase since the end of such representative period in domestic consumption of such article and like or similar articles of domestic manufacture or production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Suspension, modification, or termination of proclamations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may at any time, consistent with the provisions of this section, suspend, modify, or terminate, in whole or in part, any proclamation under this section either during the initial 150-day period of effectiveness or as extended by subsequent Act of Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Termination of tariff concessions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of law authorizing the termination of tariff concessions shall be used to impose a surcharge on imports into the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consideration of past violations of trade concessions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before entering into any trade agreement under this section with any foreign country or instrumentality, the President shall consider whether such country or instrumentality has violated trade concessions of benefit to the United States and such violation has not been adequately offset by the action of the United States or by such country or instrumentality.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Retaliatory authority</h4>

Within 60 days after the date of any such termination or withdrawal, the President shall transmit to the Congress his recommendations as to the appropriate rates of duty for all articles which were affected by the termination or withdrawal or would have been so affected but for the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public hearings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before taking any action pursuant to subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, the President shall provide for a public hearing during the course of which interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard, unless he determines that such prior hearings will be contrary to the national interest because of the need for expeditious action, in which case he shall provide for a public hearing promptly after such action.</p>

<!-- field-end:effectivedate-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1979, to consolidate trade functions of the United States Government. I am acting under the authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act of 1977, chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code, and pursuant to section 1109 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 [19 U.S.C. 2111 note] which directs that I transmit to the Congress a proposal to restructure the international trade functions of the Executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">The goal of this reorganization is to improve the capacity of the Government to strengthen the export performance of United States industry and to assure fair international trade practices, taking into account the interests of all elements of our economy.</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent developments, which have raised concern about the vitality of our international trade performance, have focused much attention on the way our trade machinery is organized. These developments include our negative trade balance, increasing dependence upon foreign oil, and international pressures on the dollar. New challenges, such as implementation of the Multilateral Trade Negotiation (MTN) agreements and trade with non-market economies, will further test our Government trade organization.</p>
<p class="note-body">We must be prepared to apply domestically the MTN codes on procurement, subsidies, standards, and customs valuation. We also must monitor major implementation measures abroad, reporting back to American business on important developments and, where necessary, raising questions internationally about foreign implementation. MTN will work&mdash;will open new markets for U.S. labor, farmers, and business&mdash;only if we have adequate procedures for aggressively monitoring and enforcing it. We intend to meet our obligations, and we expect others to do the same.</p>
<p class="note-body">The trade machinery we now have cannot do this job effectively. Although the Special Trade Representative (STR) takes the lead role in administering the trade agreements program, many issues are handled elsewhere and no agency has across-the-board leadership in trade. Aside from the Trade Representative and the Export-Import Bank, trade is not the primary concern of any Executive branch agency where trade functions are located. The current arrangements lack a central authority capable of planning a coherent trade strategy and assuring its vigorous implementation.</p>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization is designed to correct such deficiencies and to prepare us for strong enforcement of the MTN codes. It aims to improve our export promotion activities so that United States exporters can take full advantage of trade opportunities in foreign markets. It provides for the timely and efficient administration of our unfair trade laws. It also establishes an efficient mechanism for shaping an effective, comprehensive United States trade policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">To achieve these objectives, I propose to place policy coordination and negotiation&mdash;those international trade functions that most require comprehensiveness, influence, and Government-wide perspective&mdash;in the Executive Office of the President. I propose to place operational and implementation responsibilities, which are staff-intensive, in line departments that have the requisite resources and knowledge of the major sectors of our economy to handle them. I have concluded that building our trade structure on STR and Commerce, respectively, best satisfies these considerations.</p>
<p class="note-body">I propose to enhance STR, to be renamed the Office of the United States Trade Representative, by centralizing in it international trade policy development, coordination and negotiation functions. The Commerce Department will become the focus of non-agricultural operational trade responsibilities by adding to its existing duties those for commercial representation abroad, antidumping and countervailing duty cases, the non-agricultural aspects of MTN implementation, national security investigations, and embargoes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">the united states trade representative</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Trade Representative, with the advice of the Trade Policy Committee, will be responsible for developing and coordinating our international trade and direct investment policy, including the following areas:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Import remedies</em>.&mdash;The Trade Representative will exercise policy oversight of the application of import remedies, analyze long-term trends in import remedy cases and recommend any necessary legislative changes. For antidumping and countervailing duty matters, such coordination, to the extent legally permissible, will be directed toward the establishment of new precedents, negotiation of assurances, and coordination with other trade matters, rather than case-by-case fact finding and determinations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>East-West trade policy</em>.&mdash;The Trade Representative will have lead responsibility for East-West trade negotiations and will coordinate East-West trade policy. The Trade Policy Committee will assume the responsibilities of the East-West Foreign Trade Board.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>International investment policy</em>.&mdash;The Trade Representative will have the policy lead regarding issues of direct foreign investment in the United States, direct investment by Americans abroad, operations of multinational enterprises, and multilateral agreements on international investment, insofar as such issues relate to international trade.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>International commodity policy</em>.&mdash;The Trade Representative will assume responsibility for commodity negotiations and also will coordinate commodity policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Energy trade</em>.&mdash;While the Departments of Energy and State will continue to share responsibility for international energy issues, the Trade Representative will coordinate energy trade matters. The Department of Energy will become a member of the TPC.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:452 --><p class="note-body"><em>Export-expansion policy</em>.&mdash;To ensure a vigorous and coordinated Government-wide export expansion effort, policy oversight of our export expansion activities will be the responsibility of the Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Trade Representative will have the lead role in bilateral and multilateral trade, commodity, and direct investment negotiations. The Trade Representative will represent the United States in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) matters. Since the GATT will be the principal international forum for implementing and interpreting the MTN agreements and since GATT meetings, including committee and working group meetings, occur almost continuously, the Trade Representative will have a limited number of permanent staff in Geneva. In some cases, it may be necessary to assign a small number of USTR staff abroad to assist in oversight of MTN enforcement. In this event, appropriate positions will be authorized. In recognition of the responsibility of the Secretary of State regarding our foreign policy, the activities of overseas personnel of the Trade Representative and the Commerce Department will be fully coordinated with other elements of our diplomatic missions.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to his role with regard to GATT matters, the Trade Representative will have the lead responsibility for trade and commodity matters considered in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) when such matters are the primary issues under negotiation. Because of the Secretary of State's foreign policy responsibilities, and the responsibilities of the Director of the International Development Cooperation Agency as the President's principal advisor on development, the Trade Representative will exercise his OECD and UNCTAD responsibilities in close cooperation with these officials.</p>
<p class="note-body">To ensure that all trade negotiations are handled consistently and that our negotiating leverage is employed to the maximum, the Trade Representative will manage the negotiation of particular issues. Where appropriate, the Trade Representative may delegate responsibility for negotiations to other agencies with expertise on the issues under consideration. He will coordinate the operational aspects of negotiations through a Trade Negotiating Committee, chaired by the Trade Representative and including the Departments of Commerce, State, Treasury, Agriculture and Labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Trade Representative will be concerned not only with ongoing negotiations and coordination of specific, immediate issues, but also&mdash;very importantly&mdash;with the development of long-term United States trade strategies and policies. He will oversee implementation of the MTN agreements, and will advise the President on the effects of other Government policies (e.g., antitrust, taxation) on U.S. trade. In order to participate more fully in oversight of international investment and export financing activities, the Trade Representative will become a member of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies and the Boards of the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In performing these functions, the Trade Representative will act as the principal trade spokesman of the President. To assure that our trade policies take into account the broadest range of perspectives, the Trade Representative will consult with the Trade Policy Committee, whose mandate and membership will be expanded. The Trade Representative will, as appropriate, invite agencies such as the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to participate in TPC meetings in addition to the permanent TPC members. When different departmental views on trade matters exist within the TPC as will be the case from time to time in this complex policy area, I will expect the Trade Representative to resolve policy disagreements in his best judgment, subject to appeal to the President.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">the department of commerce</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Commerce, under this proposal, will become the focal point of operational responsibilities in the non-agricultural trade area. My reorganization plan will transfer to the Commerce Department important responsibilities for administration of countervailing and antidumping matters, foreign commercial representation, and MTN implementation support. Consolidating these trade functions in the Department of Commerce builds upon an agency with extensive trade experience. The Department will retain its operational responsibilities in such areas as export controls, East-West trade, trade adjustment assistance to firms and communities, trade policy analysis, and monitoring foreign compliance with trade agreements. The Department will be substantially reorganized to consolidate and reshape its trade functions under an Under Secretary for International Trade.</p>
<p class="note-body">With this reorganization, trade functions will be strengthened within the Department of Commerce, and such related efforts in the Department as improvement of industrial innovation and the productivity, encouraging local and regional economic development, and sectoral analysis, will be closely linked to an aggressive trade program. Fostering the international competitiveness of American industry will become the principal mission of the Department of Commerce.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Import remedies</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">I propose to transfer to the Department of Commerce responsibility for administration of the countervailing duty and antidumping statutes. This function will be performed efficiently and effectively in an organizational setting where trade is the primary mission. This activity will be directed by a new Assistant Secretary for Trade Administration, subject to Senate confirmation. Although the plan permits its provisions to take effect as late as October 1, 1980, I intend to make this transfer effective by January 1, 1980, so that it will occur as the new MTN codes take effect. Commerce will continue its supportive role in the staffing of other unfair trade practice issues, such as cases arising under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411].</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Commercial representation</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization plan will transfer to the Department of Commerce responsibility for commercial representation abroad. This transfer would place both domestic and overseas export promotion activities under a single organization, directed by an Assistant Secretary for Export Development, charged with aggressively expanding U.S. export opportunities. Placing this Foreign Commercial Service in the Commerce Department will allow commercial officers to concentrate on the promotion of U.S. exports as their principal activity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Initially, the transfer of commercial representation from State to Commerce will involve all full-time overseas trade promotion and commercial positions (approximately 162), responsibility for this function in the countries (approximately 60) to which these individuals are assigned, and the associated foreign national employees in those countries. Over time, the Department of Commerce undoubtedly will review the deployment of commercial officers in light of changing trade circumstances and propose extensions or alterations of coverage of the Foreign Commercial Service.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>MTN implementation</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">I am dedicated to the aggressive implementation of the Multilateral Trade Agreements. The United States must seize the opportunities and enforce the obligations created by these agreements. Under this proposal, the Department of Commerce will assign high priority to this task. The Department of Commerce will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of non-agricultural aspects of the MTN agreements. Management of this function will be a principal assignment of an Assistant Secretary for Trade Policy and Programs. Implementation activities will include:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:453 --><p class="note-body-2em">monitoring agreements and targeting problems for consultation and negotiation;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">operating a Trade Complaint Center where the private sector can receive advice as to the recourse and remedies available;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">aiding in the settlement of disputes, including staffing of formal complaint cases;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">identifying problem areas for consideration by the Trade Representative and the Trade Policy Committee;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">educational and promotion programs regarding the provisions of the agreements and the processes for dealing with problems that arise;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">providing American business with basic information on foreign laws, regulations and procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">consultations with private sector advisory committees; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">general analytical support.</p>
<p class="note-body">These responsibilities will be handled by a unit built around the staff from Commerce that provided essential analytical support to STR throughout the MTN negotiation process. Building implementation of MTN around this core group will assure that the government's institutional memory and expertise on MTN is most effectively devoted to the challenge ahead. When American business needs information or encounters problems in the MTN area, it can turn to the Department of Commerce for knowledgeable assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Matching the increased importance of trade in the Department's mission will be a much strengthened trade organization within the Department. By creating a number of new senior level positions in the Department, we will ensure that trade policy implementation receives the kind of day-to-day top management attention that it both demands and requires.</p>
<p class="note-body">With its new responsibilities and resources, the Department of Commerce will become a key participant in the formulation of our trade policies. Much of the analysis in support of trade policy formulation will be conducted by the Department of Commerce, which will be close to the operational aspects of the problems that raise policy issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">To succeed in global competition, we must have a better understanding of the problems and prospects of U.S. industry, particularly in relation to the growing strength of industries abroad. This is the key reason why we will upgrade sectoral analysis capabilities throughout the Department of Commerce, including the creation of a new Bureau of Industrial Analysis. Commerce, with its ability to link trade to policies affecting industry, is uniquely suited to serve as the principal technical expert within the Government on special industry sector problems requiring international consultation, as well as to provide industry-specific information on how tax, regulatory and other Government policies affect the international competitiveness of the U.S. industries.</p>
<p class="note-body">Commerce will also expand its traditional trade policy focus on industrial issues to deal with the international trade and investment problems of our growing services sector. Under the proposal, there will be comprehensive service industry representation in our industry advisory process, as well as a continuing effort to bring services under international discipline. I expect the Commerce Department to play a major role in developing new service sector initiatives for consideration within the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">After an investigation lasting over a year, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to carry out the policy set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. As described above, this reorganization will increase significantly our ability to implement the MTN agreements efficiently and effectively and will improve greatly the services of the government with regard to export development. These improvements will be achieved with no increase in personnel or expenditures, except for an annual expense of about $300,000 for the salaries and clerical support of the three additional senior Commerce Department officials and a non-recurring expense of approximately $600,000 in connection with the transfers of functions provided in the plan. I find that the reorganization made by this plan makes necessary the provisions for the appointment and pay of a Deputy Secretary, an Under Secretary for International Trade, and two additional Assistant Secretaries of the Department of Commerce, and additional members of the Boards of Directors of the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is indeed appropriate that this proposal follows so soon after the overwhelming approval by the Congress of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 [19 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.], for it will sharpen and unify trade policy direction, improve the efficiency of trade law enforcement, and enable us to negotiate abroad from a position of strength. The extensive discussions between Administration officials and the Congress on this plan have been a model of the kind of cooperation that can exist between the two branches. I look forward to our further cooperation in successfully implementing both this reorganization proposal and the MTN agreements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In the course of any investigation under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall seek information (on a confidential basis, to the extent appropriate) on actions being taken, or planned to be taken, or both, by firms and workers in the industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Regardless whether an adjustment plan is submitted under paragraph (4) by the petitioner, if the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section, any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) firm in the domestic industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) certified or recognized union or group of workers in the domestic industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) State or local community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) trade association representing the domestic industry; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) any other person or group of persons,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may, individually, submit to the Commission commitments regarding actions such persons and entities intend to take to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in paragraphs (5) and (6) may be construed to provide immunity under the antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The procedures concerning the release of confidential business information set forth in section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332(g)] shall apply with respect to information received by the Commission in the course of investigations conducted under this part and part 1 of title III of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act [19 U.S.C. 3351 et seq.]. The Commission may request that parties providing confidential business information furnish nonconfidential summaries thereof or, if such parties indicate that the information in the submission cannot be summarized, the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. If the Commission finds that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the party concerned is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summarized form, the Commission may disregard the submission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigations and determinations by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a) of this section, the request of the President or the Trade Representative, the resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the Commission shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;substantial cause&rdquo; means a cause which is important and not less than any other cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 120 days (180 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If before the 100th day after a petition is filed under subsection (a)(1) of this section the Commission determines that the investigation is extraordinarily complicated, the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 150 days (210 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to comment on the adjustment plan, if any, submitted under subsection (a) of this section, to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Factors applied in making determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In making determinations under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall take into account all economic factors which it considers relevant, including (but not limited to)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) with respect to serious injury&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the significant idling of productive facilities in the domestic industry,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the inability of a significant number of firms to carry out domestic production operations at a reasonable level of profit, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) significant unemployment or underemployment within the domestic industry;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to threat of serious injury&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:473 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a decline in sales or market share, a higher and growing inventory (whether maintained by domestic producers, importers, wholesalers, or retailers), and a downward trend in production, profits, wages, productivity, or employment (or increasing underemployment) in the domestic industry,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the extent to which firms in the domestic industry are unable to generate adequate capital to finance the modernization of their domestic plants and equipment, or are unable to maintain existing levels of expenditures for research and development,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the extent to which the United States market is the focal point for the diversion of exports of the article concerned by reason of restraints on exports of such article to, or on imports of such article into, third country markets; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) with respect to substantial cause, an increase in imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) and a decline in the proportion of the domestic market supplied by domestic producers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making determinations under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider the condition of the domestic industry over the course of the relevant business cycle, but may not aggregate the causes of declining demand associated with a recession or economic downturn in the United States economy into a single cause of serious injury or threat of injury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) examine factors other than imports which may be a cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall include the results of its examination under subparagraph (B) in the report submitted by the Commission to the President under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, in determining the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with an imported article, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the extent information is available, shall, in the case of a domestic producer which also imports, treat as part of such domestic industry only its domestic production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, in the case of a domestic producer which produces more than one article, treat as part of such domestic industry only that portion or subdivision of the producer which produces the like or directly competitive article; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may, in the case of one or more domestic producers which produce a like or directly competitive article in a major geographic area of the United States and whose production facilities in such area for such article constitute a substantial portion of the domestic industry in the United States and primarily serve the market in such area, and where the imports are concentrated in such area, treat as such domestic industry only that segment of the production located in such area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the course of any proceeding under this subsection, the Commission shall investigate any factor which in its judgment may be contributing to increased imports of the article under investigation. Whenever in the course of its investigation the Commission has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable in part to circumstances which come within the purview of subtitles A and B of title VII [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq., 1673 et seq.] or section 337 [19 U.S.C. 1337] of the Tariff Act of 1930, or other remedial provisions of law, the Commission shall promptly notify the appropriate agency so that such action may be taken as is otherwise authorized by such provisions of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) The term &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo; means, with respect to an article, the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive article or those producers whose collective production of the like or directly competitive article constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of such article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo; includes producers located in the United States insular possessions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;significant idling of productive facilities&rdquo; includes the closing of plants or the underutilization of production capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;serious injury&rdquo; means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The term &ldquo;threat of serious injury&rdquo; means serious injury that is clearly imminent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Provisional relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) An entity representing a domestic industry that produces a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that is like or directly competitive with an imported perishable agricultural product or citrus product may file a request with the Trade Representative for the monitoring of imports of that product under subparagraph (B). Within 21 days after receiving the request, the Trade Representative shall determine if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the imported product is a perishable agricultural product or citrus product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there is a reasonable indication that such product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be, or likely to be, a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to such domestic industry.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Trade Representative shall request, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332(g)], the Commission to monitor and investigate the imports concerned for a period not to exceed 2 years. The monitoring and investigation may include the collection and analysis of information that would expedite an investigation under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:474 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) alleges injury from imports of a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that has been, on the date the allegation is included in the petition, subject to monitoring by the Commission under subparagraph (B) for not less than 90 days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to such imports;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall, not later than the 21st day after the day on which the request was filed, make a determination, on the basis of available information, whether increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the perishable agricultural product or citrus product are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive perishable product or citrus product, and whether either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the serious injury cannot be timely prevented through investigation under subsection (b) of this section and action under section 2253 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) At the request of the Commission, the Secretary of Agriculture shall promptly provide to the Commission any relevant information that the Department of Agriculture may have for purposes of making determinations and findings under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Whenever the Commission makes an affirmative preliminary determination under subparagraph (C), the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determination under subparagraph (C) and, if the determination is affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (E).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Within 7 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (F) containing an affirmative determination, the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (E), shall proclaim such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section alleges that critical circumstances exist and requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to imports of the article identified in the petition, the Commission shall, not later than 60 days after the petition containing the request was filed, determine, on the basis of available information, whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is clear evidence that increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the article are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) delay in taking action under this part would cause damage to that industry that would be difficult to repair.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) and, if the determinations are affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Within 30 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (C) containing an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii), the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (B), shall proclaim, for a period not to exceed 200 days, such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. Such relief shall take the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If provisional relief is proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D) in the form of an increase, or the imposition of, a duty, the President shall order the suspension of liquidation of all imported articles subject to the affirmative determination under paragraph (1)(C) or paragraph (2)(A), as the case may be, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any provisional relief implemented under this subsection with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) if such relief was proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D), the Commission makes a negative determination under subsection (b) of this section regarding injury or the threat thereof by imports of such article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) action described in section 2253(a)(3)(A) or (C) of this title takes effect under section 2253 of this title with respect to such article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a decision by the President not to take any action under section 2253(a) of this title with respect to such article becomes final; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) whenever the President determines that, because of changed circumstances, such relief is no longer warranted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any suspension of liquidation ordered under paragraph (3) with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which provisional relief is terminated under subparagraph (A) with respect to the article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty that is proclaimed under section 2253 of this title on an imported article is different from a duty increase or imposition that was pro<!-- PDFPage:475 -->claimed for such an article under this section, then the entry of any such article for which liquidation was suspended under paragraph (3) shall be liquidated at whichever of such rates of duty is lower.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If provisional relief in the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty is proclaimed under this section with respect to an imported article and neither a duty increase nor a duty imposition is proclaimed under section 2253 of this title regarding such article, the entry of any such article for which liquidation was suspended under paragraph (3) may be liquidated at the rate of duty that applied before provisional relief was provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;citrus product&rdquo; means any processed oranges or grapefruit, or any orange or grapefruit juice, including concentrate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A perishable agricultural product is any agricultural article, including livestock, regarding which the Trade Representative considers action under this section to be appropriate after taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) whether the article has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) a short shelf life,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a short growing season, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a short marketing period,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) whether the article is treated as a perishable product under any other Federal law or regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any other factor considered appropriate by the Trade Representative.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Trade Representative is required to take into account under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an article is a perishable agricultural product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;provisional relief&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any increase in, or imposition of, any duty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of an article into the United States; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section are eligible to vote on the recommendation required to be made under paragraph (1) or that may be made under paragraph (3).

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) So long as any action taken under section 2253 of this title remains in effect, the Commission shall monitor developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the initial period during which the action taken under section 2253 of this title is in effect exceeds 3 years, or if an extension of such action exceeds 3 years, the Commission shall submit a report on the results of the monitoring under paragraph (1) to the President and to the Congress not later than the date that is the mid-point of the initial period, and of each such extension, during which the action is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the course of preparing each report under paragraph (2), the Commission shall hold a hearing at which interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon request of the President, the Commission shall advise the President of its judgment as to the probable economic effect on the industry concerned of any reduction, modification, or termination of the action taken under section 2253 of this title which is under consideration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reduction, modification, and termination of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Action taken under section 2253 of this title may be reduced, modified, or terminated by the President (but not before the President receives the report required under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section) if the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after taking into account any report or advice submitted by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section and after seeking the advice of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor, determines, on the basis that either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the domestic industry has not made adequate efforts to make a positive adjustment to import competition, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effectiveness of the action taken under section 2253 of this title has been impaired by changed economic circumstances,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">that changed circumstances warrant such reduction, or termination; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determines, after a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry submits to the President a petition requesting such reduction, modification, or termination on such basis, that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President is authorized to take such additional action under section 2253 of this title as may be necessary to eliminate any circumvention of any action previously taken under such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President may, after receipt of a Commission determination under section 3538(a)(4) of this title and consulting with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, reduce, modify, or terminate action taken under section 2253 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon request of the President, or upon petition on behalf of the industry concerned filed with the Commission not earlier than the date which is 9 months, and not later than the date which is 6 months, before the date any action taken under section 2253 of this title is to terminate, the Commission shall investigate to determine whether action under section 2253 of this title continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and whether there is evidence that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold a public hearing at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, and to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall transmit to the President a report on its investigation and determination under this subsection not later than 60 days before the action under section 2253 of this title is to terminate, unless the President specifies a different date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evaluation of effectiveness of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After any action taken under section 2253 of this title has terminated, the Commission shall evaluate the effectiveness of the actions in facilitating positive adjustment by the domestic industry to import competition, consistent with the reasons set out by the President in the report submitted to the Congress under section 2253(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the course of the evaluation conducted under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, after reasonable public notice, hold a hearing on the effectiveness of the action. All interested persons shall have the opportunity to attend such hearing and to present evidence or testimony at such hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A report on the evaluation made under paragraph (1) and the hearings held under paragraph (2) shall be submitted by the Commission to the President and to the Congress by no later than the 180th day after the day on which the actions taken under section 2253 of this title terminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Action by the President under this part may be taken without regard to the provisions of section 2136(a) of this title but only after consideration of the relation of such actions to the international obligations of the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:483 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission treats as the domestic industry production located in a major geographic area of the United States under section 2252(c)(4)(C) of this title, then the President shall take into account the geographic concentration of domestic production and of imports in that area in taking any action authorized under paragraph (1).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments for such additional weeks may be made only for weeks in such 26-week period during which the individual is participating in such training.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on additional payments for training periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trade readjustment allowance may not be paid for an additional week specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section if the adversely affected worker who would receive such allowance did not make a bona fide application to a training program approved by the Secretary under section 2296 of this title within 210 days after the date of the worker's first certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance issued by the Secretary, or, if later, within 210 days after the date of the worker's total or partial separation referred to in section 2291(a)(1) of this title.</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;benefit year&rdquo; and &ldquo;extended benefit period&rdquo; shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.</p>

Insofar as possible, the Secretary shall provide or assure the provision of such training on the job, which shall include related education necessary for the acquisition of skills needed for a position within a particular occupation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The total amount of payments that may be made under paragraph (1) for any fiscal year shall not exceed $80,000,000, except that for fiscal year 1997, the total amount of payments made under paragraph (1) shall not exceed $70,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of applying paragraph (1)(C), a reasonable expectation of employment does not require that employment opportunities for a worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of training approved under this paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the costs of training an adversely affected worker are paid by the Secretary under paragraph (1), no other payment for such costs may be made under any other provision of Federal law.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Before approving any training to which subparagraph (A) may apply, the Secretary may require that the adversely affected worker enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which the Secretary will not be required to pay under this section the portion of the costs of such training that the worker has reason to believe will be paid under the program, or by the source, described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall not approve a training program if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under this part, or from wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Secretary may approve training for any adversely affected worker who is a member of a group certified under subpart A of this part at any time after the date on which the group is certified under subpart A of this part, without regard to whether such worker has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance to which the worker is entitled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations which set forth the criteria under each of the subparagraphs of paragraph (1) that will be used as the basis for making determinations under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supplemental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, where appropriate, authorize supplemental assistance necessary to defray reasonable transportation and subsistence expenses for separate maintenance when training is provided in facilities which are not within commuting distance of a worker's regular place of residence.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment of costs of on-the-job training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay the costs of any on-the-job training of an adversely affected worker that is approved under subsection (a)(1) of this section in equal monthly installments, but the Secretary may pay such costs, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no currently employed worker is displaced by such adversely affected worker (in<!-- PDFPage:494 -->cluding partial displacement such as a reduction in the hours of nonovertime work, wages, or employment benefits),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) no other individual is on layoff from the same, or any substantially equivalent, job for which such adversely affected worker is being trained,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the employer has not terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced the workforce of the employer with the intention of filling the vacancy so created by hiring such adversely affected worker,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the job for which such adversely affected worker is being trained is not being created in a promotional line that will infringe in any way upon the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such training is not for the same occupation from which the worker was separated and with respect to which such worker's group was certified pursuant to section 2272 of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the employer certifies to the Secretary that the employer will continue to employ such worker for at least 26 weeks after completion of such training if the worker desires to continue such employment and the employer does not have due cause to terminate such employment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the employer has not received payment under subsection (a)(1) of this section with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by such employer which failed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the employer has not taken, at any time, any action which violated the terms of any certification described in paragraph (8) made by such employer with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by such employer for which the Secretary has made a payment under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for unemployment insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A worker may not be determined to be ineligible or disqualified for unemployment insurance or program benefits under this subpart because the individual is in training approved under subsection (a) of this section, because of leaving work which is not suitable employment to enter such training, or because of the application to any such week in training of provisions of State law or Federal unemployment insurance law relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work. The Secretary shall submit to the Congress a quarterly report regarding the amount of funds expended during the quarter concerned to provide training under subsection (a) of this section and the anticipated demand for such funds for any remaining quarters in the fiscal year concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Suitable employment&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;suitable employment&rdquo; means, with respect to a worker, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment, and wages for such work at not less than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:508 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Loan guarantee conditions</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Preference for firms having employee stock ownership plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When considering whether to grant a direct loan or to guarantee a loan to a corporation which is otherwise certified under section 2341 of this title, the Secretary shall give preference to a corporation which agrees with respect to such loan to fulfill the following requirements&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 25 percent of the principal amount of the loan is paid by the lender to a qualified trust established under an employee stock ownership plan established and maintained by the recipient corporation, by a parent or subsidiary of such corporation, or by several corporations including the recipient corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employee stock ownership plan meets the requirements of this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the agreement among the recipient corporation, the lender, and the qualified trust relating to the loan meets the requirements of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee stock ownership plan does not meet the requirements of this subsection unless the governing instrument of the plan provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the loan paid under paragraph (1)(A) to the qualified trust will be used to purchase qualified employer securities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the qualified trust will repay to the lender the amount of such loan, together with the interest thereon, out of amounts contributed to the trust by the recipient corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) from time to time, as the qualified trust repays such amount, the trust will allocate qualified employer securities among the individual accounts of participants and their beneficiaries in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The agreement among the recipient corporation, the lender, and the qualified trust does not meet the requirements of this subsection unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is unconditionally enforceable by any party against the others, jointly and severally,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it provides that the liability of the qualified trust to repay loan amounts paid to the qualified trust may not, at any time, exceed an amount equal to the amount of contributions required under paragraph (2)(B) which are actually received by such trust,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) it provides that amounts received by the recipient corporation from the qualified trust for qualified employer securities purchased for the purpose of this subsection will be used exclusively by the recipient corporation for those purposes for which it may use that portion of the loan paid directly to it by the lender,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) it provides that the recipient corporation may not reduce the amount of its equity capital during the one year period beginning on the date on which the qualified trust purchases qualified employer securities for purposes of this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) it provides that the recipient corporation will make contributions to the qualified trust of not less than such amounts as are necessary for such trust to meet its obligation to make repayments of principal and interest on the amount of the loan received by the trust without regard to whether such contributions are deductible by the corporation under section 404 of title 26 and without regard to any other amounts the recipient corporation is obligated under law to contribute to or under the employee stock ownership plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) At the close of each plan year, an employee stock ownership plan shall allocate to the accounts of participating employees that portion of the qualified employer securities the cost of which bears substantially the same ratio to the cost of all the qualified employer securities purchased under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection as the amount of the loan principal and interest repaid by the qualified trust during that year bears to the total amount of the loan principal and interest payable by such trust during the term of such loan. Qualified employer securities allocated to the individual account of a participant during one plan year must bear substantially the same proportion to the amount of all such securities allocated to all participants in the plan as the amount of compensation paid to such participant bears to the total amount of compensation paid to all such participants during that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;employee stock ownership plan&rdquo; means a plan described in section 4975(e)(7) of title 26,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;qualified trust&rdquo; means a trust established under an employee stock ownership plan and meeting the requirements of title I of <!-- PDFPage:509 -->the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.] and section 401 of title 26,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) &ldquo;qualified employer securities&rdquo; means common stock issued by the recipient corporation or by a parent or subsidiary of such corporation with voting power and dividend rights no less favorable than the voting power and dividend rights on other common stock issued by the issuing corporation and with voting power being exercised by the participants in the employee stock ownership plan after it is allocated to their plan accounts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) &ldquo;equity capital&rdquo; means, with respect to the recipient corporation, the sum of its money and other property (in an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such property but disregarding adjustments made on account of depreciation or amortization made during the period described in paragraph (3)(D)), less the amount of its indebtedness.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13155, May 10, 2000, 65 F.R. 30521, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 141 and chapter 1 of title III of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2171, 2411&ndash;2420), section 307 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242<em>l</em>), and section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2151b), and in accordance with executive branch policy on health-related intellectual property matters to promote access to essential medicines, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. (a) In administering sections 301&ndash;310 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411&ndash;2420], the United States shall not seek, through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or revision of any intellectual property law or policy of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, as determined by the President, that regulates HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies if the law or policy of the country:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies for affected populations in that country; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) provides adequate and effective intellectual property protection consistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(15)).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The United States shall encourage all beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries to implement policies designed to address the underlying causes of the HIV/AIDS crisis by, among other things, making efforts to encourage practices that will prevent further transmission and infection and to stimulate development of the infrastructure necessary to deliver adequate health services, and by encouraging policies that provide an incentive for public and private research on, and development of, vaccines and other medical innovations that will combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Rationale</em>: (a) This order finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) since the onset of the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic, approximately 34 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected with the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) of those infected, approximately 11.5 million have died;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV/AIDS-related deaths worldwide; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) access to effective therapeutics for HIV/AIDS is determined by issues of price, health system infrastructure for delivery, and sustainable financing.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:520 --><p class="note-body">(b) In light of these findings, this order recognizes that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) it is in the interest of the United States to take all reasonable steps to prevent further spread of infectious disease, particularly HIV/AIDS;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) there is critical need for effective incentives to develop new pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and therapies to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis, including effective global intellectual property standards designed to foster pharmaceutical and medical innovation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the overriding priority for responding to the crisis of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa should be to improve public education and to encourage practices that will prevent further transmission and infection, and to stimulate development of the infrastructure necessary to deliver adequate health care services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) the United States should work with individual countries in sub-Saharan Africa to assist them in development of effective public education campaigns aimed at the prevention of HIV/AIDS transmission and infection, and to improve their health care infrastructure to promote improved access to quality health care for their citizens in general, and particularly with respect to the HIV/AIDS epidemic;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) an effective United States response to the crisis in sub-Saharan Africa must focus in the short term on preventive programs designed to reduce the frequency of new infections and remove the stigma of the disease, and should place a priority on basic health services that can be used to treat opportunistic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and complications associated with HIV/AIDS so as to prolong the duration and improve the quality of life of those with the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) an effective United States response to the crisis must also focus on the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) the innovative capacity of the United States in the commercial and public pharmaceutical research sectors is unmatched in the world, and the participation of both these sectors will be a critical element in any successful program to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body">(8) the TRIPS Agreement recognizes the importance of promoting effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights and the right of countries to adopt measures necessary to protect public health;</p>
<p class="note-body">(9) individual countries should have the ability to take measures to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic, provided that such measures are consistent with their international obligations; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(10) successful initiatives will require effective partnerships and cooperation among governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector, and greater consideration should be given to financial, legal, and other incentives that will promote improved prevention and treatment actions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Scope</em>. (a) This order prohibits the United States Government from taking action pursuant to section 301(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411(b)] with respect to any law or policy in beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries that promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies and that provides adequate and effective intellectual property protection consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. However, this order does not prohibit United States Government officials from evaluating, determining, or expressing concern about whether such a law or policy promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies or provides adequate and effective intellectual property protection consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. In addition, this order does not prohibit United States Government officials from consulting with or otherwise discussing with sub-Saharan African governments whether such law or policy meets the conditions set forth in section 1(a) of this order. Moreover, this order does not prohibit the United States Government from invoking the dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization to examine whether any such law or policy is consistent with the Uruguay Round Agreements, referred to in section 101(d) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act [19 U.S.C. 3511(d)].</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Trade Representative shall monitor the implementation of each measure undertaken, or agreement that is entered into, by a foreign country to provide a satisfactory resolution of a matter subject to investigation under this subchapter or subject to dispute settlement proceedings to enforce the rights of the United States under a trade agreement providing for such proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further action</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the basis of the monitoring carried out under subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative considers that a foreign country is not satisfactorily implementing a measure or agreement referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative shall determine what further action the Trade Representative shall take under section 2411(a) of this title. For purposes of section 2411 of this title, any such determination shall be treated as a determination made under section 2414(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) WTO dispute settlement recommendations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Failure to implement recommendation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the measure or agreement referred to in subsection (a) of this section concerns the implementation of a recommendation made pursuant to dispute settlement proceedings under the World Trade Organization, and the Trade Representative considers that the foreign country has failed to implement it, the Trade Representative shall make the determination in paragraph (1) no later than 30 days after the expiration of the reasonable period of time provided for such implementation under paragraph 21 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes that is referred to in section 3511(d)(16) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revision of retaliation list and action</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (ii), in the event that the United States initiates a retaliation list or takes any other action described in section 2411(c)(1)(A) or (B) of this title against the goods of a foreign country or countries because of the failure of such country or countries to implement the recommendation made pursuant to a dispute settlement proceeding under the World Trade Organization, the Trade Representative shall periodically revise the list or action to affect other goods of the country or countries that have failed to implement the recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Trade Representative is not required to revise the retaliation list or the action described in clause (i) with respect to a country, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the Trade Representative determines that implementation of a recommendation made pursuant to a dispute settlement proceeding described in clause (i) by the country is imminent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the Trade Representative together with the petitioner involved in the initial investigation under this subchapter (or if no petition was filed, the affected United States industry) agree that it is unnecessary to revise the retaliation list.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Schedule for revising list or action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Trade Representative shall, 120 days after the date the retaliation list or other <!-- PDFPage:525 -->section 2411(a) action is first taken, and every 180 days thereafter, review the list or action taken and revise, in whole or in part, the list or action to affect other goods of the subject country or countries.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Standards for revising list or action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In revising any list or action against a country or countries under this subsection, the Trade Representative shall act in a manner that is most likely to result in the country or countries implementing the recommendations adopted in the dispute settlement proceeding or in achieving a mutually satisfactory solution to the issue that gave rise to the dispute settlement proceeding. The Trade Representative shall consult with the petitioner, if any, involved in the initial investigation under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Retaliation list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;retaliation list&rdquo; means the list of products of a foreign country or countries that have failed to comply with the report of the panel or Appellate Body of the WTO and with respect to which the Trade Representative is imposing duties above the level that would otherwise be imposed under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Requirement to include reciprocal goods on retaliation list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Trade Representative shall include on the retaliation list, and on any revised lists, reciprocal goods of the industries affected by the failure of the foreign country or countries to implement the recommendation made pursuant to a dispute settlement proceeding under the World Trade Organization, except in cases where existing retaliation and its corresponding preliminary retaliation list do not already meet this requirement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any determination under subsection (b) of this section, the Trade Representative shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consult with the petitioner, if any, involved in the initial investigation under this subchapter and with representatives of the domestic industry concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide an opportunity for the presentation of views by interested persons.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) In the report, the Trade Representative shall identify countries that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) are not in compliance with their obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (the GPA), Chapter 10 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or other agreements relating to government procurement (procurement agreements) to which that country and the United States are parties; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) maintain, in government procurement, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. products or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses and whose products or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Considerations in Making Identifications</em>. In making the identifications required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall: (a) consider the requirements of the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, government procurement practices, and the effects of such practices on U.S. businesses as a basis for evaluating whether the procurement practices of foreign governments do not provide fair market opportunities for U.S. products or services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) take into account, among other factors, whether and to what extent countries that are parties to the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, and other countries described in section 1 of this part:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures for procurement that could have been conducted using competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) conduct what normally would have been one procurement as two or more procurements, to decrease the anticipated contract values below the value threshold of the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, or to make the procurement less attractive to U.S. businesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) announce procurement opportunities with inadequate time intervals for U.S. businesses to submit bids; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) use specifications in such a way as to limit the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) consider information included in the National Trade Estimate Report, and any other additional criteria deemed appropriate, including, to the extent such information is available, the failure to apply transparent and competitive procedures or maintain and enforce effective prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with government procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Impact of Noncompliance and Denial of Comparable Treatment</em>. The Trade Representative shall take into account, in identifying countries in the annual report and in any action required by this part, the relative impact of any noncompliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements, or of other discrimination on U.S. commerce, and the extent to which such noncompliance or discrimination has impeded the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements on terms comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question when seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Resolution</em>. Upon submission of the report required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall engage any country identified therein for the purpose of seeking a satisfactory resolution, for example, by obtaining compliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements or the elimination of the discriminatory procurement practices as quickly as possible, or, if this is not feasible, by providing for compensatory trade benefits.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Initiation of Investigations</em>. (a) Within 90 days of the submission of the report required by section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall initiate under section 302(b)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(1)) investigations with respect to any practice that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) was the basis for the identification of a country under section 1; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) is not at that time the subject of any other investigation or action under title III, chapter 1, of the Act [19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.],</p>
<p class="note-body-block">unless during the 90-day period the Trade Representative determines that a satisfactory resolution of the matter to be investigated has been achieved.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) For investigations initiated under paragraph (a) of this section (other than an investigation involving the GPA or NAFTA), the Trade Representative shall apply the time limits and procedures in section 304(a)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)). The time limits in subsection 304(a)(3)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)(B)) shall apply if the Trade Representative determines that:</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(2) the foreign country involved in the investigation is making substantial progress in drafting or implementing legislative or administrative measures that will end the discriminatory procurement practice; or</p>

<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 7207, July 1, 1999, 64 F.R. 36549, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The United States has had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade Relations with Mongolia since 1991 and has provided normal trade relations treatment to the products of Mongolia since that time. I have found Mongolia to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the &ldquo;Trade Act&rdquo;) (19 U.S.C. 2432).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Pursuant to section 2424(b)(1) of Public Law 106&ndash;36 [set out as a note above], and having due regard for the findings of the Congress in section 2424(a) of said Law, I hereby determine that title IV of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2431&ndash;2441) should no longer apply to Mongolia.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. On November 13, 1998, members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including the United States and 21 other major trading countries, announced in the WTO an agreement to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (the &ldquo;Uruguay Round&rdquo;). A similar agreement between the United States and 16 other major trading countries eliminating tariffs on enumerated pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates was implemented for the United States on April 1, 1997, by Proclamation 6982 [not classified to the Code], adding such goods to the scope of the agreement on pharmaceutical products reached at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and reflected in Schedule XX&ndash;United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Schedule XX).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)) authorizes the President to proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX for products that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round, if the United States agrees to such action in a multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO, and after compliance with the consultation and layover requirements of section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524). Section 111(b) also authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications as are necessary to reflect such duty treatment in Schedule XX by means of rectifications thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. On April 29, 1999, pursuant to section 115 of the URAA, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) submitted a report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate (&ldquo;the Committees&rdquo;) that sets forth the proposed tariff eliminations, together with the advice received from the appropriate private sector advisory committee and the United States International Trade Commission regarding the proposed tariff eliminations. During the 60-day period thereafter, the USTR consulted with the Committees on the proposed actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">6. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) [see 19 U.S.C. 1202] the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</p>
<p class="note-body">7. Pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined that Schedule XX should be modified to reflect the implementation by the United States of the multilateral agreement on certain pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates negotiated under the auspices of the WTO. In addition, I have determined that the pharmaceuticals appendix to the HTS should be modified to reflect the duty eliminations provided in such agreement, and to make certain minor technical corrections in the identification of particular products in order to ensure that products are accorded the intended duty treatment.</p>

In 1998, Albania concluded a bilateral investment treaty with the United States. Albania is in the process of acceding to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The extension of unconditional normal trade relations treatment to the products of Albania will permit the United States to avail itself of all rights under the WTO with respect to Albania when that country becomes a member of the WTO.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Investigation by International Trade Commission; report; publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon request of the President or the United States Trade Representative, upon resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the International Trade Commission (hereafter in this <!-- PDFPage:549 -->section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) shall promptly make an investigation to determine, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, whether market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of subsections (a)(3), (b)(4),<sup><a href="#2436_1_target" name="2436_1">1</a></sup> and (c)(4) of section 2252 of this title shall apply with respect to investigations by the Commission under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall report to the President its determination with respect to each investigation under paragraph (1) and the basis therefor and shall include in each report any dissenting or separate views. If the Commission finds, as a result of its investigation, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, it shall find the amount of the increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such market disruption and shall include such finding in its report to the President. The Commission shall furnish to the President a transcript of the hearings and any briefs which may have been submitted in connection with each investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The report of the Commission of its determination with respect to an investigation under paragraph (1) shall be made at the earliest practicable time, but not later than 3 months after the date on which the petition is filed (or the date on which the request or resolution is received or the motion is adopted, as the case may be). Upon making such report to the President, the Commission shall also promptly make public such report (with the exception of information which the Commission determines to be confidential) and shall cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) sections 2252 and 2253 of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act of 1988), rather than the provisions of part 1 of subchapter II of this chapter as amended by section 1401 of such Act of 1988, shall apply with respect to the taking of subsequent action, if any, by the President in response to such affirmative determination;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the President may take action under such sections 2252 and 2253 of this title only with respect to imports from the country or countries involved of the article with respect to which the affirmative determination was made; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Products of Communist countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time, the President finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall request the Commission to initiate an investigation under subsection (a) of this section. If the President further finds that emergency action is necessary, he may take action under sections 2252 and 2253 of this title referred to in subsection (b) of this section as if an affirmative determination of the Commission had been made under subsection (a) of this section. Any action taken by the President under the preceding sentence shall cease to apply (1) if a negative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the Commission's report of such determination is submitted to the President, or (2) if an affirmative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the action taken by the President pursuant to such determination becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petitions to initiate consultations as provided for by safeguard arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition may be filed with the President by an entity described in section 2251(a)(1) of this title requesting the President to initiate consultations provided for by the safeguard arrangements of any agreement entered into under section 2435 of this title with respect to imports of an article which is the product of the country which is the other party to such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the President determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of such article, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall initiate consultations with such country with respect to such imports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions; factors determining existence of market disruption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Imports of an article shall be considered to be increasing rapidly if there has been a significant increase in such imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) during a recent period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The term &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:550 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission, in determining whether market disruption exists, shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the volume of imports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effect of imports of the merchandise on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of like or directly competitive articles; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a product of the People's Republic of China is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of a like or directly competitive product, the President shall, in accordance with the provisions of this section, proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions with respect to such product, to the extent and for such period as the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the market disruption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of an investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon the request of the President or the United States Trade Representative (in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Trade Representative&rdquo;), upon resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, or the Committee on Finance of the Senate (in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Committees&rdquo;) or on its own motion, the United States International Trade Commission (in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether products of the People's Republic of China are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The limitations on investigations set forth in section 2252(h)(1) of this title shall apply to investigations conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of subsections (a)(8) and (i) of section 2252 of this title, relating to treatment of confidential business information, shall apply to investigations conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever a petition is filed, or a request or resolution is received, under this subsection, the Commission shall transmit a copy thereof to the President, the Trade Representative, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, except that in the case of confidential business information, the copy may include only nonconfidential summaries of such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to respond to the presentations of other parties, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Market disruption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, market disruption exists whenever imports of an article like or directly competitive with an article produced by a domestic industry are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat of material injury, to the domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:553 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Factors in determination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the volume of imports of the product which is the subject of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the effect of imports of such product on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the effect of imports of such product on the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The presence or absence of any factor under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) is not necessarily dispositive of whether market disruption exists.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall make and transmit to the President and the Trade Representative its determination under subsection (b)(1) of this section at the earliest practicable time, but in no case later than 60 days (or 90 days in the case of a petition requesting relief under subsection (i) of this section) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, under subsection (b) of this section. If the Commissioners voting are equally divided with respect to its determination, then the determination agreed upon by either group of Commissioners may be considered by the President and the Trade Representative as the determination of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recommendations of Commission on proposed remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section, or a determination which the President or the Trade Representative may consider as affirmative under subsection (e) of this section, the Commission shall propose the amount of increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restrictions necessary to prevent or remedy the market disruption. Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section are eligible to vote on the proposed action to prevent or remedy market disruption. Members of the Commission who did not agree to the affirmative determination may submit, in the report required under subsection (g) of this section, separate views regarding what action, if any, should be taken to prevent or remedy market disruption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Report by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 20 days after a determination under subsection (b) of this section is made, the Commission shall submit a report to the President and the Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall include in the report required under paragraph (1) the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The determination made under subsection (b) of this section and an explanation of the basis for the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the determination under subsection (b) of this section is affirmative, or may be considered by the President or the Trade Representative as affirmative under subsection (e) of this section, the recommendations of the Commission on proposed remedies under subsection (f) of this section and an explanation of the basis for each recommendation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any dissenting or separate views by members of the Commission regarding the determination and any recommendation referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the short- and long-term effects that implementation of the action recommended under subsection (f) of this section is likely to have on the petitioning domestic industry, on other domestic industries, and on consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the short- and long-term effects of not taking the recommended action on the petitioning domestic industry, its workers, and the communities where production facilities of such industry are located, and on other domestic industries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission, after submitting a report to the President under paragraph (1), shall promptly make it available to the public (but shall not include confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Opportunity to present views and evidence on proposed measure and recommendation to the President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 20 days after receipt of the Commission's report under subsection (g) of this section (or 15 days in the case of an affirmative preliminary determination under subsection (i)(1)(B) of this section), the Trade Representative shall publish in the Federal Register notice of any measure proposed by the Trade Representative to be taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and of the opportunity, including a public hearing, if requested, for importers, exporters, and other interested parties to submit their views and evidence on the appropriateness of the proposed measure and whether it would be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 55 days after receipt of the report under subsection (g) of this section (or 35 days in the case of an affirmative preliminary determination under subsection (i)(1)(B) of this section), the Trade Representative, taking into account the views and evidence received under paragraph (1) on the measure proposed by the Trade Representative, shall make a recommendation to the President concerning what action, if any, to take to prevent or remedy the market disruption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Critical circumstances</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President may determine under paragraph (1) that providing import relief is not in the national economic interest of the United States only if the President finds that the taking of such action would have an adverse impact on the United States economy clearly greater than the benefits of such action.</p>

The Commission shall transmit such report to the President within 60 days of the request.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:555 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The President may, after receiving a report from the Commission under paragraph (1), take such action to modify, reduce, or terminate relief that the President determines is necessary to continue to prevent or remedy the market disruption at issue.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon request of the President, or upon petition on behalf of the industry concerned filed with the Commission not earlier than the date which is 9 months, and not later than the date which is 6 months, before the date any relief provided under subsection (k) of this section is to terminate, the Commission shall investigate to determine whether action under this section continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy market disruption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold a public hearing at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, and to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Monitoring by Customs Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which a WTO member other than the United States requests consultations with the People's Republic of China under the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization, the Trade Representative shall inform the United States Customs Service, which shall monitor imports into the United States of those products of Chinese origin that are the subject of the consultation request. Data from such monitoring shall promptly be made available to the Commission upon request by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiation of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon the request of the President or the Trade Representative, upon resolution of either of the Committees, or on its own motion, the Commission shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether an action described in subsection (c) of this section has caused, or threatens to cause, a significant diversion of trade into the domestic market of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to respond to the presentations of other parties, and otherwise to be heard.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An action is described in this subsection if it is an action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by the People's Republic of China to prevent or remedy market disruption in a WTO member other than the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by a WTO member other than the United States to withdraw concessions under the WTO Agreement or otherwise to limit imports to prevent or remedy market disruption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by a WTO member other than the United States to apply a provisional safeguard within the meaning of the product-specific safeguard provision of the Protocol of Accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any combination of actions described in paragraphs (1) through (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis for determination of significant diversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In determining whether significant diversion or the threat thereof exists for purposes of this section, the Commission shall take into account, to the extent such evidence is reasonably available&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the monitoring conducted under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the actual or imminent increase in United States market share held by such imports from the People's Republic of China;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the actual or imminent increase in volume of such imports into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the nature and extent of the action taken or proposed by the WTO member concerned;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) conditions of demand and supply in the United States market for the products at issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The presence or absence of any factor under any of subparagraphs (A) through (I) is not necessarily dispositive of whether a significant diversion of trade or the threat thereof exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of making its determination, the Commission shall examine changes in imports into the United States from the People's Republic of China since the time that the WTO member commenced the investigation that led to a request for consultations described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If more than one action by a WTO member or WTO members against a particular product is identified in the petition, request, or resolution under subsection (b) of this section or during the investigation, the Commission may cumulatively assess the actual or likely effects of such actions jointly in determining whether a significant diversion of trade or threat thereof exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Commission determination; agreement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall make and transmit to the President and the Trade Representative its determination under subsection (b) of this section at the earliest practicable time, but in no case later than 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, under subsection (b) of this section. If the Commissioners voting are equally divided with respect to its determination, then the determination agreed upon by either group of Commissioners may be considered by the President and the Trade Representative as the determination of the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Report by Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Not later than 10 days after a determination under subsection (b) of this section,<sup><a href="#2451a_1_target" name="2451a_1">1</a></sup> is made, the Commission shall transmit a report to the President and the Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Commission shall include in the report required under subparagraph (A) the following:</p>

Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) of this section are eligible to vote on the proposed action to prevent or remedy the trade diversion or threat thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) A description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the short- and long-term effects that implementation of the action recommended under clause (ii) is likely to have on the petitioning domestic industry, on other domestic industries, and on consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the short- and long-term effects of not taking the recommended action on the petitioning domestic industry, its workers and the communities where production facilities of such industry are located, and on other domestic industries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission, after submitting a report to the President under subparagraph (A), shall promptly make it available to the public (with the exception of confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If consultations fail to lead to an agreement with the People's Republic of China or the WTO member concerned within 60 days, the Trade Representative shall promptly publish notice in the Federal Register of any proposed action to prevent or remedy the trade diversion, and provide an opportunity for interested persons to present views and evidence on whether the proposed action is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Recommendation to the President</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2451a_1_target" name="2451a_1">1</a></sup> The Commission shall review the continued need for action taken under subsection (h) of this section if the WTO member or members involved notify the Committee on Safeguards of the WTO of any modification in the action taken by them against the People's Republic of China pursuant to consultation referred to in subsection (a) of this section. The Commission shall, not later than 60 days after such notification, determine whether a significant diversion of trade continues to exist and report its determination to the President.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the President is authorized to designate articles as eligible articles from all beneficiary developing countries for purposes of this subchapter by Executive order or Presidential proclamation after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Least-developed beneficiary developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except for articles described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (E) of subsection (b)(1) of this section and articles described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of this section, the President may, in carrying out section 2462(d)(1) of this title and subsection (c)(1) of this section, designate articles as eligible articles only for countries designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries under section 2462(a)(2) of this title if, after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from least-developed beneficiary developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Three-year rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission under subsection (e) of this section, an article has been formally considered for designation as an eligible article under this subchapter and denied such designation, such article may not be reconsidered for such designation for a period of 3 years after such denial.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of origin</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The duty-free treatment provided under this subchapter shall apply to any eligible article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that article is imported directly from a beneficiary developing country into the customs territory of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the cost or value of the materials produced in the beneficiary developing country or any two or more such countries that are members of the same association of countries and are treated as one country under section 2467(2) of this title, plus</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of such article at the time it is entered.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An article shall not be treated as the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country by virtue of having merely undergone&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) simple combining or packaging operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the United States Trade Representative, shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out paragraph (2), including, but not limited to, regulations providing that, in order to be eligible for duty-<!-- PDFPage:561 -->free treatment under this subchapter, an article&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) must be a new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the beneficiary developing country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Articles that may not be designated as eligible articles</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Import-sensitive articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President may not designate any article as an eligible article under subsection (a) of this section if such article is within one of the following categories of import-sensitive articles:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Watches, except those watches entered after June 30, 1989, that the President specifically determines, after public notice and comment, will not cause material injury to watch or watch band, strap, or bracelet manufacturing and assembly operations in the United States or the United States insular possessions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Import-sensitive electronic articles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Import-sensitive steel articles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Footwear, handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel which were not eligible articles for purposes of this subchapter on January 1, 1995, as this subchapter was in effect on such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Import-sensitive semimanufactured and manufactured glass products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Any other articles which the President determines to be import-sensitive in the context of the Generalized System of Preferences.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Articles against which other actions taken</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An article shall not be an eligible article for purposes of this subchapter for any period during which such article is the subject of any action proclaimed pursuant to section 2253 of this title or section 1862 or 1981 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Agricultural products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No quantity of an agricultural product subject to a tariff-rate quota that exceeds the in-quota quantity shall be eligible for duty-free treatment under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Withdrawal, suspension, or limitation of duty-free treatment; competitive need limitation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment accorded under this subchapter with respect to any article, except that no rate of duty may be established with respect to any article pursuant to this subsection other than the rate which would apply but for this subchapter. In taking any action under this subsection, the President shall consider the factors set forth in sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Competitive need limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Basis for withdrawal of duty-free treatment</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (ii) and subject to subsection (d) of this section, whenever the President determines that a beneficiary developing country has exported (directly or indirectly) to the United States during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1995&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a quantity of an eligible article having an appraised value in excess of the applicable amount for the calendar year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a quantity of an eligible article equal to or exceeding 50 percent of the appraised value of the total imports of that article into the United States during any calendar year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;the President shall, not later than July 1 of the next calendar year, terminate the duty-free treatment for that article from that beneficiary developing country.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Annual adjustment of applicable amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of applying clause (i), the applicable amount is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for 1996, $75,000,000, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for each calendar year thereafter, an amount equal to the applicable amount in effect for the preceding calendar year plus $5,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Country&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;country&rdquo; does not include an association of countries which is treated as one country under section 2467(2) of this title, but does include a country which is a member of any such association.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) Since the 18th century, the principle of nondiscrimination among countries with which the United States has trade relations, commonly referred to as &lsquo;most-favored-nation&rsquo; treatment, has been a cornerstone of United States trade policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Although the principle remains firmly in place as a fundamental concept in United States trade relations, the term &lsquo;most-favored-nation&rsquo; is a misnomer which has led to public misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the most-favored-nation principle to treat any country as &lsquo;most favored&rsquo;. To the contrary, the principle reflects the intention to confer on a country the same trade benefits that are conferred on any other country, that is, the intention not to discriminate among trading partners.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) The term &lsquo;normal trade relations&rsquo; is a more accurate description of the principle of nondiscrimination as it applies to the tariffs applicable generally to imports from United States trading partners, that is, the general rates of duty set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) the language used in United States laws, treaties, agreements, executive orders, directives, and regulations should more clearly and accurately reflect the underlying principles of United States trade policy; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) accordingly, the term &lsquo;normal trade relations&rsquo; should, where appropriate, be substituted for the term &lsquo;most-favored-nation&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 6914. To Modify the Allocation of Tariff-Rate Quotas for Certain Cheeses</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 6914, Aug. 26, 1996, 61 F.R. 45851, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. On January 1, 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden acceded to the European Communities (EC), and the EC customs union of 12 member countries (&ldquo;EC-12&rdquo;) was enlarged to a customs union of 15 member countries (&ldquo;EC-15&rdquo;). At that time, the EC-12, Austria, Finland, and Sweden withdrew their tariff schedules under the World Trade Organization and applied the common external tariff of the EC-12 to imports into the EC-15. The United States and the EC then entered into negotiations under Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 to compensate the United States for the resulting increase in some tariffs on U.S. exports to Austria, Finland, and Sweden.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. On July 22, 1996, the United States and the EC signed an agreement concluding the negotiations on compensation. To recognize the membership of Austria, Finland, and Sweden in the EC-15, the tariff-rate quota (TRQ) allocations for cheeses from these countries will become part of the total TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be reserved for use by these countries through 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Section 404(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)) authorizes the President to allocate the in-quota quantity of a tariff-rate quota for any agricultural product among supplying countries or customs areas and to modify any allocation as the President determines appropriate. Pursuant to section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the TRQ allocations for cheeses by providing that the TRQ allocations for cheeses from Austria, Finland, and Sweden will become part of the total TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be reserved for use by these countries through 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (&ldquo;Trade Act&rdquo;) (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. The modification of the TRQ allocations for cheeses is such an action.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. In paragraph (3) of Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, I delegated my authority under section 404(d)(3) of the Trade Act [probably means section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, 19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)] to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the USTR to exercise my authority under section 604 of the Trade Act [19 U.S.C. 2483] to embody in the HTS the substance of any action taken by the USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, and section 604 of the Trade Act do proclaim that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Additional U.S. notes to chapter 4 of the HTS are modified as specified in the Annex to this proclamation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The USTR is authorized to exercise my authority under section 604 of the Trade Act [19 U.S.C. 2483] to embody in the HTS the substance of any actions taken by USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA [19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)].</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) This proclamation is effective on the date of signature of this proclamation, and the modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective on the dates that are specified in that Annex.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-first.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A country which in the previous year was designated as a major drug producing country or a major drug-transit country may not be determined to be cooperating fully under subparagraph (A)(i) unless it has in place a bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States or a multilateral agreement which achieves the objectives of subparagraph (B).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The President may make a certification under subparagraph (A)(i) with respect to a major drug producing country or drug-transit country which is also a producer of licit opium only if the President determines that such country has taken steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit cultivation and production into the illicit market, maintains production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand, and prevents illicit cultivation and production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining whether to make the certification required by paragraph (1) with respect to a country, the President shall consider the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Have the actions of the government of that country resulted in the maximum reductions in illicit drug production which were determined to be achievable pursuant to section 2291(e)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2492_1_target" name="2492_1">1</a></sup> of title 22? In the case of a major drug producing country, the President shall give foremost consideration, in determining whether to make the certification required by paragraph (1), to whether the government of that country has taken actions which have resulted in such reductions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement measures to enforce in its territory, to the maximum extent possible, the elimination of illicit cultivation and the suppression of illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, as evidenced by seizures of such drugs and substances and of illicit laboratories and the arrest and prosecution of violators involved in the traffic in such drugs and substances significantly affecting the United States?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, the laundering in that country of drug-related profits or drug-related moneys, as evidenced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the enactment and enforcement by that government of laws prohibiting such conduct,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that government entering into, and cooperating under the terms of, mutual legal assistance agreements with the United States governing (but not limited to) money laundering, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the degree to which that government otherwise cooperates with United States law enforcement authorities on anti-money laundering efforts?</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, bribery and other forms of public corruption which facilitate the illicit production, processing, or shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or which discourage the investigation and prosecution of such acts, as evidenced by the enactment and enforcement of laws prohibiting such conduct?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Has that government, as a matter of government policy, encouraged or facilitated the production or distribution of illicit narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Does any senior official of that government engage in, encourage, or facilitate the production or distribution of illicit narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Has that government investigated aggressively all cases in which any member of an agency of the United States Government engaged in drug enforcement activities since January 1, 1985, has been the victim of acts or threats of violence, inflicted by or with the complicity of any law enforcement or other officer of such country or any political subdivision thereof, and has energetically sought to bring the perpetrators of such offense or offenses to justice?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Having been requested to do so by the United States Government, does that government fail to provide reasonable cooperation to lawful activities of United States drug enforcement agents, including the refusal of permission to such agents engaged in interdiction of aerial smuggling into the United States to pursue suspected aerial smugglers a reasonable distance into the airspace of the requested country?</p>
<!-- PDFPage:571 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) Has that government made necessary changes in legal codes in order to enable law enforcement officials to move more effectively against narcotics traffickers, such as new conspiracy laws and new asset seizure laws?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) Has that government expeditiously processed United States extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) Has that government refused to protect or give haven to any known drug traffickers, and has it expeditiously processed extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking made by other countries?</p>
<br class="Q04" />
