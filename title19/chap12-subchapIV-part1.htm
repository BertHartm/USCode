<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Ukraine has taken major steps toward global security by ratifying the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons (START I) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, subsequently turning over the last of its Soviet-era nuclear warheads on June 1, 1996, and agreeing, in 1998, not to assist Iran with the completion of a program to develop and build nuclear breeding reactors, and has fully supported the United States in nullifying the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time, the President finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall request the Commission to initiate an investigation under subsection (a) of this section. If the President further finds that emergency action is necessary, he may take action under sections 2252 and 2253 of this title referred to in subsection (b) of this section as if an affirmative determination of the Commission had been made under subsection (a) of this section. Any action taken by the President under the preceding sentence shall cease to apply (1) if a negative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the Commission's report of such determination is submitted to the President, or (2) if an affirmative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the action taken by the President pursuant to such determination becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petitions to initiate consultations as provided for by safeguard arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition may be filed with the President by an entity described in section 2251(a)(1) of this title requesting the President to initiate consultations provided for by the safeguard arrangements of any agreement entered into under section 2435 of this title with respect to imports of an article which is the product of the country which is the other party to such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the President determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of such article, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall initiate consultations with such country with respect to such imports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions; factors determining existence of market disruption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Communist country&rdquo; means any country dominated or controlled by communism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Imports of an article shall be considered to be increasing rapidly if there has been a significant increase in such imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) during a recent period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The term &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the volume of imports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effect of imports of the merchandise on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles;</p>
