<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 7207. To Extend Nondiscriminatory Treatment (Normal Trade Relations Treatment) to Products of Mongolia and To Implement an Agreement To Eliminate Tariffs on Certain Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Intermediates</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 7207, July 1, 1999, 64 F.R. 36549, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The United States has had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade Relations with Mongolia since 1991 and has provided normal trade relations treatment to the products of Mongolia since that time. I have found Mongolia to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the &ldquo;Trade Act&rdquo;) (19 U.S.C. 2432).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Pursuant to section 2424(b)(1) of Public Law 106&ndash;36 [set out as a note above], and having due regard for the findings of the Congress in section 2424(a) of said Law, I hereby determine that title IV of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2431&ndash;2441) should no longer apply to Mongolia.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. On November 13, 1998, members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including the United States and 21 other major trading countries, announced in the WTO an agreement to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (the &ldquo;Uruguay Round&rdquo;). A similar agreement between the United States and 16 other major trading countries eliminating tariffs on enumerated pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates was implemented for the United States on April 1, 1997, by Proclamation 6982 [not classified to the Code], adding such goods to the scope of the agreement on pharmaceutical products reached at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and reflected in Schedule XX&ndash;United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Schedule XX).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)) authorizes the President to proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX for products that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round, if the United States agrees to such action in a multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO, and after compliance with the consultation and layover requirements of section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524). Section 111(b) also authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications as are necessary to reflect such duty treatment in Schedule XX by means of rectifications thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. On April 29, 1999, pursuant to section 115 of the URAA, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) submitted a report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate (&ldquo;the Committees&rdquo;) that sets forth the proposed tariff eliminations, together with the advice received from the appropriate private sector advisory committee and the United States International Trade Commission regarding the proposed tariff eliminations. During the 60-day period thereafter, the USTR consulted with the Committees on the proposed actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">6. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) [see 19 U.S.C. 1202] the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</p>
<p class="note-body">7. Pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined that Schedule XX should be modified to reflect the implementation by the United States of the multilateral agreement on certain pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates negotiated under the auspices of the WTO. In addition, I have determined that the pharmaceuticals appendix to the HTS should be modified to reflect the duty eliminations provided in such agreement, and to make certain minor technical corrections in the identification of particular products in order to ensure that products are accorded the intended duty treatment.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 2424(b)(2) of Public Law 106&ndash;36, section 111(b) of the URAA, and section 604 of the Trade Act, do hereby proclaim that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment) shall be extended to the products of Mongolia, which shall no longer be subject to title IV of the Trade Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Mongolia shall be effective as of the date of signature of this proclamation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) In order to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated under the auspices of the WTO to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates, and to make technical corrections in the tariff treatment accorded to such products, the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Such modifications to the HTS shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in the Annex for the respective actions taken.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</p>

In 1998, Albania concluded a bilateral investment treaty with the United States. Albania is in the process of acceding to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The extension of unconditional normal trade relations treatment to the products of Albania will permit the United States to avail itself of all rights under the WTO with respect to Albania when that country becomes a member of the WTO.</p>

Georgia has also made considerable progress toward respecting fundamental human rights consistent with the objectives of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the &ldquo;Trade Act&rdquo;) (19 U.S.C. 2431, <em>et seq</em>.).

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Investigation by International Trade Commission; report; publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon request of the President or the United States Trade Representative, upon resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the International Trade Commission (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) shall promptly make an investigation to determine, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, whether market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of subsections (a)(3), (b)(4),<sup><a href="#2436_1_target" name="2436_1">1</a></sup> and (c)(4) of section 2252 of this title shall apply with respect to investigations by the Commission under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall report to the President its determination with respect to each investigation under paragraph (1) and the basis therefor and shall include in each report any dissenting or separate views. If the Commission finds, as a result of its investigation, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, it shall find the amount of the increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such market disruption and shall include such finding in its report to the President. The Commission shall furnish to the President a transcript of the hearings and any briefs which may have been submitted in connection with each investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The report of the Commission of its determination with respect to an investigation under paragraph (1) shall be made at the earliest practicable time, but not later than 3 months after the date on which the petition is filed (or the date on which the request or resolution is received or the motion is adopted, as the case may be). Upon making such report to the President, the Commission shall also promptly make public such report (with the exception of information which the Commission determines to be confidential) and shall cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Affirmative determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any affirmative determination of the Commission under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:554 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such determination shall be treated as an affirmative determination made under section 2251(b) of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) sections 2252 and 2253 of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act of 1988), rather than the provisions of part 1 of subchapter II of this chapter as amended by section 1401 of such Act of 1988, shall apply with respect to the taking of subsequent action, if any, by the President in response to such affirmative determination;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the President may take action under such sections 2252 and 2253 of this title only with respect to imports from the country or countries involved of the article with respect to which the affirmative determination was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such action consists of, or includes, an orderly marketing agreement, such agreement shall be entered into within 60 days after the import relief determination date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Products of Communist countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time, the President finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall request the Commission to initiate an investigation under subsection (a) of this section. If the President further finds that emergency action is necessary, he may take action under sections 2252 and 2253 of this title referred to in subsection (b) of this section as if an affirmative determination of the Commission had been made under subsection (a) of this section. Any action taken by the President under the preceding sentence shall cease to apply (1) if a negative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the Commission's report of such determination is submitted to the President, or (2) if an affirmative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the action taken by the President pursuant to such determination becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petitions to initiate consultations as provided for by safeguard arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition may be filed with the President by an entity described in section 2251(a)(1) of this title requesting the President to initiate consultations provided for by the safeguard arrangements of any agreement entered into under section 2435 of this title with respect to imports of an article which is the product of the country which is the other party to such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the President determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of such article, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall initiate consultations with such country with respect to such imports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions; factors determining existence of market disruption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Communist country&rdquo; means any country dominated or controlled by communism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Imports of an article shall be considered to be increasing rapidly if there has been a significant increase in such imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) during a recent period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The term &ldquo;significant cause&rdquo; refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission, in determining whether market disruption exists, shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the volume of imports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effect of imports of the merchandise on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of like or directly competitive articles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) evidence of disruptive pricing practices, or other efforts to unfairly manage trade patterns.</p>
