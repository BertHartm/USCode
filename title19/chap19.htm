<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rapid growth in the world market for telecommunications products and services is likely to continue for several decades;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the United States can improve prospects for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the growth of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) United States exports of telecommunications products and services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) export-related employment and consumer services in the United States, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the continuance of the technological leadership of the United States,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">by undertaking a program to achieve an open world market for trade in telecommunications products, services, and investment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) most foreign markets for telecommunications products, services, and investment are characterized by extensive government intervention (including restrictive import practices and discriminatory procurement practices) which adversely affect United States exports of telecommunications products and services and United States investment in telecommunications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the open nature of the United States telecommunications market, accruing from the liberalization and restructuring of such market, has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to an increase in imports of telecommunications products and a growing imbalance in competitive opportunities for trade in telecommunications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) unless this imbalance is corrected through the achievement of mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade in telecommunications products and services between the United States and foreign countries, the United States should avoid granting continued open access to the telecommunications products and services of such foreign countries in the United States market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the unique business conditions in the worldwide market for telecommunications products and services caused by the combination of deregulation and divestiture in the United States, which represents a unilateral liberalization of United States trade with the rest of the world, and continuing government intervention in the domestic industries of many other countries create a need to make an exception in the case of telecommunications products and services that should not necessarily be a precedent for legislating specific sectoral priorities in combating the closed markets or unfair foreign trade practices of other countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster the economic and technological growth of, and employment in, the United States telecommunications industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to secure a high quality telecommunications network for the benefit of the people of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop an international consensus in favor of open trade and competition in telecommunications products and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to ensure that countries which have made commitments to open telecommunications trade fully abide by those commitments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to achieve a more open world trading system for telecommunications products and services through negotiation and provision of mutually advantageous market opportunities for United States telecommunications exporters and their subsidiaries in those markets in which barriers exist to free international trade.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In conducting the annual analysis under section 181(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2241), the Trade Representative shall review the operation and effectiveness of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each trade agreement negotiated by reason of this chapter that is in force with respect to the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) every other trade agreement regarding telecommunications products or services that is in force with respect to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In each review conducted under paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall determine whether any act, policy, or practice of the foreign country that has entered into the agreement described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is not in compliance with the terms of such agreement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) otherwise denies, within the context of the terms of such agreement, to telecommunications products and services of United States firms mutually advantageous market opportunities in that foreign country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In conducting reviews under subsection (a) of this section, the Trade Representative shall consider any evidence of actual patterns of trade (including United States exports to a foreign country of telecommunications products and services, including sales and services related to those products) that do not reflect patterns of trade which would reasonably be anticipated to flow from the concessions or commitments of such country based on the international competitive position and export potential of such products and services.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:622 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The Trade Representative shall consult with the United States International Trade Commission with regard to the actual patterns of trade described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action in response to affirmative determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any affirmative determination made by the Trade Representative under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to any act, policy, or practice of a foreign country shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of title III of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.], be treated as an affirmative determination under section 304(a)(1)(A) of such Act [19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)(A)] that such act, policy, or practice violates a trade agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In taking actions under section 301 [19 U.S.C. 2411] by reason of paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall first take those actions which most directly affect trade in telecommunications products and services with the priority foreign country referred to in paragraph (1), unless the Trade Representative determines that actions against other economic sectors would be more effective in achieving compliance by the foreign country with the trade agreement that is the subject of the affirmative determination made under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
