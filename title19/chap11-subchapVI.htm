<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;duty&rdquo; includes the rate and form of any import duty, including but not limited to tariff-rate quotas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;other import restriction&rdquo; includes a limitation, prohibition, charge, or exaction other than duty, imposed on importation or imposed for the regulation of importation. The term does not include any orderly marketing agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;ad valorem&rdquo; includes ad valorem equivalent. Whenever any limitation on the amount by which or to which any rate of duty may be decreased or increased pursuant to a trade agreement is expressed in terms of an ad valorem percentage, the ad valorem amount taken into account for purposes of such limitation shall be determined by the President on the basis of the value of imports of the articles concerned during the most recent representative period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;ad valorem equivalent&rdquo; means the ad valorem equivalent of a specific rate or, in the case of a combination of rates including a specific rate, the sum of the ad valorem equivalent of the specific rate and of the ad valorem rate. The ad valorem equivalent shall be determined by the President on the basis of the value of imports of the article concerned during the most recent representative period. In determining the value of imports, the President shall utilize, to the maximum extent practicable, the standards of valuation contained in section 1401a or 1402&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2481_1_target" name="2481_1">1</a></sup> of this title (as in effect before the effective date of the amendments made by title II of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979) or in section 1401a of this title (as in effect on the effective date of such title II amendments) whichever is applicable to the article concerned during such representative period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) An imported article is &ldquo;directly competitive with&rdquo; a domestic article at an earlier or later stage of processing, and a domestic article is &ldquo;directly competitive with&rdquo; an imported article at an earlier or later stage of processing, if the importation of the article has an economic effect on producers of the domestic <!-- PDFPage:543 -->article comparable to the effect of importation of articles in the same stage of processing as the domestic article. For purposes of this paragraph, the unprocessed article is at an earlier stage of processing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;, as applied to any duty or other import restriction, includes the elimination of any duty or other import restriction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &ldquo;existing&rdquo; means (A) when used, without the specification of any date, with respect to any matter relating to entering into or carrying out a trade agreement or other action authorized by this chapter, existing on the day on which such trade agreement is entered into or such other action is taken; and (B) when used with respect to a rate of duty, the nonpreferential rate of duty (however established, and even though temporarily suspended by Act of Congress or otherwise) set forth in rate column numbered 1 of chapters 1 through 97 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States on the date specified or (if no date is specified) on the day referred to in clause (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A product of a country or area is an article which is the growth, produce, or manufacture of such country or area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The term &ldquo;nondiscriminatory treatment&rdquo; means most-favored-nation treatment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 6914. To Modify the Allocation of Tariff-Rate Quotas for Certain Cheeses</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 6914, Aug. 26, 1996, 61 F.R. 45851, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. On January 1, 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden acceded to the European Communities (EC), and the EC customs union of 12 member countries (&ldquo;EC-12&rdquo;) was enlarged to a customs union of 15 member countries (&ldquo;EC-15&rdquo;). At that time, the EC-12, Austria, Finland, and Sweden withdrew their tariff schedules under the World Trade Organization and applied the common external tariff of the EC-12 to imports into the EC-15. The United States and the EC then entered into negotiations under Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 to compensate the United States for the resulting increase in some tariffs on U.S. exports to Austria, Finland, and Sweden.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. On July 22, 1996, the United States and the EC signed an agreement concluding the negotiations on compensation. To recognize the membership of Austria, Finland, and Sweden in the EC-15, the tariff-rate quota (TRQ) allocations for cheeses from these countries will become part of the total TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be reserved for use by these countries through 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Section 404(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)) authorizes the President to allocate the in-quota quantity of a tariff-rate quota for any agricultural product among supplying countries or customs areas and to modify any allocation as the President determines appropriate. Pursuant to section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the TRQ allocations for cheeses by providing that the TRQ allocations for cheeses from Austria, Finland, and Sweden will become part of the total TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be reserved for use by these countries through 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (&ldquo;Trade Act&rdquo;) (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. The modification of the TRQ allocations for cheeses is such an action.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. In paragraph (3) of Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, I delegated my authority under section 404(d)(3) of the Trade Act [probably means section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, 19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)] to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the USTR to exercise my authority under section 604 of the Trade Act [19 U.S.C. 2483] to embody in the HTS the substance of any action taken by the USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, and section 604 of the Trade Act do proclaim that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Additional U.S. notes to chapter 4 of the HTS are modified as specified in the Annex to this proclamation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The USTR is authorized to exercise my authority under section 604 of the Trade Act [19 U.S.C. 2483] to embody in the HTS the substance of any actions taken by USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA [19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)].</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) This proclamation is effective on the date of signature of this proclamation, and the modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective on the dates that are specified in that Annex.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-first.</p>
