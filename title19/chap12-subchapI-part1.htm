<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2112. Barriers to and other distortions of trade</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; directives; disavowal of prior approval of legislation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade are reducing the growth of foreign markets for the products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, diminishing the intended mutual benefits of reciprocal trade concessions, adversely affecting the United States economy, preventing fair and equitable access to supplies, and preventing the development of open and nondiscriminatory trade among nations. The President is urged to take all appropriate and feasible steps within his power (including the full exercise of the rights of the United States under international agreements) to harmonize, reduce, or eliminate such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. The President is further urged to utilize the authority granted by subsection (b) of this section to negotiate trade agreements with other countries and instrumentalities providing on a basis of mutuality for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prior approval of any legislation which may be necessary to implement an agreement concerning barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presidential determinations prerequisite to entry into trade agreements; trade with Israel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the President determines that any barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade of any foreign country or the United States unduly burden and restrict the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affect the United States economy, or that the imposition of such barriers is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, and that the purposes of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President, during the 13-year period beginning on January 3, 1975, may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers (or other distortions) or providing for the prohibition of or limitations on the imposition of such barriers (or other distortions).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Trade agreements that provide for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) only with Israel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The negotiation of any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States shall take fully into account any product that benefits from a discriminatory preferential tariff arrangement between Israel and a third country if the tariff preference on such product has been the subject of a challenge by the United States Government under the authority of section 2411 of this title and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the requirements of subsections (c) and (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no trade benefit shall be extended to any country by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to another country under a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with such other country that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a trade agreement that provides for the elimination or <!-- PDFPage:430 -->reduction of any duty imposed by the United States may be entered into under paragraph (1) with any country other than Israel if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such country requested the negotiation of such an agreement, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the President, at least 60 days prior to the date notice is provided under subsection (e)(1) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) provides written notice of such negotiations to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) consults with such committees regarding the negotiation of such agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of section 2191 of this title shall not apply to an implementing bill (within the meaning of section 2191(b) of this title) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such implementing bill contains a provision approving of any trade agreement which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) is entered into under this section with any country other than Israel, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the requirements of subparagraph (A) were not met with respect to the negotiation of such agreement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives disapproved of the negotiation of such agreement before the close of the 60-day period which begins on the date notice is provided under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) with respect to the negotiation of such agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The 60-day period described in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii)(II) shall be computed without regard to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the days on which either House of Congress is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain or an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any Saturday and Sunday, not excluded under clause (i), when either House of Congress is not in session.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Presidential consultation with Congress prior to entry into trade agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the President enters into any trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, and with each committee of the House and the Senate and each joint committee of the Congress which has jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such trade agreement. Such consultation shall include all matters relating to the implementation of such trade agreement as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section. If it is proposed to implement such trade agreement, together with one or more other trade agreements entered into under this section, in a single implementing bill, such consultation shall include the desirability and feasibility of such proposed implementation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Submission to Congress of agreements, drafts of implementing bills, and statements of proposed administrative action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President enters into a trade agreement under this section providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of a barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade, he shall submit such agreement, together with a draft of an implementing bill (described in section 2191(b) of this title) and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, to the Congress as provided in subsection (e) of this section, and such agreement shall enter into force with respect to the United States only if the provisions of subsection (e) of this section are complied with and the implementing bill submitted by the President is enacted into law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Steps prerequisite to entry into force of trade agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each trade agreement submitted to the Congress under this subsection shall enter into force with respect to the United States if (and only if)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the President, not less than 90 days before the day on which he enters into such trade agreement, notifies the House of Representatives and the Senate of his intention to enter into such an agreement, and promptly thereafter publishes notice of such intention in the Federal Register;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after entering into the agreement, the President transmits a document to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing a copy of the final legal text of such agreement together with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a draft of an implementing bill and a statement of any administrative action proposed to implement such agreement, and an explanation as to how the implementing bill and proposed administrative action change or affect existing law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a statement of his reasons as to how the agreement serves the interests of United States commerce and as to why the implementing bill and proposed administrative action is required or appropriate to carry out the agreement; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the implementing bill is enacted into law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Obligations imposed upon foreign countries or instrumentalities receiving benefits under trade agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To insure that a foreign country or instrumentality which receives benefits under a trade agreement entered into under this section is subject to the obligations imposed by such agreement, the President may recommend to Congress in the implementing bill and statement of administrative action submitted with respect to such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement apply solely to the parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement. The President may also recommend with respect to any such agreement that the benefits and obligations of such agreement not apply uniformly to all parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the terms of such agreement.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Secretary of Agriculture (hereafter in this section referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) may recommend to the President the imposition of a temporary duty on any Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable entered into the United States if the Secretary determines that both of the following conditions exist at the time that imposition of the duty is recommended:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) For each of 5 consecutive working days the import price of the Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable is below 90 percent of the corresponding 5-year average monthly import price for such fruit or vegetable.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The planted acreage in the United States for the like fresh fruit or vegetable is no higher than the average planted acreage over the preceding 5 years, excluding the years with the highest and lowest acreage. For the purposes of applying this subparagraph, any acreage increase attributed directly to a reduction in the acreage that was planted to wine grapes as of October 4, 1987, shall be excluded.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Whenever the Secretary makes a determination that the conditions referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) regarding any Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable exist, the Secretary shall immediately submit for publication in the Federal Register notice of the determination.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) No later than 6 days after publication in the Federal Register of the notice described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall decide whether to recommend the imposition of a temporary duty to the President, and if the Secretary decides to make such a recommendation, the recommendation shall be forwarded immediately to the President.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In determining whether to recommend the imposition of a temporary duty to the President under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider whether the conditions in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph have led to a distortion in trade between the United States and Canada of the fresh fruit or vegetable and, if so, whether the imposition of the duty is appropriate, including consideration of whether it would significantly correct this distortion.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Not later than 7 days after receipt of a recommendation of the Secretary under paragraph (1), the President, after taking into account the national economic interests of the United States, shall determine whether to impose a temporary duty on the Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable concerned. If the determination is affirmative, the President shall proclaim the imposition and the rate of the temporary duty, but <!-- PDFPage:440 -->such duty shall not apply to the entry of articles that were in transit to the United States on the first day on which the temporary duty is in effect.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to further the environmental and trade policy goals of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. The United States is committed to a policy of careful assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements. The United States will factor environmental considerations into the development of its trade negotiating objectives. Responsible agencies will accomplish these goals through a process of ongoing assessment and evaluation, and, in certain instances, written environmental reviews.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Purpose and Need</em>. Trade agreements should contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development. Environmental reviews are an important tool to help identify potential environmental effects of trade agreements, both positive and negative, and to help facilitate consideration of appropriate responses to those effects whether in the course of negotiations, through other means, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) <em>Implementation</em>. The United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality shall oversee the implementation of this order, including the development of procedures pursuant to this order, in consultation with appropriate foreign policy, environmental, and economic agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Conduct of Environmental Reviews</em>. The Trade Representative, through the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), shall conduct the environ<!-- PDFPage:453 -->mental reviews of the agreements under section 4 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Trade Agreements.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Certain agreements that the United States may negotiate shall require an environmental review. These include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) comprehensive multilateral trade rounds;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) bilateral or plurilateral free trade agreements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) major new trade liberalization agreements in natural resource sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agreements reached in connection with enforcement and dispute resolution actions are not covered by this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) For trade agreements not covered under subsections 4(a) and (b), environmental reviews will generally not be required. Most sectoral liberalization agreements will not require an environmental review. The Trade Representative, through the TPSC, shall determine whether an environmental review of an agreement or category of agreements is warranted based on such factors as the significance of reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Environmental Reviews.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Environmental reviews shall be:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) written;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) initiated through a Federal Register notice, outlining the proposed agreement and soliciting public comment and information on the scope of the environmental review of the agreement;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) undertaken sufficiently early in the process to inform the development of negotiating positions, but shall not be a condition for the timely tabling of particular negotiating proposals;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) made available in draft form for public comment, where practicable; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) made available to the public in final form.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As a general matter, the focus of environmental reviews will be impacts in the United States. As appropriate and prudent, reviews may also examine global and transboundary impacts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Resources</em>. Upon request by the Trade Representative, with the concurrence of the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide analytical and financial resources and support, including the detail of appropriate personnel, to the Office of the United States Trade Representative to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
