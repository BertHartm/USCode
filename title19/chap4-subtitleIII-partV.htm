<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any master of any vessel and any person in charge of any vehicle bound to the United States who does not produce the manifest to the officer (whether of the Customs Service or the Coast Guard) demanding the same shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000, and if any merchandise, including sea stores, is found on board of or after having been unladen from such vessel or vehicle which is not included or described in said manifest or does not agree therewith, the master of such vessel or the person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be liable to a penalty equal to the lesser of $10,000 or the domestic value of the merchandise so found or unladen, and any such merchandise belonging or consigned to the master or other officer or to any of the crew of such vessel, or to the owner or person in charge of such vehicle, shall be subject to forfeiture, and if any merchandise described in such manifest is not found on board the vessel or vehicle the master or other person in charge or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for any discrepancy between the merchandise and said manifest shall be subject to a penalty of $1,000: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Customs Service shall be satisfied that the manifest was lost or mislaid <!-- PDFPage:231 -->without intentional fraud, or was defaced by accident, or is incorrect by reason of clerical error or other mistake and that no part of the merchandise not found on board was unshipped or discharged except as specified in the report of the master, said penalties shall not be incurred. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;clerical error&rdquo; means a nonnegligent, inadvertent, or typographical mistake in the preparation, assembly, or submission (electronically or otherwise) of the manifest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any of such merchandise so found consists of heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for heroin, morphine, cocaine, isonipecaine, or opiate being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $1,000 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for smoking opium, opium prepared for smoking, or marihuana being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $500 for each ounce thereof so found. If any of such merchandise so found consists of crude opium, the master of such vessel or person in charge of such vehicle or the owner of such vessel or vehicle or any person directly or indirectly responsible for crude opium being in such merchandise shall be liable to a penalty of $200 for each ounce thereof so found. Such penalties shall, notwithstanding the proviso in section 1594 of this title (relating to the immunity of vessels or vehicles used as common carriers), constitute a lien upon such vessel which may be enforced by a libel in rem; except that the master or owner of a vessel used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as such common carrier shall not be liable to such penalties and the vessel shall not be held subject to the lien, if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that neither the master nor any of the officers (including licensed and unlicensed officers and petty officers) nor the owner of the vessel knew, and could not, by the exercise of the highest degree of care and diligence, have known, that such narcotic drugs were on board. Clearance of any such vessel may be withheld until such penalties are paid or until a bond, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is given for the payment thereof.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person, by fraud, or negligence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may seek, induce or affect, or attempt to seek, induce, or affect, the payment or credit to that person or others of any drawback claim by means of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any document, written or oral statement, or electronically transmitted data or information, or act which is material and false, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may aid or abet any other person to violate subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Clerical errors or mistakes of fact are not violations of paragraph (1) unless they are part of a pattern of negligent conduct. The mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prepenalty notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service has reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection (a) of this section and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs Service shall issue to the person concerned a written notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty. Such notice shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) inform such person that he shall have a reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral and written, as to why a claim for a monetary penalty should not be issued in the amount stated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Customs Service may not issue a prepenalty notice if the amount of the penalty in the penalty claim issued under paragraph (2) is $1,000 or less. In such cases, the Customs Service may proceed directly with a penalty claim.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No prepenalty notice in which the alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud shall be issued without the prior approval of Customs Headquarters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalty claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any violation of subsection (a) of this section, as alleged in the notice, has occurred. If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the Customs Service shall promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the Customs Service determines that there was a violation, Customs shall issue a written penalty claim to such person. The written penalty claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under clauses (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1)(A). Such person shall have a reasonable opportunity under section 1618 of this title to make representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under section 1618 of this title, the Customs Service shall provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A fraudulent violation of subsection (a) of this section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:244 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Negligence</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A negligent violation of subsection (a) of this section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the 1st violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Repetitive violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Customs Service determines that a repeat negligent violation occurs relating to the same issue, the penalty amount for the 2d violation shall be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the total actual or potential loss of revenue. The penalty amount for each succeeding repetitive negligent violation shall be in an amount not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue. If the same party commits a nonrepetitive violation, that violation shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prior disclosure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of subsection (a) of this section before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the violation resulted from fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest applied under section 6621 of title 26 on the amount of actual revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived during the period that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) begins on the date of the overpayment of the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) ends on the date on which the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Condition affecting penalty limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitations in subparagraph (A) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed under this subsection apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on the claim at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such longer period as the Customs Service may provide), after notice by the Customs Service of its calculation of the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Commencement of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) of this section existed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exclusivity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Penalty claims under this section shall be the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback related violation of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deprivation of lawful revenue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1514 of this title, if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties and taxes resulting from a violation of subsection (a) of this section, the Customs Service shall require that such duties and taxes be restored whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Drawback compliance program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After consultation with the drawback trade community, the Customs Service shall establish a drawback compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest may participate after being certified by the Customs Service under paragraph (2). Participation in the drawback compliance program is voluntary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A party may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program after meeting the general requirements established under the program or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the party and the Customs Service. Certification requirements shall take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program and the volume of claims. In order to be certified, the participant must be able to demonstrate that it&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person claiming any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage, or any interest therein, which has been forfeited and sold under the provisions of this chapter, may at any time within three months after the date of sale apply to the Secretary of the Treasury if the forfeiture and sale was under the customs laws, or to the Commandant of the Coast Guard or the Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, if the forfeiture and sale was under the navigation laws, for a remission of the forfeiture and restoration of the proceeds of such sale, or such <!-- PDFPage:256 -->part thereof as may be claimed by him. Upon the production of satisfactory proof that the applicant did not know of the seizure prior to the declaration or condemnation of forfeiture, and was in such circumstances as prevented him from knowing of the same, and that such forfeiture was incurred without any willful negligence or intention to defraud on the part of the applicant, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, or the Commissioner of Customs may order the proceeds of the sale, or any part thereof, restored to the applicant, after deducting the cost of seizure and of sale, the duties, if any, accruing on the merchandise or baggage, and any sum due on a lien for freight, charges, or contribution in general average that may have been filed. If no application for such remission or restoration is made within three months after such sale, or if the application be denied by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, or the Commissioner of Customs, the proceeds of sale shall be disposed of as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For the payment of all proper expenses of the proceedings of forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, maintaining the custody of the property, advertising and sale, and if condemned by a decree of a district court and a bond for such costs was not given, the costs as taxed by the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For the satisfaction of liens for freight, charges, and contributions in general average, notice of which has been filed with the appropriate customs officer according to law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The residue shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United States.<sup><a href="#1613_1_target" name="1613_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disposition of proceeds in excess of penalty assessed under section 1592</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If merchandise is forfeited under section 1592 of this title, any proceeds from the sale thereof in excess of the monetary penalty finally assessed thereunder and the expenses and costs described in subsection (a)(1) and (2) of this section or subsection (a)(1), (a)(3), or (a)(4) of section 1613b of this title incurred in such sale shall be returned to the person against whom the penalty was assessed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property is seized by the Secretary under law enforced or administered by the Customs Service, or otherwise acquired under section 1605 of this title, and relief from the forfeiture is granted by the Secretary, or his designee, upon terms requiring the deposit or retention of a monetary amount in lieu of the forfeiture, the amount recovered shall be treated in the same manner as the proceeds of sale of a forfeited item.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any judicial or administrative proceeding to forfeit property under any law enforced or administered by the Customs Service or the Coast Guard, the seizure, storage, and other expenses related to the forfeiture that are incurred by the Customs Service or the Coast Guard after the seizure, but before the institution of, or during, the proceedings, shall be a priority claim in the same manner as the court costs and the expenses of the Federal marshal.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Authorize the execution of a term bond the conditions of which shall extend to and cover similar cases of importations over such period of time, not to exceed one year, or such longer period as he may fix when in his opinion special circumstances existing in a particular instance require such longer period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Authorize, to the extent that he may deem necessary, the taking of a consolidated bond (single entry or term), in lieu of separate bonds to assure compliance with two or more provisions of law, regulations, or instructions which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce. A consolidated bond taken pursuant to the authority contained in this subsection shall have the same force and effect in respect of every provision of law, regulation, or instruction for the purposes for which it is required as though separate bonds had been taken to assure compliance with each such provision.</p>

Any bond transmitted to the Customs Service pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system shall have the same force and effect and be binding upon the parties thereto as if such bond were manually executed, signed, and filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit of money or obligation of United States in lieu of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to permit the deposit of money or obligations of the United States, in such amount and upon such conditions as he may by regulation prescribe, in lieu of sureties on any bond required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The increased security and safety concerns that developed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) One concern that has come to light is the vulnerability of the international bridges and tunnels along the United States borders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) It is necessary to ensure that potentially dangerous vehicles are inspected prior to crossing these bridges and tunnels; however, currently these vehicles are not inspected until after they have crossed into the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Establishing Integrated Border Inspection Areas (IBIAs) would address these concerns by inspecting vehicles before they gained access to the infrastructure of international bridges and tunnels joining the United States and Canada.</p>
