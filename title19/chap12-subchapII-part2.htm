If such training allowance paid to such worker for any week of unemployment is less than the amount of the trade readjustment allowance to which he would be entitled if he applied for such allowance, he shall receive, when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance, a trade readjustment allowance for such week equal to such difference.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maximum allowance; deduction for unemployment insurance; additional payments for approved training periods</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A trade readjustment allowance shall not be paid for any week occurring after the close of the 104-week period that begins with the first week following the week in which the adversely affected worker was most recently totally separated from adversely affected employment&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments for such additional weeks may be made only for weeks in such 26-week period during which the individual is participating in such training.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on additional payments for training periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trade readjustment allowance may not be paid for an additional week specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section if the adversely affected worker who would receive such allowance did not make a bona fide application to a training program approved by the Secretary under section 2296 of this title within 210 days after the date of the worker's first certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance issued by the Secretary, or, if later, within 210 days after the date of the worker's total or partial separation referred to in section 2291(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments of amounts payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts payable to an adversely affected worker under sections 2291 to 2294 of this title shall be subject to such adjustment on a week-to-week basis as may be required by section 2292(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or other Federal law, if the benefit year of a worker ends within an extended benefit period, the number of weeks of extended benefits that such worker would, but for this subsection, be entitled to in that extended benefit period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the number of weeks for which the worker was entitled, during such benefit year, to trade readjustment allowances under sections 2291 to 2294 of this title. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;benefit year&rdquo; and &ldquo;extended benefit period&rdquo; shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Week during which worker received on-the-job training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No trade readjustment allowance shall be paid to a worker under sections 2291 to 2294 of this title for any week during which the worker is receiving on-the-job training.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the worker would benefit from appropriate training,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there is a reasonable expectation of employment following completion of such training,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) training approved by the Secretary is reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area vocational education schools, as defined in section 195(2) of the Vocational Education Act of 1963,<sup><a href="#2296_1_target" name="2296_1">1</a></sup> and employers)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2296_2_target" name="2296_2">2</a></sup></p>

Upon such approval, the worker shall be entitled to have payment of the costs of such training (subject to the limitations imposed by this section) paid on his behalf by the Secretary directly or through a voucher system. Insofar as possible, the Secretary shall provide or assure the provision of such training on the job, which shall include related education necessary for the acquisition of skills needed for a position within a particular occupation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The total amount of payments that may be made under paragraph (1) for any fiscal year shall not exceed $80,000,000, except that for fiscal year 1997, the total amount of payments made under paragraph (1) shall not exceed $70,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, during any fiscal year, the Secretary estimates that the amount of funds necessary to pay the costs of training approved under this section will exceed the amount of the limitation imposed under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall decide how the portion of such limitation that has not been expended at the time of such estimate is to be apportioned among the States for the remainder of such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of applying paragraph (1)(C), a reasonable expectation of employment does not require that employment opportunities for a worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of training approved under this paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the costs of training an adversely affected worker are paid by the Secretary under paragraph (1), no other payment for such costs may be made under any other provision of Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No payment may be made under paragraph (1) of the costs of training an adversely affected worker if such costs&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) from any source other than this section, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) any other training program approved by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary is not required under paragraph (1) to pay the costs of any training approved under paragraph (1) to the extent that such costs are paid&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) from any source other than this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Before approving any training to which subparagraph (A) may apply, the Secretary may require that the adversely affected worker enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which the Secretary will not be required to pay under this section the portion of the costs of such training that the worker has reason to believe will be paid under the program, or by the source, described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall not approve a training program if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under this part, or from wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Secretary may approve training for any adversely affected worker who is a member of a group certified under subpart A of this part at any time after the date on which the group is certified under subpart A of this part, without regard to whether such worker has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance to which the worker is entitled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations which set forth the criteria under each of the subparagraphs of paragraph (1) that will be used as the basis for making determinations under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supplemental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, where appropriate, authorize supplemental assistance necessary to defray reasonable transportation and subsistence expenses for separate maintenance when training is provided in facilities which are not within commuting distance of a worker's regular place of residence.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) payments for travel expenses exceeding the prevailing mileage rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment of costs of on-the-job training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay the costs of any on-the-job training of an adversely affected worker that is approved under subsection (a)(1) of this section in equal monthly installments, but the Secretary may pay such costs, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no currently employed worker is displaced by such adversely affected worker (including partial displacement such as a reduction in the hours of nonovertime work, wages, or employment benefits),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such training does not impair existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of training which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the written concurrence of the labor organization concerned has been obtained,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) no other individual is on layoff from the same, or any substantially equivalent, job for which such adversely affected worker is being trained,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the employer has not terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced the workforce of the employer with the intention of filling the vacancy so created by hiring such adversely affected worker,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the job for which such adversely affected worker is being trained is not being created in a promotional line that will infringe in any way upon the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such training is not for the same occupation from which the worker was separated and with respect to which such worker's group was certified pursuant to section 2272 of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the employer certifies to the Secretary that the employer will continue to employ such worker for at least 26 weeks after completion of such training if the worker desires to continue such employment and the employer does not have due cause to terminate such employment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the employer has not received payment under subsection (a)(1) of this section with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by such employer which failed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the employer has not taken, at any time, any action which violated the terms of any certification described in paragraph (8) made by such employer with respect to any <!-- PDFPage:498 -->other on-the-job training provided by such employer for which the Secretary has made a payment under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for unemployment insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A worker may not be determined to be ineligible or disqualified for unemployment insurance or program benefits under this subpart because the individual is in training approved under subsection (a) of this section, because of leaving work which is not suitable employment to enter such training, or because of the application to any such week in training of provisions of State law or Federal unemployment insurance law relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work. The Secretary shall submit to the Congress a quarterly report regarding the amount of funds expended during the quarter concerned to provide training under subsection (a) of this section and the anticipated demand for such funds for any remaining quarters in the fiscal year concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Suitable employment&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;suitable employment&rdquo; means, with respect to a worker, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment, and wages for such work at not less than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage.</p>
