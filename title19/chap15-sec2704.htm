<p class="note-body">This Act, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), probably should be &ldquo;this title&rdquo; meaning title II of Pub. L. 98&ndash;67, Aug. 5, 1983, 97 Stat. 384, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title II to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 2701 of this title and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2706(b) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), was in the original &ldquo;section 216(b)&rdquo; which is classified to section 2705 of this title, but was translated as meaning section 218(b) as the probable intent of Congress. Section 2706(b) was repealed by Pub. L. 101&ndash;382, title II, &sect;211, Aug. 20, 1990, 104 Stat. 655.</p>
