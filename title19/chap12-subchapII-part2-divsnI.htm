<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Such worker, with respect to such week of unemployment, would not be disqualified for extended compensation payable under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 by reason of the work acceptance and job search requirements in section 202(a)(3) of such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) the last day of a period determined by the Secretary to be approved for enrollment after the termination of a waiver issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The worker is unable to participate in training due to the health of the worker, except that a waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation laws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A waiver issued under paragraph (1) shall be effective for not more than 6 months after the date on which the waiver is issued, unless the Secretary determines otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revocation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the trade readjustment allowance payable to an adversely affected worker for a week of total unemployment shall be an amount equal to the most recent weekly benefit amount of the unemployment insurance payable to the worker for a week of total unemployment preceding the worker's first exhaustion of unemployment insurance (as determined for purposes of section 2291(a)(3)(B) of this title) reduced (but not below zero) by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) income that is deductible from unemployment insurance under the disqualifying income provisions of the applicable State law or Federal unemployment insurance law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adversely affected workers who are undergoing training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any adversely affected worker who is entitled to trade readjustment allowances and who is undergoing training approved by the Secretary shall receive for each week in which he is undergoing any such training, a trade readjustment allowance in an amount (computed for such week) equal to the amount computed under subsection (a) of this section or (if greater) the amount of any weekly allowance for such training to which he would be entitled under any other Federal law for the training of workers, if he applied for such allowance. Such trade readjustment allowance shall be paid in lieu of any training allowance to which the worker would be entitled under such other Federal law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deduction from total number of weeks of allowance entitlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a training allowance under any Federal law other than this chapter is paid to an adversely affected worker for any week of unemployment with respect to which he would be entitled (determined without regard to any disqualification under section 2291(b) of this title) to a trade readjustment allowance if he applied for such allowance, each such week shall be deducted from the total number of weeks of trade readjustment allowance otherwise payable to him under section 2293(a) of this title when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance. If such training allowance paid to such worker for any week of unemployment is less than the amount of the trade readjustment allowance to which he would be entitled if he applied for such allowance, he shall receive, when he applies for a trade readjustment allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance, a trade readjustment allowance for such week equal to such difference.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A trade readjustment allowance shall not be paid for any week occurring after the close of the 104-week period (or, in the case of an adversely affected worker who requires a program of remedial education (as described in section 2296(a)(5)(D) of this title) in order to complete training approved for the worker under section 2296 of this title, the 130-week period) that begins with the first week following the week in which the adversely affected worker was most recently totally separated from adversely affected employment&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to which the worker meets the requirements of section 2291(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in order to assist the adversely affected worker to complete training approved for him under section 2296 of this title, and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, payments may be made as trade readjustment allowances for up to 52 additional weeks in the 52-week period that&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments for such additional weeks may be made only for weeks in such 52-week period during which the individual is participating in such training.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on additional payments for training periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trade readjustment allowance may not be paid for an additional week specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section if the adversely affected worker who would receive such allowance did not make a bona fide application to a training program approved by the Secretary under section 2296 of this title within 210 days after the date of the worker's first certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance issued by the Secretary, or, if later, within 210 days after the date of the worker's total or partial separation referred to in section 2291(a)(1) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special adjustments for benefit years ending with extended benefit periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or other Federal law, if the benefit year of a worker ends within an extended benefit period, the number of weeks of extended benefits that such worker would, but for this subsection, be entitled to in that extended benefit period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the number of weeks for which the worker was entitled, during such benefit year, to trade readjustment allowances under this division. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;benefit year&rdquo; and &ldquo;extended benefit period&rdquo; shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Week during which worker received on-the-job training</h4>
