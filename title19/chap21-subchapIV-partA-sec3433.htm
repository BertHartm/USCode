<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of extraordinary challenge committee to obtain information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an extraordinary challenge committee (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;committee&rdquo;) is convened under paragraph 13 of <!-- PDFPage:733 -->article 1904, and the allegations before the committee include a matter referred to in paragraph 13(a)(i) of article 1904, for the purposes of carrying out its functions and duties under Annex 1904.13, the committee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall have access to, and the right to copy, any document, paper, or record pertinent to the subject matter under consideration, in the possession of any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may summon witnesses, take testimony, and administer oaths;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may require any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity to produce documents, books, or records relating to the matter in question; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may require any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity to furnish in writing, in such detail and in such form as the committee may prescribe, information in its possession pertaining to the matter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any member of the committee may sign subpoenas, and members of the committee, when authorized by the committee, may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, take testimony, and receive evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Witnesses and evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The attendance of witnesses who are authorized to be summoned, and the production of documentary evidence authorized to be ordered, under subsection (a) of this section may be required from any place in the United States at any designated place of hearing. In the case of disobedience to a subpoena authorized under subsection (a) of this section, the committee may request the Attorney General of the United States to invoke the aid of any district or territorial court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. Such court, within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on, may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity, issue an order requiring such individual or entity to appear before the committee, or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence concerning the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Mandamus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any court referred to in subsection (b) of this section shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding compliance with the provisions of this section or any order of the committee made in pursuance thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Depositions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The committee may order testimony to be taken by deposition at any stage of the committee review. Such deposition may be taken before any person designated by the committee and having power to administer oaths. Such testimony shall be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition, or under the direction of such person, and shall then be subscribed by the deponent. Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity may be compelled to appear and be deposed and to produce documentary evidence in the same manner as witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the committee, as provided in this section.</p>
