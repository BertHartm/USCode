<p class="note-body">(1) To extend the one-year period prescribed in section 491, <em>supra</em>, as amended [section 1491 of this title], for not more than one year from and after the expiration of such one-year period in any case in which such period has already expired or shall hereafter expire during the continuance of the said national emergency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) To extend the three-year period prescribed in sections 557 and 559, <em>supra</em>, as amended [sections 1557 and 1559 of this title], for not more than one year from and after the expiration of such three-year period in any case in which such period has already expired or shall hereafter expire during the continuance of the said national emergency; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) To extend further the one-year period prescribed in section 491, <em>supra</em>, as amended [section 1491 of this title], and the three-year period prescribed in sections 557 and 559, <em>supra</em>, as amended [sections 1557 and 1559 of this title], for additional periods of not more than one year each from and after the expiration of the immediately preceding extension in any case in which such extension shall expire during the continuance of the said national emergency:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Provided, however</em>, that in each and every case under numbered paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) above in which the merchandise is charged against an entry bond the Secretary of the Treasury shall require that the principal on such bond, in order to obtain the benefit of any extension which may be granted under the authority of this proclamation, shall furnish to the collector of customs at the port where the bond is on file either the agreement of the sureties on the bond to remain bound under the terms and conditions of the bond to the same extent as if no extension had been granted, or an additional bond with acceptable sureties to cover the period of extension; and that, in each and every case in which the merchandise remains charged against a carrier's bond the Secretary of the Treasury shall require that the principal on such bond shall agree to the extension and shall furnish to the collector of customs at the port where the charge was made the agreement of the sureties on the bond to remain bound under the terms and conditions of the bond to the same extent as if no extension had been granted; and</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Provided further</em>, that as a condition to the granting of any extension or further extension of the periods prescribed in sections 491, 557, and 559 of the Tariff Act of 1930, <em>supra</em>, as amended [sections 1491, 1557 and 1559 of this title], under numbered paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) above the Secretary of the Treasury may require that there shall be furnished to the collector of customs in the district in which the warehouse is located, in connection with the application for such extension, the consent of the warehouse proprietor to such extension or, in the alternative, proof of payment of all charges or amounts due or owing to such warehouse proprietor for the storage or handling of the imported merchandise; and</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Provided further</em>, that the extensions of one year authorized by this proclamation shall not apply to any case in which the period sought to be extended expired prior to December 16, 1950, or in which the merchandise in question has been sold by the Government as abandoned.</p>
