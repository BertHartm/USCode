<p class="statutory-body">The President may exercise any powers and duties conferred on him by sections 1356k to 1356n of this title through such agency or officer as he shall direct. The powers and duties conferred by sections 1356k to 1356n of this title shall be exercised in the manner the President considers appropriate to protect the interest of United States consumers. In the event the President determines that there has been an unwarranted increase in the price of coffee due in whole or in part to the International Coffee Agreement, or to market manipulation by two or more members of the International Coffee Organization, the President shall request the International Coffee Council or the Executive Board to increase supplies of coffee available to world markets by suspending coffee export quotas and to take any other appropriate action. At the same time he shall report his determination to the Congress. In the event the International Coffee Council has failed to take corrective action to remedy the situation within a reasonable time after such request, the President shall submit to the Congress such recommendations as he may consider appropriate to correct the situation. In the event that members of the International Coffee Organization involved in market manipulation which has resulted in price increases have failed to remedy the situation within a reasonable time after a request for remedy, the exercise of the authority set forth in section 1356k of this title shall be suspended until the President determines that effective market manipulation activities have ceased.</p>
