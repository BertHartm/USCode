<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Government Procurement Procedures</em>. (a) Waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) With respect to eligible products (as defined in section 381(c) of the NAFTA Implementation Act [amending section 2518(4)(A) of this title]) of Canada and Mexico, and suppliers of such products, the application of any law, regulation, procedure, or practice regarding Federal Government procurement that would, if applied to such products or suppliers, result in treatment less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) to United States products and services and suppliers of such products and services; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) to eligible products of either Mexico or Canada, shall be waived.</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) This order shall apply only to solicitations issued on or after the date of entry into force of the NAFTA for the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Although regulatory implementation of this order must await revisions to the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), it is expected that agencies listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of this order will take all appropriate actions in the interim to implement those aspects of the order that are not dependent upon regulatory revision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Pursuant to section 25 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended ([former] 41 U.S.C. 421(a)) [now 41 U.S.C. 1302, 1303], the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall ensure that the policies established herein are incorporated in the FAR within 30 days from the date this order is issued.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Government Use of Patented Technology</em>.

<p class="note-body-1em">(1) is hereby waived for an invention used or manufactured by or for the Federal Government, except that the patent owner must be notified whenever the agency or its contractor, without making a patent search, knows or has demonstrable reasonable grounds to know that an invention described in and covered by a valid United States patent is or will be used or manufactured without a license; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) is waived whenever a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency exists, except that the patent owner must be notified as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies shall treat the term &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; as used in Articles 1709(10)(h) and (j) and 1715 of the NAFTA as equivalent to &ldquo;reasonable and entire compensation&rdquo; as used in section 1498 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In addition to the general provisions of section 7 of this order regarding enforceable rights, nothing in this order is intended to suggest that the giving of notice to a patent owner under Article 1709(10) of the NAFTA constitutes an admission that the Federal Government has infringed a valid privately-owned patent.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:771 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Future free trade area negotiations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Efforts by the United States to obtain greater market opening through multilateral negotiations have not produced agreements that fully satisfy the trade negotiating objectives of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) United States trade policy should provide for additional mechanisms with which to pursue greater market access for United States exports of goods and services and opportunities for export-related investment by United States persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Among the additional mechanisms should be a system of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that provide greater market access for United States exports and opportunities for export-related investment by United States persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The system of trade agreements can and should be structured to be consistent with, and complementary to, existing international obligations of the United States and ongoing multilateral efforts to open markets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Report on significant market opening</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No later than May 1, 1994, and May 1, 1997, the Trade Representative shall submit to the President, and to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;appropriate Congressional committees&rdquo;), a report which lists those foreign countries&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) currently provide fair and equitable market access for United States exports of goods and services and opportunities for export-related investment by United States persons, beyond what is required by existing multilateral trade agreements or obligations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) have made significant progress in opening their markets to United States exports of goods and services and export-related investment by United States persons; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the further opening of whose markets has the greatest potential to increase United States exports of goods and services and export-related investment by United States persons, either directly or through the establishment of a beneficial precedent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Presidential determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President, on the basis of the report submitted by the Trade Representative under paragraph (2), shall determine with which foreign country or countries, if any, the United States should seek to negotiate a free trade area agreement or agreements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recommendations on future free trade area negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No later than July 1, 1994, and July 1, 1997, the President shall submit to the appropriate Congressional committees a written report that contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) recommendations for free trade area negotiations with each foreign country selected under paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to each country selected, the specific negotiating objectives that are necessary to meet the objectives of the United States under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) legislative proposals to ensure adequate consultation with the Congress and the private sector during the negotiations, advance Congressional approval of the negotiations recommended by the President, and Congressional approval of any trade agreement entered into by the President as a result of the negotiations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) General negotiating objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The general negotiating objectives of the United States under this section are to obtain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) preferential treatment for United States goods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) national treatment and, where appropriate, equivalent competitive opportunity for United States services and foreign direct investment by United States persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the elimination of barriers to trade in goods and services by United States persons through standards, testing, labeling, and certification requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) nondiscriminatory government procurement policies and practices with respect to United States goods and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the elimination of other barriers to market access for United States goods and services, and the elimination of barriers to foreign direct investment by United States persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the elimination of acts, policies, and practices which deny fair and equitable market opportunities, including foreign government toleration of anticompetitive business practices by private firms or among private firms that have the effect of restricting, on a basis that is inconsistent with commercial considerations, purchasing by such firms of United States goods and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights of United States persons, and fair and equitable market access for United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the elimination of foreign export and domestic subsidies that distort international trade in United States goods and services or cause material injury to United States industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the elimination of all export taxes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) the elimination of acts, policies, and practices which constitute export targeting; and</p>
