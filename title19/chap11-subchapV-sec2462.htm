Before the President designates any country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of this subchapter, he shall notify the House of Representatives and the Senate of his intention to make such designation, together with the considerations entering into such decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the President has designated any country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of this subchapter, he shall not terminate such designation (either by issuing an Executive order or Presidential proclamation for that purpose or by issuing an Executive order or Presidential proclamation which has the effect of terminating such designation) unless, at least 60 days before such termination, he has notified the House of Representatives and the Senate and has notified such country of his intention to terminate such designation, together with the considerations entering into such decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;country&rdquo; means any foreign country, any overseas dependent territory or possession of a foreign country, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
