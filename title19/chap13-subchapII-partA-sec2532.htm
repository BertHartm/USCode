<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nondiscriminatory treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Federal agency shall ensure, in applying standards-related activities with respect to any imported product, that such product is treated no less favorably than are like domestic or imported products, including, but not limited to, when applying tests or test methods, no less favorable treatment with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the acceptance of the product for testing in comparable situations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the following apply:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) International standards not appropriate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The reasons for which the basing of a standard on an international standard may not be appropriate include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) National security requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) The prevention of deceptive practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) The protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or the environment.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Performance criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Federal agency shall, if appropriate, develop standards based on performance criteria, such as those relating to the intended use of a product and the level of performance that the product must achieve under defined conditions, rather than on design criteria, such as those relating to the physical form of the product or the types of material of which the product is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Access for foreign suppliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Federal agency shall, with respect to any conformity assessment procedure used by it, permit access for obtaining an assessment of conformity and the mark of the system, if any, to foreign suppliers of a product on the same basis as access is permitted to suppliers of like products, whether of domestic or other foreign origin.</p>
