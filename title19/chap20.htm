<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations on designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall not designate any country a beneficiary country under this chapter&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">a United States citizen or a corporation, partnership, or association, which is 50 percent or more beneficially owned by United States citizens, the effect of which is to nationalize, expropriate, or otherwise seize ownership or control of property so owned, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) has imposed or enforced taxes or other exactions, restrictive maintenance or operational conditions, or other measures with respect to property so owned, the effect of which is to nationalize, expropriate, or otherwise seize ownership or control of such property, unless the President determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has received assurances satisfactory to him that such preferential treatment will be eliminated or that action will be taken to assure that there will be no such significant adverse effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reports those assurances to the Congress;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if a government-owned entity in such country engages in the broadcast of copyrighted material, including films or television material, belonging to United States copyright owners without their express consent or such country fails to work towards the provision of adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the degree to which such country is undertaking self-help measures to protect its own economic development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) whether or not such country has taken or is taking steps to afford to workers in that country (including any designated zone in that country) internationally recognized worker rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the extent to which such country provides under its law adequate and effective means for foreign nationals to secure, exercise, and enforce exclusive rights in intellectual property, including patent, trademark, and copyright rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the extent to which such country prohibits its nationals from engaging in the broadcast of copyrighted material, including films or television material, belonging to United States copyright owners without their express consent;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) withdraw or suspend the designation of any country as a beneficiary country, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under this chapter to any article of any country,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if, after such designation, the President determines that as a result of changed circumstances such a country should be barred from designation as a beneficiary country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The President shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the action the President proposes to take under paragraph (1) at least 30 days before taking such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The United States Trade Representative shall, within the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the President publishes under subparagraph (A) notice of proposed action&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Unless otherwise excluded from eligibility by this chapter, the duty-free treatment provided under this chapter shall apply to any article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that article is imported directly from a beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the cost or value of the materials produced in a beneficiary country or 2 or more beneficiary countries under this chapter, or a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] or 2 or more such countries, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the direct costs of processing operations performed in a beneficiary country or countries (under this chapter or the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of such article at the time it is entered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B), the term &ldquo;beneficiary country&rdquo; includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. If the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) is included with respect to an article to which this paragraph applies, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered that is attributed to such United States cost or value may be applied toward determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out subsection (a) of this section including, but not limited to, regulations providing that, in order to be eligible for duty-free treatment under this chapter, an article must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country, or must be a new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the beneficiary country; but no article or material of a beneficiary country shall be eligible for such treatment by virtue of having merely undergone&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) simple combining or packaging operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) As used in this subsection, the phrase &ldquo;direct costs of processing operations&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such phrase does not include costs which are not directly attributable to the merchandise concerned or are not costs of manufacturing the product, such as (i) profit, and (ii) general expense of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, interest, and salesmen's salaries, commissions or expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the President, pursuant to section 223 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990, considers that the implementation of revised rules of origin for products of beneficiary countries designated under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) would be appropriate, the <!-- PDFPage:664 -->President may include similarly revised rules of origin for products of beneficiary countries designated under this chapter in any suggested legislation transmitted to the Congress that contains such rules of origin for products of beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act.</p>
