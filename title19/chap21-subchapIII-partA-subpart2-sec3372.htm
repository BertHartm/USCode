<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) imports from such country, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) imports from a NAFTA country, considered individually, or in exceptional circumstances imports from NAFTA countries considered collectively, contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, found by the International Trade Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of NAFTA imports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the nature and extent of action to be taken under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.], the President shall exclude from such action imports from a NAFTA country if the President makes a negative determination under subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to imports from such country.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the President may take appropriate action under such chapter 1 to include those imports in the action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any entity that is representative of an industry for which such action is being taken may request the International Trade Commission to conduct an investigation of the surge in such imports.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receiving a request under paragraph (1)(B), the International Trade Commission shall conduct an investigation to determine whether a surge in such imports undermines the effectiveness of the action.
