<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region richly endowed with both natural and human resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous economic potential and of enduring political significance to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the region has experienced the strengthening of democracy as countries in sub-Saharan Africa have taken steps to encourage broader participation in the political process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa have increased their economic growth rates, taken significant steps towards liberalizing their economies, and made progress toward regional economic integration that can have positive benefits for the region;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa averages approximately $500 annually;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) trade and investment, as the American experience has shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic development and for encouraging broader participation in a political process in which political freedom can flourish;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest impact in an economic environment in which trading partners eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage the development of a vibrant private sector that offers individual African citizens the freedom to expand their economic opportunities and provide for their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of the positive economic and political developments under way throughout the region; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of trade and investment for the region as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;274, July 13, 2004, 118 Stat. 820, as amended by Pub. L. 108&ndash;429, title II, &sect;2004(j)(1), Dec. 3, 2004, 118 Stat. 2595, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The African Growth and Opportunity Act [19 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.] (in this section and section 3 referred to as &lsquo;the Act&rsquo;) has helped to spur economic growth and bolster economic reforms in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and has fostered stronger economic ties between the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the United States; as a result, exports from the United States to sub-Saharan Africa reached record levels after the enactment of the Act, while exports from sub-Saharan Africa to the United States have increased considerably.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:832 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Act's eligibility requirements have reinforced democratic values and the rule of law, and have strengthened adherence to internationally recognized worker rights in eligible sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Act has helped to bring about substantial increases in foreign investment in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the textile and apparel sectors, where tens of thousands of new jobs have been created.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) As a result of the Agreement on Textiles and Apparel of the World Trade Organization, under which quotas maintained by WTO member countries on textile and apparel products end on January 1, 2005, sub-Saharan Africa's textile and apparel industry will be severely challenged by countries whose industries are more developed and have greater capacity, economies of scale, and better infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The underdeveloped physical and financial infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa continues to discourage investment in the region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Regional integration establishes a foundation on which sub-Saharan African countries can coordinate and pursue policies grounded in African interests and history to achieve sustainable development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Expanded trade because of the Act has improved fundamental economic conditions within sub-Saharan Africa. The Act has helped to create jobs in the poorest region of the world, and most sub-Saharan African countries have sought to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Agricultural biotechnology holds promise for helping solve global food security and human health crises in Africa and, according to recent studies, has made contributions to the protection of the environment by reducing the application of pesticides, reducing soil erosion, and creating an environment more hospitable to wildlife.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) (A) One of the greatest challenges facing African countries continues to be the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has infected as many as one out of every four people in some countries, creating tremendous social, political, and economic costs. African countries need continued United States financial and technical assistance to combat this epidemic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) More awareness and involvement by governments are necessary. Countries like Uganda, recognizing the threat of HIV/AIDS, have boldly attacked it through a combination of education, public awareness, enhanced medical infrastructure and resources, and greater access to medical treatment. An effective HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment strategy involves all of these steps.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) African countries continue to need trade capacity assistance to establish viable economic capacity, a well-grounded rule of law, and efficient government practices.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress supports&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) a continued commitment to increase trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa and increase investment in sub-Saharan Africa to the benefit of workers, businesses, and farmers in the United States and in sub-Saharan Africa, including by developing innovative approaches to encourage development and investment in sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a reduction of tariff and nontariff barriers and other obstacles to trade between the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the United States, with particular emphasis on reducing barriers to trade in emerging sectors of the economy that have the greatest potential for development;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) development of sub-Saharan Africa's physical and financial infrastructure;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) international efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, other infectious diseases, and serious public health problems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) many of the aims of the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), which include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) reducing poverty and increasing economic growth;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) promoting peace, democracy, security, and human rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) promoting African integration by deepening linkages between African countries and by accelerating Africa's economic and political integration into the rest of the world;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) attracting investment, debt relief, and development assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) promoting trade and economic diversification;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) broadening global market access for United States and African exports;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) improving transparency, good governance, and political accountability;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(H) expanding access to social services, education, and health services with a high priority given to addressing HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, other infectious diseases, and other public health problems;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(I) promoting the role of women in social and economic development by reinforcing education and training and by assuring their participation in political and economic arenas; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(J) building the capacity of governments in sub-Saharan Africa to set and enforce a legal framework, as well as to enforce the rule of law;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) negotiation of reciprocal trade agreements between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries, with the overall goal of expanding trade across all of sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the President seeking to negotiate, with interested eligible sub-Saharan African countries, bilateral trade agreements that provide investment opportunities, in accordance with section 2102(b)(3) of the Trade Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3802(b)(3));</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) efforts by the President to negotiate with the member countries of the Southern African Customs Union in order to provide the opportunity to deepen and make permanent the benefits of the Act while giving the United States access to the markets of these African countries for United States goods and services, by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers, strengthening intellectual property protection, improving transparency, establishing general dispute settlement mechanisms, and investor-state and state-to-state dispute settlement mechanisms in investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) a comprehensive and ambitious trade agreement with the Southern African Customs Union, covering all products and sectors, in order to mature the economic relationship between sub-Saharan African countries and the United States and because such an agreement would deepen United States economic and political ties to the region, lend momentum to United States development efforts, encourage greater United States investment, and promote regional integration and economic growth;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) regional integration among sub-Saharan African countries and business partnerships between United States and African firms; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) economic diversification in sub-Saharan African countries and expansion of trade beyond textiles and apparel.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RECIPROCITY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the preferential market access opportunities for eligible sub-Saharan African countries will be complemented and enhanced if those countries are implementing actively and fully, consistent with any remaining applicable phase-in periods, their obligations under the World Trade Organization, including obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, as well as the other agreements de<!-- PDFPage:833 -->scribed in section 101(d) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d));</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) eligible sub-Saharan African countries should participate in and support mutual trade liberalization in ongoing negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, including by making reciprocal commitments with respect to improving market access for industrial and agricultural goods, and for services, recognizing that such commitments may need to reflect special and differential treatment for developing countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) some of the most pernicious trade barriers against exports by developing countries are the trade barriers maintained by other developing countries; therefore, eligible sub-Saharan African countries will benefit from the reduction of trade barriers in other developing countries, especially in developing countries that represent some of the greatest potential markets for African goods and services; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) all countries should make sanitary and phytosanitary decisions on the basis of sound science.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INTERPRETATION OF TEXTILE AND APPAREL PROVISIONS OF AGOA.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that the executive branch, particularly the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Commerce, should interpret, implement, and enforce the provisions of section 112 of the African Growth and Opportunity Act [19 U.S.C. 3721], relating to preferential treatment of textile and apparel articles, broadly in order to expand trade by maximizing opportunities for imports of such articles from eligible sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 6. DEFINITION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In this Act, the term &lsquo;eligible sub-Saharan African country&rsquo; means an eligible sub-Saharan African country under the African Growth and Opportunity Act [19 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 7. EXTENSION OF AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT.</h4>
<p class="note-body">[Amended sections 2466a, 2466b, and 3721 of this title.]</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 8. ENTRIES OF CERTAIN APPAREL ARTICLES PURSUANT TO THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 514 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1514) or any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury shall liquidate or reliquidate as free of duty and free of any quantitative restrictions, limitations, or consultation levels entries of articles described in subsection (d) made on or after October 1, 2000, and before the date of the enactment of this Act [July 13, 2004].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Requests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Liquidation or reliquidation may be made under subsection (a) with respect to an entry described in subsection (d) only if a request therefor is filed with the Secretary of the Treasury within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and the request contains sufficient information to enable the Secretary to locate the entry or reconstruct the entry if it cannot be located.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment of Amounts Owed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any amounts owed by the United States pursuant to the liquidation or reliquidation of any entry under subsection (a) shall be paid not later than 180 days after the date of such liquidation or reliquidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Entries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The entries referred to in subsection (a) are entries of apparel articles that meet the requirements of section 112 of the African Growth and Opportunity Act [19 U.S.C. 3721], as amended by section 3108 of the Trade Act of 2002 [Pub. L. 107&ndash;210] and this Act.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 9. DEVELOPMENT STUDY AND CAPACITY BUILDING.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall, by not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [July 13, 2004], conduct a study on each eligible sub-Saharan African country, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) identifies sectors of the economy of that country with the greatest potential for growth, including through export sales;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) identifies barriers, both domestically and internationally, that are impeding growth in such sectors; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) makes recommendations on how the United States Government and the private sector can provide technical assistance to that country to assist in dismantling such barriers and in promoting investment in such sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Dissemination of Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall disseminate information in each study conducted under subsection (a) to the appropriate United States agencies for the purpose of implementing recommendations on the provision of technical assistance and in identifying opportunities for United States investors, businesses, and farmers.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 10. ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT INCREASING TRADE CAPACITY AND ECOTOURISM.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Ecotourism, which consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) responsible and sustainable travel and visitation to relatively undisturbed natural areas in order to enjoy and appreciate nature (and any accompanying cultural features, both past and present) and animals, including species that are rare or endangered,</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) promotion of conservation and provision for beneficial involvement of local populations, and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) visitation designed to have low negative impact upon the environment,</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">is expected to expand 30 percent globally over the next decade.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Ecotourism will increase trade capacity by sustaining otherwise unsustainable infrastructure, such as road, port, water, energy, and telecommunication development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the United States Department of State and the United Nations Environment Programme, sustainable tourism, such as ecotourism, can be an important part of the economic development of a region, especially a region with natural and cultural protected areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Sub-Saharan Africa enjoys an international comparative advantage in ecotourism because it features extensive protected areas that host a variety of ecosystems and traditional cultures that are major attractions for nature-oriented tourism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) National parks and reserves in sub-Saharan Africa should be considered a basis for regional development, involving communities living within and adjacent to them and, given their strong international recognition, provide an advantage in ecotourism marketing and promotion.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Desert areas in sub-Saharan Africa represent complex ecotourism attractions, showcasing natural, geological, and archaeological features, and nomad and other cultures and traditions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Many natural zones in sub-Saharan Africa cross the political borders of several countries; therefore, transboundary cooperation is fundamental for all types of ecotourism development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The commercial viability of ecotourism is enhanced when small and medium enterprises, particularly microenterprises, successfully engage with the tourism industry in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Adequate capacity building is an essential component of ecotourism development if local communities are to be real stakeholders that can sustain an equitable approach to ecotourism management.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Ecotourism needs to generate local community benefits by utilizing sub-Saharan Africa's natural heritage, parks, wildlife reserves, and other protected areas that can play a significant role in encouraging local economic development by sourcing food and other locally produced resources.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:834 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Action by the President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall develop and implement policies to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) encourage the development of infrastructure projects that will help to increase trade capacity and a sustainable ecotourism industry in eligible sub-Saharan African countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) encourage and facilitate transboundary cooperation among sub-Saharan African countries in order to facilitate trade;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) encourage the provision of technical assistance to eligible sub-Saharan African countries to establish and sustain adequate trade capacity development; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) encourage micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in eligible sub-Saharan African countries to participate in the ecotourism industry.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 11. ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY, AGRICULTURE, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In order to increase exports from, and trade among, eligible sub-Saharan African countries, transportation systems in those countries must be improved to increase transport efficiencies and lower transport costs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Vibrant economic growth requires a developed telecommunication and energy infrastructure.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Preferential treatment conditioned on enforcement measures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The preferential treatment under section 3721(a) of this title shall not be provided to textile and apparel articles that are imported from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country unless that country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has adopted an effective visa system, domestic laws, and enforcement procedures applicable to covered articles to prevent unlawful transshipment of the articles and the use of counterfeit documents relating to the importation of the articles into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has enacted legislation or promulgated regulations that would permit United States Customs Service verification teams to have the access necessary to investigate thoroughly allegations of transshipment through such country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) agrees to report, on a timely basis, at the request of the United States Customs Service, on the total exports from and imports into that country of covered articles, consistent with the manner in which the records are kept by that country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) will cooperate fully with the United States to address and take action necessary to prevent circumvention as provided in Article 5 of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) agrees to require all producers and exporters of covered articles in that country to maintain complete records of the production and the export of covered articles, including materials used in the production, for at least 2 years after the production or export (as the case may be); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) agrees to report, on a timely basis, at the request of the United States Customs Service, documentation establishing the country of origin of covered articles as used <!-- PDFPage:843 -->by that country in implementing an effective visa system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Country of origin documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(F), documentation regarding the country of origin of the covered articles includes documentation such as production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, the number of workers employed in production, and certification from both the manufacturer and the exporter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Customs procedures and enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any importer that claims preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title shall comply with customs procedures similar in all material respects to the requirements of Article 502(1) of the NAFTA as implemented pursuant to United States law, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In order to qualify for the preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title and for a Certificate of Origin to be valid with respect to any article for which such treatment is claimed, there shall be in effect a determination by the President that each country described in clause (ii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) has implemented and follows; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is making substantial progress toward implementing and following,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;procedures and requirements similar in all material respects to the relevant procedures and requirements under chapter 5 of the NAFTA.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">A country is described in this clause if it is a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) from which the article is exported; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in which materials used in the production of the article originate or in which the article or such materials, undergo production that contributes to a claim that the article is eligible for preferential treatment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certificate of Origin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Certificate of Origin that otherwise would be required pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) shall not be required in the case of an article imported under section 3721 of this title if such Certificate of Origin would not be required under Article 503 of the NAFTA (as implemented pursuant to United States law), if the article were imported from Mexico.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Penalties for exporters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President determines, based on sufficient evidence, that an exporter has engaged in transshipment as defined in paragraph (4), then the President shall deny for a period of 5 years all benefits under section 3721 of this title to such exporter, any successor of such exporter, and any other entity owned or operated by the principal of the exporter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transshipment described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Transshipment within the meaning of this subsection has occurred when preferential treatment for a textile or apparel article under this chapter&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3722_1_target" name="3722_1">1</a></sup> has been claimed on the basis of material false information concerning the country of origin, manufacture, processing, or assembly of the article or any of its components. For purposes of this paragraph, false information is material if disclosure of the true information would mean or would have meant that the article is or was ineligible for preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Monitoring and reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Customs Service shall monitor and the Commissioner of Customs shall submit to Congress, not later than March 31 of each year, a report on the effectiveness of the visa systems and the implementation of legislation and regulations described in subsection (a) of this section and on measures taken by countries in sub-Saharan Africa which export textiles or apparel to the United States to prevent circumvention as described in Article 5 of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many of the world's poorest countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Until recently, the United States Government and other official creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt reduction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their capacity to repay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the international community that all multilateral and bilateral creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to address concerns raised about country conditionality, the amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation in the world's poorest countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of the Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Congress and the President should work together, without undue delay and in concert with the international community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and poverty alleviation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) this program of debt relief should also support the adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits are shared widely among the population, such as through initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken into account;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict or spends excessively on its military; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3735. Expansion of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commercial Service&rdquo;) plays an important role in helping United States businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals providing services in eight countries. By early 1997, that presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established posts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater United States export activity in those markets, and similar encouragement should be provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:847 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage the export of United States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration shall make a special effort to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) hold discussions with appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan Africa on the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for United States exporters of goods and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or personnel to that region; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years after May 18, 2000.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use of sustainable development assistance to support further economic growth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon the development of a receptive environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve this objective the United States Agency for International Development should continue to support programs which help to create this environment. Investments in human resources, development, and implementation of free market policies, including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and improve food security, and the support for the rule of law and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declarations of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following declarations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Development Fund for Africa established under chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293 et seq.) has been an effective tool in providing development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa since 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Development Fund for Africa will complement the other provisions of this chapter and lay a foundation for increased trade and investment opportunities between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Assistance provided through the Development Fund for Africa will continue to support programs and activities that promote the long term economic development of sub-Saharan Africa, such as programs and activities relating to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Strengthening primary and vocational education systems, especially the acquisition of middle-level technical skills for operating modern private businesses and the introduction of college level business education, including the study of international business, finance, and stock exchanges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Strengthening health care systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Supporting democratization, good governance and civil society and conflict resolution efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Increasing food security by promoting the expansion of agricultural and agriculture-based industrial production and productivity and increasing real incomes for poor individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Promoting an enabling environment for private sector-led growth through sustained economic reform, privatization programs, and market-led economic activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Promoting decentralization and local participation in the development process, especially linking the rural production sectors and the industrial and market centers throughout Africa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Increasing the technical and managerial capacity of sub-Saharan African individuals to manage the economy of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Ensuring sustainable economic growth through environmental protection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The African Development Foundation has a unique congressional mandate to empower the poor to participate fully in development and to increase opportunities for gainful employment, poverty alleviation, and more equitable income distribution in sub-Saharan Africa. The African Development Foundation has worked successfully to enhance the role of women as agents of change, strengthen the informal sector with an emphasis on supporting micro and small sized enterprises, indigenous technologies, and mobilizing local financing. The African Development Foundation should develop and implement strategies for promoting participation in the socioeconomic development process of grassroots and informal sec<!-- PDFPage:848 -->tor groups such as nongovernmental organizations, cooperatives, artisans, and traders into the programs and initiatives established under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Sustained economic development in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon successful trade with and foreign assistance to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The HIV/AIDS crisis has reached epidemic proportions in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 21,000,000 men, women, and children are infected with HIV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Eighty-three percent of the estimated 11,700,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS worldwide have been in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is weakening the structure of families and societies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) The HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the future of the workforce in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Studies show that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa most severely affects individuals between the ages of 15 and 49&mdash;the age group that provides the most support for the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Clear evidence demonstrates that HIV/AIDS is destructive to the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Sustained economic development is critical to creating the public and private sector resources in sub-Saharan Africa necessary to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of the Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa should be a central component of United States foreign policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) significant progress needs to be made in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in order to sustain a mutually beneficial trade relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is a global threat that merits further attention through greatly expanded public, private, and joint public-private efforts, and through appropriate United States legislation.</p>
