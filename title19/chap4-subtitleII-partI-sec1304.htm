<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Marking of articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as hereinafter provided, every article of foreign origin (or its container, as provided in subsection (b) hereof) imported into the United States shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of the article. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Determine the character of words and phrases or abbreviations thereof which shall be acceptable as indicating the country of origin and prescribe any reasonable method of marking, whether by printing, stenciling, stamping, branding, labeling, or by any other reasonable method, and a conspicuous place on the article (or container) where the marking shall appear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Require the addition of any other words or symbols which may be appropriate to prevent deception or mistake as to the origin of the article or as to the origin of any other article with which such imported article is usually combined subsequent to importation but before delivery to an ultimate purchaser; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Authorize the exception of any article from the requirements of marking if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such article is incapable of being marked;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States without injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States, except at an expense economically prohibitive of its importation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The marking of a container of such article will reasonably indicate the origin of such article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Such article is a crude substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Such article is imported for use by the importer and not intended for sale in its imported or any other form;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Such article is to be processed in the United States by the importer or for his account otherwise than for the purpose of concealing the origin of such article and in such manner that any mark contemplated by this section would necessarily be obliterated, destroyed, or permanently concealed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) An ultimate purchaser, by reason of the character of such article or by reason of the circumstances of its importation, must necessarily know the country of origin of such article even though it is not marked to indicate its origin;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Such article was produced more than twenty years prior to its importation into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) Such article is of a class or kind with respect to which the Secretary of the Treasury has given notice by publication in the weekly Treasury Decisions within two years <!-- PDFPage:61 -->after July 1, 1937, that articles of such class or kind were imported in substantial quantities during the five-year period immediately preceding January 1, 1937, and were not required during such period to be marked to indicate their origin: <em>Provided</em>, That this subdivision shall not apply after September 1, 1938, to sawed lumber and timbers, telephone, trolley, electric-light, and telegraph poles of wood, and bundles of shingles; but the President is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of this proviso if he finds such action required to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of sections 1351, 1352, 1353, 1354 of this title, as extended; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) Such article cannot be marked after importation except at any expense which is economically prohibitive, and the failure to mark the article before importation was not due to any purpose of the importer, producer, seller, or shipper to avoid compliance with this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an article is excepted under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section from the requirements of marking, the immediate container, if any, of such article, or such other container or containers of such article as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be marked in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of such article, subject to all provisions of this section, including the same exceptions as are applicable to articles under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section. If articles are excepted from marking requirements under clause (F), (G), or (H) of subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, their usual containers shall not be subject to the marking requirements of this section.
