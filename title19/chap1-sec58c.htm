Before making recommendations regarding any such adjustments, the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide adequate opportunity for public comment. The recommendations shall, as precisely as possible, propose fees which reflect the actual costs to the United States Government for the commercial services provided by the United States Customs Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) There is created within the general fund of the Treasury a separate account that shall be known as the &ldquo;Customs Commercial and Homeland Security Automation Account&rdquo;.
