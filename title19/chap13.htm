<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall, with respect to procurement covered by the Agreement, prohibit the procurement, after the date on which any waiver under section 2511(a) of this title first takes effect, of products&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) which are products of a foreign country or instrumentality which is not designated pursuant to section 2511(b) of this title, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:568 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) which would otherwise be eligible products; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may, with respect to procurement covered by the Agreement, take such other actions within the President's authority as the President deems necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of procurements for which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there are no offers of products or services of the United States or of eligible products; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the offers of products or services of the United States or of eligible products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the United States Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deferrals and waivers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, but in furtherance of the objective of encouraging countries to become parties to the Agreement and provide appropriate reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities to United States products and suppliers of such products, the President may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) waive the prohibition required by subsection (a)(1) of this section on procurement of products of a foreign country or instrumentality which has not yet become a party to the Agreement but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has agreed to apply transparent and competitive procedures to its government procurement equivalent to those in the Agreement, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize the Secretary of Defense to waive, subject to interagency review and policy guidance by the organization established under section 1872(a) of this title, such prohibition for products of any country or instrumentality which enters into a reciprocal procurement agreement with the Department of Defense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before exercising the waiver authority under paragraph (1), the President shall consult with the appropriate private sector advisory committees established under section 2155 of this title and with the appropriate committees of the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report on impact of restrictions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Impact on the economy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On or before July 1, 1981, the President shall report to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate on the effects on the United States economy (including effects on employment, production, competition, costs and prices, technological development, export trade, balance of payments, inflation, and the Federal budget) of the refusal of developed countries to allow the Agreement to cover the entities of the governments of such countries which are the principal purchasers of goods and equipment in appropriate product sectors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recommendations for attaining reciprocity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The report required by paragraph (1) shall include an evaluation of alternative means to obtain equity and reciprocity in such product sectors, including (A) prohibiting the procurement of products of such countries by United States entities not covered by the Agreement, and (B) modifying the application of title III of the Act of March 3, 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.), commonly referred to as the Buy American Act. The report shall include an analysis of the effect of such alternative means on the United States economy (including effects on employment, production, competition, costs and prices, technological development, export trade, balance of payments, inflation, and the Federal budget), and on successful negotiations on the expansion of the coverage of the Agreement pursuant to section 2514(a) and (b) of this title, other trade negotiating objectives, the relationship of the Federal Government to State and local governments, and such other factors as the President deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the preparation of the report required by paragraph (1) and the evaluation and analysis required by paragraph (2), the President shall consult with representatives of the public, industry, and labor, and make available pertinent, nonconfidential information obtained in the course of such preparation to the advisory committees established pursuant to section 2155 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Proposed action</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Presidential report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On or before October 1, 1981, the President shall prepare and transmit to the congressional committees referred to in subsection (c)(1) of this section a report which describes the actions he deems appropriate to establish reciprocity with major industrialized countries in the area of Government procurement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Presidential determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the President determines that any changes in existing law or new statutory authority are required to authorize or to implement any action proposed in the report submitted under paragraph (1), he shall, on or after January 1, 1982, submit to the Congress a bill to accomplish such changes or provide such new statutory authority. Prior to submitting such a bill, the President shall consult with the appropriate committees of the Congress having jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters which would be affected by such action, and shall submit to such committees a proposed draft of such bill.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:569 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Congressional consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The appropriate committee of each House of the Congress shall give a bill submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) prompt consideration and shall make its best efforts to take final committee action on such bill in an expeditious manner.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Overall negotiating objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall seek in the renegotiations provided for in article XXIV(7) of the Agreement more open and equitable market access abroad, and the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of devices which distort trade or commerce related to Government procurement, with the overall goal of maximizing the economic benefit to the United States through maintaining and enlarging foreign markets for products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, the development of fair and equitable market opportunities, and open and nondiscriminatory world trade. In carrying out the provisions of this subsection, the President shall consider the assessment made in the report required under section 2516(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2514_1_target" name="2514_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sector negotiating objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall seek, consistent with the overall objective set forth in subsection (a) of this section and to the maximum extent feasible, with respect to appropriate product sectors, competitive opportunities for the export of United States products to the developed countries of the world equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded by the United States, taking into account all barriers to, and other distortions of, international trade affecting that sector.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Independent verification objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall seek to establish in the renegotiation provided for in article XXIV(7) of the Agreement a system for independent verification of information provided by parties to the Agreement to the Committee on Government Procurement pursuant to article XIX(5) of the Agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reports on negotiations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report in the event of inadequate progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, during the renegotiations of the Agreement, the President at any time determines that the renegotiations are not progressing satisfactorily and are not likely to result, within twelve months of the commencement thereof, in an expansion of the Agreement to cover purchases by the entities of the governments of developed countries which are the principal purchasers of goods and equipment in appropriate product sectors, he shall so report to the congressional committees referred to in section 2512(c)(1) of this title.

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) International standards not appropriate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The reasons for which the basing of a standard on an international standard may not be appropriate include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Access for foreign suppliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Federal agency shall, with respect to any conformity assessment procedure used by it, permit access for obtaining an assessment of conformity and the mark of the system, if any, to foreign suppliers of a product on the same basis as access is permitted to suppliers of like products, whether of domestic or other foreign origin.</p>
