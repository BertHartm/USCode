<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 101. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Government of the United States extended full diplomatic recognition to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1922.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Government of the United States entered into agreements extending most-favored-nation treatment with the Government of Estonia on August 1, 1925, the Government of Latvia on April 30, 1926, and the Government of Lithuania on July 10, 1926.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics incorporated Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania involuntarily into the Union as a result of a secret protocol to a German-Soviet agreement in 1939 which assigned those three states to the Soviet sphere of influence; and the Government of the United States has at no time recognized the forcible incorporation of those states into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 [see Short Title of 1951 Amendment note set out under section 1654 of this title] required the President to suspend, withdraw, or prevent the application of trade benefits, including most-favored-nation treatment, to countries under the domination or control of the world Communist movement.</p>
