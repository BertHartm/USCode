<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region richly endowed with both natural and human resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous economic potential and of enduring political significance to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the region has experienced the strengthening of democracy as countries in sub-Saharan Africa have taken steps to encourage broader participation in the political process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa have increased their economic growth rates, taken significant steps towards liberalizing their economies, and made progress toward regional economic integration that can have positive benefits for the region;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa averages approximately $500 annually;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) trade and investment, as the American experience has shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic development and for encouraging broader participation in a political process in which political freedom can flourish;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest impact in an economic environment in which trading partners eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage the development of a vibrant private sector that offers individual African citizens the freedom to expand their economic opportunities and provide for their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of the positive economic and political developments under way throughout the region; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of trade and investment for the region as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
