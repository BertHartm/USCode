<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section was derived from R.S. &sect;3087, which, however, contained a further provision requiring collectors to cause suits to be commenced without delay and prosecuted to effect. That provision was omitted as inconsistent with section 604 of act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, 42 Stat. 984, constituting former section 511 of this title. Act Sept. 21, 1922, was repealed by act June 17, 1930, but section 604 of the latter Act, constituting section 1604 of this title, reenacted section 604 of the former Act.</p>
