<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;200, title II, &sect;202, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 275, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] (in this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note above] referred to as &lsquo;CBERA&rsquo;) represents a permanent commitment by the United States to encourage the development of strong democratic governments and revitalized economies in neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1998, Hurricane Mitch and Hurricane Georges devastated areas in the Caribbean Basin region, killing more than 10,000 people and leaving 3,000,000 homeless.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The total direct impact of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges on Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala amounts to $4,200,000,000, representing a severe loss to income levels in this underdeveloped region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In addition to short term disaster assistance, United States policy toward the region should focus on expanding international trade with the Caribbean Basin region as an enduring solution for successful economic growth and recovery.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (in this title referred to as &lsquo;FTAA&rsquo;) by the year 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin countries will preserve the United States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, promote the growth of free enterprise and economic opportunity in these neighboring countries, and thereby enhance the national security interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Given the greater propensity of countries located in the Western Hemisphere to use United States components and to purchase United States products compared to other countries, increased trade and economic activity between the United States and countries in the Western Hemisphere will create new jobs in the United States as a result of expanding export opportunities.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to prepare to become a party to the FTAA or another free trade agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the CBERA; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries in the FTAA or another free <!-- PDFPage:703 -->trade agreement at the earliest possible date, with the goal of achieving full participation in such agreement not later than 2005.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Meetings of Trade Ministers and USTR</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;200, title II, &sect;213, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 288, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Schedule of Meetings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall take the necessary steps to convene a meeting with the trade ministers of the CBTPA beneficiary countries in order to establish a schedule of regular meetings, to commence as soon as is practicable, of the trade ministers and the Trade Representative, for the purpose set forth in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of the meetings scheduled under subsection (a) is to reach agreement between the United States and CBTPA beneficiary countries on the likely timing and procedures for initiating negotiations for CBTPA beneficiary countries to enter into mutually advantageous free trade agreements with the United States that contain provisions comparable to those in the NAFTA and would make substantial progress in achieving the negotiating objectives set forth in section 108(b)(5) of Public Law 103&ndash;182 (19 U.S.C. 3317(b)(5)).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &lsquo;CBTPA beneficiary country&rsquo; has the meaning given that term in section 213(b)(5)(B) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(5)(B)].&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 101&ndash;382, title II, &sect;202, Aug. 20, 1990, 104 Stat. 655, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) a stable political and economic climate in the Caribbean region is necessary for the development of the countries in that region and for the security and economic interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [this chapter] was enacted in 1983 to assist in the achievement of such a climate by stimulating the development of the export potential of the region; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the commitment of the United States to the successful development of the region, as evidenced by the enactment of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, should be reaffirmed, and further strengthened, by amending that Act to improve its operation.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 111&ndash;171, &sect;2, May 24, 2010, 124 Stat. 1194, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On January 12, 2010, Haiti was hit by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, the worst earthquake to affect Haiti in recorded history. Aftershocks from the earthquake, measuring up to 6.0 on the Richter scale, continued for days afterwards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The earthquake has devastated Haiti's infrastructure, including homes, offices, factories, roads, ports, communications, and other facilities. The loss of life attributable to the earthquake was massive.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, ranking 149 out of 182 countries according to the United Nation's Human Development Index.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In recent years, however, the Government and people of Haiti had taken important steps forward to promote economic growth and development, including making strides towards establishing a competitive apparel sector.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) United States trade preference programs, including the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] (as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act [Pub. L. 106&ndash;200, title II, see Tables for classification], the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 [Pub. L. 109&ndash;432, div. D, title V, see Tables for classification], and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 [Pub. L. 110&ndash;234, title XV, subtitle D, part I, and Pub. L. 110&ndash;246, title XV, subtitle D, part I, see Tables for classification]), which extend duty-free tariff treatment to certain apparel produced in Haiti, have made an important contribution to Haiti's economic development efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) However, the Haitian apparel sector has been hard hit by the January 12, 2010, earthquake. A number of apparel factories based in and around Port-au-Prince have been heavily damaged, including the collapse of one major apparel factory that had employed nearly 4,000 workers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Port-au-Prince seaport that had served the apparel trade has been badly damaged. And extensive damage to roads has made it difficult to transport apparel to the Dominican Republic for shipment from ports in that country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, imports of apparel articles from Haiti to <!-- PDFPage:737 -->the United States in 2010 have decreased by 43 percent as compared to the same period in 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The earthquake has increased significantly the costs and uncertainty of doing business in Haiti. A strong and unequivocal commitment from the United States is needed to help Haiti offset these costs and preserve the gains made under United States trade preference programs, and to encourage buyers and investors to stand with Haiti through this crisis.&rdquo;</p>
