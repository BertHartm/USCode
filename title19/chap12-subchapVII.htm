<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) in satisfying the goals agreed to in an applicable bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States (as described in paragraph (B)) or a multilateral agreement which achieves the objectives of paragraph (B),</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a country that would not otherwise qualify for certification under clause (i), the vital national interests of the United States require that subsection (a) of this section not be applied with respect to that country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A bilateral narcotics agreement referred to in subparagraph (A)(i)(I) is an agreement between the United States and a foreign country in which the foreign country agrees to take specific activities, including, where applicable, efforts to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) reduce drug production, drug consumption, and drug trafficking within its territory, including activities to address illicit crop eradication and crop substitution;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A country which in the previous year was designated as a major drug producing country or a major drug-transit country may not be determined to be cooperating fully under subparagraph (A)(i) unless it has in place a bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States or a multilateral agreement which achieves the objectives of subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the President makes a certification with respect to a country pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii), he shall include in such certification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a full and complete description of the vital national interests placed at risk if action is taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section with respect to that country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a statement weighing the risk described in clause (i) against the risks posed to the vital national interests of the United States by the failure of such country to cooperate fully with the United States in combating narcotics or to take adequate steps to combat narcotics on its own.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The President may make a certification under subparagraph (A)(i) with respect to a major drug producing country or drug-transit country which is also a producer of licit opium only if the President determines that such country has taken steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit cultivation and production into the illicit market, maintains production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand, and prevents illicit cultivation and production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining whether to make the certification required by paragraph (1) with respect to a country, the President shall consider the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Have the actions of the government of that country resulted in the maximum reductions in illicit drug production which were determined to be achievable pursuant to section 2291(e)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2492_1_target" name="2492_1">1</a></sup> of title 22? In the case of a major drug producing country, the President shall give foremost consideration, in determining whether to make the certification required by paragraph (1), to whether the government of that country has taken actions which have resulted in such reductions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement measures to enforce in its territory, to the maximum extent possible, the elimination of illicit cultivation and the suppression of illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, as evidenced by seizures of such drugs and substances and of illicit laboratories and the arrest and prosecution of violators involved in the traffic in such drugs and substances significantly affecting the United States?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, the laundering in that country of drug-related profits or drug-related moneys, as evidenced by&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:596 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the enactment and enforcement by that government of laws prohibiting such conduct,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that government entering into, and cooperating under the terms of, mutual legal assistance agreements with the United States governing (but not limited to) money laundering, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the degree to which that government otherwise cooperates with United States law enforcement authorities on anti-money laundering efforts?</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, bribery and other forms of public corruption which facilitate the illicit production, processing, or shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or which discourage the investigation and prosecution of such acts, as evidenced by the enactment and enforcement of laws prohibiting such conduct?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Has that government, as a matter of government policy, encouraged or facilitated the production or distribution of illicit narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Does any senior official of that government engage in, encourage, or facilitate the production or distribution of illicit narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Has that government investigated aggressively all cases in which any member of an agency of the United States Government engaged in drug enforcement activities since January 1, 1985, has been the victim of acts or threats of violence, inflicted by or with the complicity of any law enforcement or other officer of such country or any political subdivision thereof, and has energetically sought to bring the perpetrators of such offense or offenses to justice?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Having been requested to do so by the United States Government, does that government fail to provide reasonable cooperation to lawful activities of United States drug enforcement agents, including the refusal of permission to such agents engaged in interdiction of aerial smuggling into the United States to pursue suspected aerial smugglers a reasonable distance into the airspace of the requested country?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) Has that government made necessary changes in legal codes in order to enable law enforcement officials to move more effectively against narcotics traffickers, such as new conspiracy laws and new asset seizure laws?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) Has that government expeditiously processed United States extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking?</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) Has that government refused to protect or give haven to any known drug traffickers, and has it expeditiously processed extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking made by other countries?</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subsection (a) of this section shall apply to a country without regard to paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Congress enacts, within 45 days of continuous session after receipt of a certification under paragraph (1), a joint resolution disapproving the determination of the President contained in that certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the President takes action under subsection (a) of this section, that action shall remain in effect until&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the President submits at any other time a certification of the matters described in paragraph (1) with respect to that country, a period of 45 days of continuous session of Congress elapses, and during that period the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of disapproving the determination contained in that certification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions under paragraphs (3) and (4)&mdash;</p>
