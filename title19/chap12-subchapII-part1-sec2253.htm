<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any action described in subsection (a)(3)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, that is taken under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall take effect within 15 days after the day on which the President proclaims the action, unless the President announces, on the date he decides to take such action, his intention to negotiate one or more agreements described in subsection (a)(3)(E) of this section in which case the action under subsection (a)(3)(A), (B), or (C) of this section shall be proclaimed and take effect within 90 days after the date of such decision.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitations on actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the duration of the period in which an action taken under this section may be in effect shall not exceed 4 years.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) An action described in subsection (a)(3)(A), (B), or (C) of this section that has an effective period of more than 1 year shall be phased down at regular intervals during the period in which the action is in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the designation of the article as an eligible article for the purposes of subchapter V of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) If an article was the subject of an action under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E) of subsection (a)(3) of this section, no new action may be taken under any of those subparagraphs with respect to such article for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a period beginning on the date on which the previous action terminates that is equal to the period in which the previous action was in effect, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a period of 2 years beginning on the date on which the previous action terminates,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the previous action under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E) of subsection (a)(3) of this section with respect to an article was in effect for a period of 180 days or less, the President may take a new action under any of those subparagraphs with respect to such article if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an action described in any of those subparagraphs has not been taken with respect to such article more than twice in the 5-year period immediately preceding the date on which the new action with respect to such article first becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certain agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the President takes action under this section other than the implemention of agreements of the type described in subsection (a)(3)(E) of this section, the President may, after such action takes effect, negotiate agreements of the type described in subsection (a)(3)(E) of this section, and may, after such agreements take effect, suspend or terminate, in whole or in part, any action previously taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an agreement implemented under subsection (a)(3)(E) of this section is not effective, the President may, consistent with the limitations contained in subsection (e) of this section, take additional action under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to carry out an international agreement concluded under this part, the President may prescribe regulations governing the entry or withdrawal from warehouse of articles covered by such agreement. In addition, in order to carry out any agreement of the type described in subsection (a)(3)(E) of this section that is concluded under this part with one or more countries accounting for a major part of United States imports of the article covered by such agreement, including imports into a major geographic area of the United States, the President may issue regulations governing the entry or withdrawal from warehouse of like articles which are the product of countries not parties to such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations prescribed under this subsection shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with efficient and fair administration, insure against inequitable sharing of imports by a relatively small number of the larger importers.</p>
