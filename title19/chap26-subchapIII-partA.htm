<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is not required to provide import relief under this section if the President determines that the provision of the import relief will not provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the initial period for any import relief provided under this section is less than 4 years, the President, after receiving a determination from the Commission under subparagraph (B) that is affirmative, or which the President considers to be affirmative under paragraph (1) of section 1330(d) of this title, may extend the effective period of any import relief provided under this section, subject to the limitation under paragraph (1), if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the import relief continues to be necessary to remedy or prevent serious injury and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry to import competition; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Upon a petition on behalf of the industry concerned that is filed with the Commission not earlier than the date which is 9 months, and not later than the date which is 6 months, before the date on which any action taken under subsection (a) is to terminate, the Commission shall conduct an investigation to determine whether action under this section continues to be necessary to remedy or prevent serious injury and whether there is evidence that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subparagraph in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold a public hearing at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, and to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The Commission shall transmit to the President a report on its investigation and determination under this subparagraph not later than 60 days before the action under subsection (a) is to terminate, unless the President specifies a different date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rate after termination of import relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When import relief under this section is terminated with respect to an article&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the rate of duty on that article after such termination and on or before December 31 of the year in which such termination occurs shall be the rate that, according to the Schedule of the United States to Annex 3.3 of the Agreement would have been in effect 1 year after the provision of relief under subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of duty for that article after December 31 of the year in which termination occurs shall be, at the discretion of the President, either&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rate of duty resulting from the elimination of the tariff in equal annual stages ending on the date set out in the Schedule of the United States to Annex 3.3 of the Agreement for the elimination of the tariff.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Articles exempt from relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No import relief may be provided under this section on&mdash;</p>
