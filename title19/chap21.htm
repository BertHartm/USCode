<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Government Procurement Procedures</em>. (a) Waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) With respect to eligible products (as defined in section 381(c) of the NAFTA Implementation Act [amending section 2518(4)(A) of this title]) of Canada and Mexico, and suppliers of such products, the application of any law, regulation, procedure, or practice regarding Federal Government procurement that would, if applied to such products or suppliers, result in treatment less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) to United States products and services and suppliers of such products and services; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) to eligible products of either Mexico or Canada, shall be waived.</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) This order shall apply only to solicitations issued on or after the date of entry into force of the NAFTA for the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Although regulatory implementation of this order must await revisions to the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), it is expected that agencies listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of this order will take all appropriate actions in the interim to implement those aspects of the order that are not dependent upon regulatory revision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Pursuant to section 25 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 421(a)), the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall ensure that the policies established herein are incorporated in the FAR within 30 days from the date this order is issued.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Government Use of Patented Technology</em>. (a) Each agency shall, within 30 days from the date this order is issued, modify or adopt procedures to ensure compliance with Article 1709(10) of the NAFTA regarding notice when patented technology is used by or for the Federal Government without a license from the owner, except that the requirement of Article 1709(10)(b) regarding reasonable efforts to obtain advance authorization from the patent owner:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) is hereby waived for an invention used or manufactured by or for the Federal Government, except that the patent owner must be notified whenever the agency or its contractor, without making a patent search, knows or has demonstrable reasonable grounds to know that an invention described in and covered by a valid United States patent is or will be used or manufactured without a license; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) is waived whenever a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency exists, ex<!-- PDFPage:633 -->cept that the patent owner must be notified as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies shall treat the term &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; as used in Articles 1709(10)(h) and (j) and 1715 of the NAFTA as equivalent to &ldquo;reasonable and entire compensation&rdquo; as used in section 1498 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In addition to the general provisions of section 7 of this order regarding enforceable rights, nothing in this order is intended to suggest that the giving of notice to a patent owner under Article 1709(10) of the NAFTA constitutes an admission that the Federal Government has infringed a valid privately-owned patent.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The industries (including agricultural industries) in the United States that have significantly increased exports to Mexico or Canada as a result of the Agreement, or in which imports into the United States from Mexico or Canada have increased significantly as a result of the Agreement, and the extent of any change in the wages, employment, or productivity in each such industry as a result of the Agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the reduction or abatement of pollution in the region of the United States-Mexico border.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In assessing the factors listed in subsection (a) of this section, to the extent possible, the study shall distinguish between the consequences of the Agreement and events that likely would have occurred without the Agreement. In addition, the study shall evaluate the effects of the Agreement relative to aggregate economic changes and, to the extent possible, relative to the effects of other factors, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) international competition,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reductions in defense spending,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:667 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Trade in motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts is one of the most restricted areas of trade between the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The elimination of Mexico's restrictive barriers to trade in motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts over a 10-year period under the Agreement should increase substantially United States exports of such products to Mexico.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Department of Commerce estimates that the Agreement provides the opportunity to increase United States exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts by $1,000,000,000 during the first year of the Agreement's implementation with the potential for additional increases over the 10-year transition period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States automotive industry has estimated that United States exports of motor vehicles to Mexico should increase to more than 60,000 units during the first year of the Agreement's implementation, which is substantially above the current level of 4,000 units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Trade Representative report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No later than July 1, 1995, and annually thereafter through 1999, the Trade Representative shall submit a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on how effective the provisions of the Agreement are with respect to increasing United States exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts to Mexico. Each report shall identify and determine the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The patterns of trade in motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts between the United States and Mexico during the preceding 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The level of tariff and nontariff barriers that were in force during the preceding 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The amount by which United States exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts to Mexico have increased from the preceding 12-month period as a result of the elimination of Mexican tariff and nontariff barriers under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether any such increase in United States exports meets the levels of new export opportunities anticipated under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If the anticipated levels of new United States export opportunities are not reached, what actions the Trade Representative is prepared to take to realize the benefits anticipated under the Agreement, including possible initiation of additional negotiations with Mexico for the purpose of seeking modifications of the Agreement.</p>
