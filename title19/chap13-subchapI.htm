<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the United States and the European Community (EC) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Government Procurement (Agreement) that provides appropriate reciprocal competitive government procurement opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the commitments made in the Agreement are intended to become part of an expanded General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Agreement on Government Procurement (GATT Code) and are an important step toward an expanded GATT Code;</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, as a result of these commitments, U.S. businesses will obtain increased access to EC member state procurement for U.S. goods and services;</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. In applying the provisions of the Buy American Act, the heads of the agencies listed in Annex 1, Parts A and B, of this order are requested, as of the date of this order, to apply no price differential between articles, materials, or supplies of U.S. origin and those originating in the member states of the EC.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. For purposes of this order, the rule of origin specified in section 308 of the Trade Agreements Act of <!-- PDFPage:567 -->1979, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2518), shall apply in determining whether goods originate in the member states of the EC.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. This order shall apply to solicitations outstanding on the date of this order, except for those for which the initial deadline for receipt of bids or proposals has passed, and to all solicitations issued after the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. Except for procurements by the Department of Defense, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) shall be responsible for interpretation of the Agreement. The USTR shall seek the advice of the interagency organization established under section 242(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1872(a)) and consult with affected agencies, including the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. This Executive order is effective immediately. Although regulatory implementation of this order must await revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), it is expected that agencies listed in Annex 1, Parts A and B, of this order will take all appropriate actions in the interim to implement those aspects of the order that are not dependent upon regulatory revision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Pursuant to section 25 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 421(a)), the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall ensure that the policies established herein are incorporated in the FAR within 30 days from the date this order is issued.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Overall negotiating objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall seek in the renegotiations provided for in article XXIV(7) of the Agreement more open and equitable market access abroad, and the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of devices which distort trade or commerce related to Government procurement, with the overall goal of maximizing the economic benefit to the United States through maintaining and enlarging foreign markets for products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, the development of fair and equitable market opportunities, and open and nondiscriminatory world trade. In carrying out the provisions of this subsection, the President shall consider the assessment made in the report required under section 2516(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2514_1_target" name="2514_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sector negotiating objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall seek, consistent with the overall objective set forth in subsection (a) of this section and to the maximum extent feasible, with respect to appropriate product sectors, competitive opportunities for the export of United States products to the developed countries of the world equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded by the United States, taking into account all barriers to, and other distortions of, international trade affecting that sector.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Independent verification objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall seek to establish in the renegotiation provided for in article XXIV(7) of the Agreement a system for independent verification of information provided by parties to the Agreement to the Committee on Government Procurement pursuant to article XIX(5) of the Agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reports on negotiations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report in the event of inadequate progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, during the renegotiations of the Agreement, the President at any time determines that the renegotiations are not progressing satisfactorily and are not likely to result, within twelve months of the commencement thereof, in an expansion of the Agreement to cover purchases by the entities of the governments of developed countries which are the principal purchasers of goods and equipment in appropriate product sectors, he shall so report to the congressional committees referred to in section 2512(c)(1) of this title. Taking into account the objectives set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and the factors required to be analyzed under section 2512(c) of this title, the President shall further report to such committees appropriate actions to seek reciprocity in such product sectors with such countries in the area of government procurement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Legislative recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Taking into account the factors required to be analyzed under section 2512(c) of this title, the President may recommend to the Congress legislation (with respect to entities of the Government which are not covered by the Agreement) which may prohibit such entities from purchasing products of such countries.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each annual report of the President under section 163(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2213(a)] made after July 26, 1979 shall report the actions, if any, the President deemed appropriate to establish reciprocity in appropriate product sectors with major industrial countries in the area of government procurement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Before exercising the waiver authority in section 2511 of this title for procurement not covered by the Agreement on the date it enters into force with respect to the United States, the President shall follow the consultation provisions of section 135 [19 U.S.C. 2155] and chapter 6 of title I of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2211 et seq.] for private sector and congressional consultations.</p>
