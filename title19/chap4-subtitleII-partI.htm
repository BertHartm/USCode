<p class="statutory-body">Except as hereinafter provided, every article of foreign origin (or its container, as provided in subsection (b) hereof) imported into the United States shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of the article. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Determine the character of words and phrases or abbreviations thereof which shall be acceptable as indicating the country of origin and prescribe any reasonable method of marking, whether by printing, stenciling, stamping, branding, labeling, or by any other reasonable method, and a conspicuous place on the article (or container) where the marking shall appear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Require the addition of any other words or symbols which may be appropriate to prevent deception or mistake as to the origin of the article or as to the origin of any other article with which such imported article is usually combined subsequent to importation but before delivery to an ultimate purchaser; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Authorize the exception of any article from the requirements of marking if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such article is incapable of being marked;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States without injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States, except at an expense economically prohibitive of its importation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The marking of a container of such article will reasonably indicate the origin of such article;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Such article is a crude substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Such article is imported for use by the importer and not intended for sale in its imported or any other form;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Such article is to be processed in the United States by the importer or for his account otherwise than for the purpose of concealing the origin of such article and in such manner that any mark contemplated by this section would necessarily be obliterated, destroyed, or permanently concealed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) An ultimate purchaser, by reason of the character of such article or by reason of the circumstances of its importation, must necessarily know the country of origin of such article even though it is not marked to indicate its origin;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Such article was produced more than twenty years prior to its importation into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) Such article is of a class or kind with respect to which the Secretary of the Treasury has given notice by publication in the weekly Treasury Decisions within two years after July 1, 1937, that articles of such class or kind were imported in substantial quantities during the five-year period imme<!-- PDFPage:59 -->diately preceding January 1, 1937, and were not required during such period to be marked to indicate their origin: <em>Provided</em>, That this subdivision shall not apply after September 1, 1938, to sawed lumber and timbers, telephone, trolley, electric-light, and telegraph poles of wood, and bundles of shingles; but the President is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of this proviso if he finds such action required to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of sections 1351, 1352, 1353, 1354 of this title, as extended; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) Such article cannot be marked after importation except at any expense which is economically prohibitive, and the failure to mark the article before importation was not due to any purpose of the importer, producer, seller, or shipper to avoid compliance with this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an article is excepted under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section from the requirements of marking, the immediate container, if any, of such article, or such other container or containers of such article as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be marked in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of such article, subject to all provisions of this section, including the same exceptions as are applicable to articles under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section. If articles are excepted from marking requirements under clause (F), (G), or (H) of subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, their usual containers shall not be subject to the marking requirements of this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, because of the nature of an article, it is technically or commercially infeasible to mark it by one of the five methods specified in paragraph (1), the article may be marked by an equally permanent method of marking or, in the case of small diameter pipe, tube, and fittings, by tagging the containers or bundles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Marking of compressed gas cylinders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No exception may be made under subsection (a)(3) of this section with respect to compressed gas cylinders designed to be used for the transport and storage of compressed gases whether or not certified prior to exportation to have been made in accordance with the safety requirements of sections 178.36 through 178.68 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, each of which shall be marked with the English name of the country of origin by means of die stamping, molding, etching, raised lettering, or an equally permanent method of marking.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services</p>
<p class="note-body">In Import Alert 66&ndash;47, the Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;) excluded the drug Mifepristine&mdash;commonly known as RU&ndash;486&mdash;from the list of drugs that individuals can import into the United States for their &ldquo;personal use,&rdquo; although the drugs have not yet been approved for distribution by the FDA. (<em>See</em> FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual, Chapter 9&ndash;71.) Import Alert 66&ndash;47 effectively bans the importation into this Nation of a drug that is used in other nations as a nonsurgical means of abortion.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am informed that in excluding RU&ndash;486 from the personal use importation exemption, the FDA appears to have based its decision on factors other than an assessment of the possible health and safety risks of the drug. Accordingly, I hereby direct that you promptly instruct the FDA to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant exclusion of RU&ndash;486 from the list of drugs that qualify for the personal use importation exemption. Furthermore, if the FDA concludes that RU&ndash;486 meets the criteria for the personal use importation exemption, I direct that you immediately take steps to rescind Import Alert 66&ndash;47.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, I direct that you promptly assess initiatives by which the Department of Health and Human Services can promote the testing, licensing, and manufacturing in the United States of RU&ndash;486 or other antiprogestins.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;476, title I, &sect;1442, Nov. 9, 2000, 114 Stat. 2163, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in a wide variety of products, including fur coats and jackets, fur trimmed garments, hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed animals, and other toys.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The United States represents one of the largest markets for the sale of fur and fur products in the world. Market demand for fur products in the United States has led to the introduction of dog and cat fur products into United States commerce, frequently based on deceptive or fraudulent labeling of the products to disguise the true nature of the fur and mislead United States wholesalers, retailers, and consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other furs such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink, and synthetic materials made to resemble real fur. Dog and cat fur is generally less expensive than other types of fur and may be used as a substitute for more expensive types of furs, which provides an incentive to engage in unfair or fraudulent trade practices in the importation, exportation, distribution, or sale of fur products, including deceptive labeling and other practices designed to disguise the true contents or origin of the product.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Forensic texts have documented that dog and cat fur products are being imported into the United States subject to deceptive labels or other practices designed to conceal the use of dog or cat fur in the production of wearing apparel, toys, and other products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Publicly available evidence reflects ongoing significant use of dogs and cats bred expressly for their fur by foreign fur producers for manufacture into wearing apparel, toys, and other products that have been introduced into United States commerce. The evidence indicates that foreign fur producers also rely on the use of stray dogs and cats and stolen pets for the manufacture of fur products destined for the world and United States markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated and inhumane.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The trade of dog and cat fur products is ethically and aesthetically abhorrent to United States citizens. Consumers in the United States have a right to know if products offered for sale contain dog or cat fur and to ensure that they are not unwitting participants in this gruesome trade.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Persons who engage in the sale of dog or cat fur products, including the fraudulent trade practices identified above, gain an unfair competitive advantage over persons who engage in legitimate trade in apparel, toys, and other products, and derive an unfair benefit from consumers who buy their products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The imposition of a ban on the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, transportation, and distribution of dog and cat fur products, regardless of their source, is consistent with the international obligations of the United States because it applies equally to domestic and foreign producers and avoids any discrimination among foreign sources of competing products. Such a ban is also consistent with provisions of international agreements to which the United States is a party that expressly allow for measures designed to protect the health and welfare of animals and to enjoin the use of deceptive trade practices in international or domestic commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter [chapter 3 (&sect;&sect;1441&ndash;1443) of subtitle B of title I of Pub. L. 106&ndash;476, see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note set out under section 1654 of this title] are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) prohibit imports, exports, sale, manufacture, offer for sale, transportation, and distribution in the United States of dog and cat fur products, in order to ensure that United States market demand does not provide an incentive to slaughter dogs or cats for their fur;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) require accurate labeling of fur species so that consumers in the United States can make informed choices and ensure that they are not unwitting contributors to this gruesome trade; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) ensure that the customs laws of the United States are not undermined by illicit international traffic in dog and cat fur products.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Articles removed in, or returned to, the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any article exempted from duty or tax, or in respect of which drawback has been allowed, under this section or section 1317 of this title and thereafter removed in the United States from any vessel or aircraft, or otherwise returned to the United States, shall be treated as an importation from a foreign country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reciprocal privileges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The privileges granted by this section and section 1317 of this title in respect of aircraft registered in a foreign country shall be allowed only if the Secretary of the Treasury shall have been advised by the Secretary of Commerce that he has found that such foreign country allows, or will allow, substantially reciprocal privileges in respect of aircraft registered in the United States. If the Secretary of Commerce shall advise the Secretary of the Treasury that he has found that a foreign country has discontinued, or will discontinue, the allowance of such privileges, the privileges granted by this section and such section 1317 shall not apply thereafter in respect of aircraft registered in that foreign country.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the convocation of a conference on the use or conservation of international fishery resources, the President shall, by all appropriate means at his disposal, seek to persuade countries whose domestic fishing practices or policies affect such resources, to engage in negotiations in good faith relating to the use or conservation of such resources. If, after such efforts by the President and by other countries which have agreed to engage in such negotiations, any other country whose conservation practices or policies affect the interests of the United States and such other countries, has, in the judgment of the President, failed or refused to engage in such negotiations in good faith, the President may, if he is satisfied that such action is likely to be effective in inducing such country to engage in such negotiations in good faith, increase the rate of duty on any fish (in any form) which is the product of such country, for such time as he deems necessary, to a rate not more than 50 percent above the rate existing on July 1, 1934.</p>
