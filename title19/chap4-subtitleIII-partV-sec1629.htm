<h4 class="note-head">Authority for the Establishment of Integrated Border Inspection Areas at the United States-Canada Border</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;429, title I, &sect;1560, Dec. 3, 2004, 118 Stat. 2580, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The increased security and safety concerns that developed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) One concern that has come to light is the vulnerability of the international bridges and tunnels along the United States borders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) It is necessary to ensure that potentially dangerous vehicles are inspected prior to crossing these bridges and tunnels; however, currently these vehicles are not inspected until after they have crossed into the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Establishing Integrated Border Inspection Areas (IBIAs) would address these concerns by inspecting vehicles before they gained access to the infrastructure of international bridges and tunnels joining the United States and Canada.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Creation of Integrated Border Inspection Areas.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commissioner of the Customs Service [Bureau of Customs and Border Protection], in consultation with the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), shall seek to establish Integrated Border Inspection Areas (IBIAs), such as areas on either side of the United States-Canada border, in which United States Customs officers can inspect vehicles entering the United States from Canada before they enter the United States, or Canadian Customs officers can inspect vehicles entering Canada from the United States before they enter Canada. Such inspections may include, where appropriate, employment of reverse inspection techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Additional requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commissioner of Customs, in consultation with the Administrator of the General Services Administration when appropriate, shall seek to carry out paragraph (1) in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on the surrounding community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Elements of the program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Using the authority granted by this section and under section 629 of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1629], the Commissioner of Customs, in consultation with the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency, shall seek to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) locate Integrated Border Inspection Areas in areas with bridges or tunnels with high traffic volume, significant commercial activity, and that have experienced backups and delays since September 11, 2001;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) ensure that United States Customs officers stationed in any such IBIA on the Canadian side of the border are vested with the maximum authority to carry out their duties and enforce United States law;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) ensure that United States Customs officers stationed in any such IBIA on the Canadian side of <!-- PDFPage:274 -->the border shall possess the same immunity that they would possess if they were stationed in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) encourage appropriate officials of the United States to enter into an agreement with Canada permitting Canadian Customs officers stationed in any such IBIA on the United States side of the border to enjoy such immunities as permitted in Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Creation of Integrated Border Inspection Areas</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;7, div.
