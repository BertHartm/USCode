<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) imports of the article from a NAFTA country, considered individually or, in exceptional circumstances, imports from NAFTA countries considered collectively, contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Substantial import share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether imports from a NAFTA country, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports, such imports normally shall not be considered to account for a substantial share of total imports if that country is not among the top 5 suppliers of the article subject to the investigation, measured in terms of import share during the most recent 3-year period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Application of &ldquo;contribute importantly&rdquo; standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether imports from a NAFTA country or countries contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, the International Trade Commission shall consider such factors as the change in the import share of the NAFTA country or countries, and the level and change in the level of imports of such country or countries. In applying the preceding sentence, imports from a NAFTA country or countries normally shall not be considered to contribute importantly to serious injury, or the threat thereof, if the growth rate of imports from such country or countries during the period in which an injurious increase in imports occurred is ap<!-- PDFPage:784 -->preciably lower than the growth rate of total imports from all sources over the same period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Contribute importantly&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and section 3372(a) of this title, the term &ldquo;contribute importantly&rdquo; refers to an important cause, but not necessarily the most important cause.</p>
