<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rate after termination of import relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When import relief under this section is terminated with respect to an article&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the rate of duty on that article after such termination and on or before December 31 of the year in which such termination occurs shall be the rate that, according to the Schedule of the United States to Annex 3.3 of the Agreement would have been in effect 1 year after the provision of relief under subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of duty for that article after December 31 of the year in which termination occurs shall be, at the discretion of the President, either&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Serious damage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (1), the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall examine the effect of increased imports on the domestic industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic factors as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits, and investment, none of which is necessarily decisive; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nature of relief</h4>
