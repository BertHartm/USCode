<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The industries (including agricultural industries) in the United States that have significantly increased exports to Mexico or Canada as a result of the Agreement, or in which imports into the United States from Mexico or Canada have increased significantly as a result of the Agreement, and the extent of any change in the wages, employment, or productivity in each such industry as a result of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The extent to which investment in new or existing production or other operations in the United States has been redirected to Mexico as a result of the Agreement, and the effect on United States employment of such redirection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reductions in defense spending,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recommendations of President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The study shall include any appropriate recommendations by the President with respect to the operation and effects of the Agreement, including recommendations with respect to the specific factors listed in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

Each such committee may hold hearings and make recommendations to the President with respect to the operation and effects of the Agreement.</p>
