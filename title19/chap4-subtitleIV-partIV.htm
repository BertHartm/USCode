<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; means the United States International Trade Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;country&rdquo; means a foreign country, a political subdivision, dependent territory, or possession of a foreign country, and, except for the purpose of antidumping proceedings, may include an association of 2 or more foreign countries, political subdivisions, dependent territories, or possessions of countries into a customs union outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Industry</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;industry&rdquo; means the producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Related parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If a producer of a domestic like product and an exporter or importer of the subject <!-- PDFPage:317 -->merchandise are related parties, or if a producer of the domestic like product is also an importer of the subject merchandise, the producer may, in appropriate circumstances, be excluded from the industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), a producer and an exporter or importer shall be considered to be related parties, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the producer directly or indirectly controls the exporter or importer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the exporter or importer directly or indirectly controls the producer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a third party directly or indirectly controls the producer and the exporter or importer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) the producer and the exporter or importer directly or indirectly control a third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the producer to act differently than a nonrelated producer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, a party shall be considered to directly or indirectly control another party if the party is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Regional industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In appropriate circumstances, the United States, for a particular product market, may be divided into 2 or more markets and the producers within each market may be treated as if they were a separate industry if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the producers within such market sell all or almost all of their production of the domestic like product in question in that market, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the demand in that market is not supplied, to any substantial degree, by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In such appropriate circumstances, material injury, the threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry may be found to exist with respect to an industry even if the domestic industry as a whole, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of that product, is not injured, if there is a concentration of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy into such an isolated market and if the producers of all, or almost all, of the production within that market are being materially injured or threatened by material injury, or if the establishment of an industry is being materially retarded, by reason of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy. The term &ldquo;regional industry&rdquo; means the domestic producers within a region who are treated as a separate industry under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Product lines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The effect of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed in relation to the United States production of a domestic like product if available data permit the separate identification of production in terms of such criteria as the production process or the producer's profits. If the domestic production of the domestic like product has no separate identity in terms of such criteria, then the effect of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes a domestic like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Industry producing processed agricultural products</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (v), in an investigation involving a processed agricultural product produced from any raw agricultural product, the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product may be considered part of the industry producing the processed product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the processed agricultural product is produced from the raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) there is a substantial coincidence of economic interest between the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product and the processors of the processed agricultural product based upon relevant economic factors, which may, in the discretion of the Commission, include price, added market value, or other economic interrelationships (regardless of whether such coincidence of economic interest is based upon any legal relationship).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the processed agricultural product shall be considered to be processed from a raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the raw agricultural product is substantially or completely devoted to the production of the processed agricultural product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the processed agricultural product is produced substantially or completely from the raw product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Relevant economic factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i)(II), in addition to such other factors it considers relevant to the question of coincidence of economic interest, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if price is taken into account, consider the degree of correlation between the price of the raw agricultural product and the price of the processed agricultural product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if added market value is taken into account, consider whether the value of the raw agricultural product constitutes a significant percentage of the value of the processed agricultural product.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:318 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Raw agricultural product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;raw agricultural product&rdquo; means any farm or fishery product.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Termination of this subparagraph</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall cease to have effect if the United States Trade Representative notifies the administering authority and the Commission that the application of this subparagraph is inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Countervailable subsidy</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (5B), a countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in this paragraph which is specific as described in paragraph (5A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subsidy described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A subsidy is described in this paragraph in the case in which an authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provides a financial contribution,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides any form of income or price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) makes a payment to a funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution, or entrusts or directs a private entity to make a financial contribution, if providing the contribution would normally be vested in the government and the practice does not differ in substance from practices normally followed by governments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">to a person and a benefit is thereby conferred. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (5A) and (5B), the term &ldquo;authority&rdquo; means a government of a country or any public entity within the territory of the country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination of whether a subsidy exists shall be made without regard to whether the recipient of the subsidy is publicly or privately owned and without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly or indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of merchandise. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining whether a subsidy exists under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Financial contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;financial contribution&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the direct transfer of funds, such as grants, loans, and equity infusions, or the potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities, such as loan guarantees,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) foregoing or not collecting revenue that is otherwise due, such as granting tax credits or deductions from taxable income,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) providing goods or services, other than general infrastructure, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) purchasing goods.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Benefit conferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A benefit shall normally be treated as conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of an equity infusion, if the investment decision is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors, including the practice regarding the provision of risk capital, in the country in which the equity infusion is made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a loan, if there is a difference between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on the market,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of a loan guarantee, if there is a difference, after adjusting for any difference in guarantee fees, between the amount the recipient of the guarantee pays on the guaranteed loan and the amount the recipient would pay for a comparable commercial loan if there were no guarantee by the authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in the case where goods or services are provided, if such goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration, and in the case where goods are purchased, if such goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Change in ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable, even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm's length transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5A) Specificity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A subsidy is specific if it is an export subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or an import substitution subsidy described in subparagraph (C), or if it is determined to be specific pursuant to subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Export subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An export subsidy is a subsidy that is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Import substitution subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An import substitution subsidy is a subsidy that is contingent upon the use of domestic goods over imported goods, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Domestic subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether a subsidy (other than a subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or (C)) is a specific subsidy, in law or in fact, <!-- PDFPage:319 -->to an enterprise or industry within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the following guidelines shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, expressly limits access to the subsidy to an enterprise or industry, the subsidy is specific as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, the subsidy is not specific as a matter of law, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) eligibility is automatic,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the criteria or conditions for eligibility are strictly followed, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The actual recipients of the subsidy, whether considered on an enterprise or industry basis, are limited in number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) An enterprise or industry is a predominant user of the subsidy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) An enterprise or industry receives a disproportionately large amount of the subsidy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) The manner in which the authority providing the subsidy has exercised discretion in the decision to grant the subsidy indicates that an enterprise or industry is favored over others.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In evaluating the factors set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), and (IV), the administering authority shall take into account the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, and the length of time during which the subsidy program has been in operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Where a subsidy is limited to an enterprise or industry located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the subsidy is specific.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (5B), any reference to an enterprise or industry is a reference to a foreign enterprise or foreign industry and includes a group of such enterprises or industries.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5B) Categories of noncountervailable subsidies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (5A), in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, a subsidy shall be treated as noncountervailable if the administering authority determines in an investigation under part I of this subtitle or a review under part III of this subtitle that the subsidy meets all of the criteria described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), as the case may be, or the provisions of subparagraph (E)(i) apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Research subsidy</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except for a subsidy provided on the manufacture, production, or export of civil aircraft, a subsidy for research activities conducted by a person, or by a higher education or research establishment on a contract basis with a person, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy covers not more than 75 percent of the costs of industrial research or not more than 50 percent of the costs of precompetitive development activity, and such subsidy is limited exclusively to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the costs of researchers, technicians, and other supporting staff employed exclusively in the research activity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs of instruments, equipment, land, or buildings that are used exclusively and permanently (except when disposed of on a commercial basis) for the research activity,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) Industrial research</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;industrial research&rdquo; means planned search or critical investigation aimed at the discovery of new knowledge, with the objective that such knowledge may be useful in developing new products, processes, or services, or in bringing about a significant improvement to existing products, processes, or services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;precompetitive development activity&rdquo; means the translation of industrial research findings into a plan, blueprint, or design for new, modified, or improved products, processes, or services, whether intended for sale or use, including the creation of a first prototype that would not be capable of commercial use. The term also may include the conceptual formulation and design of products, processes, or services alternatives and initial demonstration or pilot <!-- PDFPage:320 -->projects, if these same projects cannot be converted or used for industrial application or commercial exploitation. The term does not include routine or periodic alterations to existing products, production lines, manufacturing processes, services, or other ongoing operations even if those alterations may represent improvements.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Calculation rules</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of a research activity that spans both industrial research and precompetitive development activity, the allowable level of the noncountervailable subsidy shall not exceed 62.5 percent of the costs set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), and (V) of clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Total eligible costs</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy provided, pursuant to a general framework of regional development, to a person located in a disadvantaged region within a country shall be treated as noncountervailable, if it is not specific (within the meaning of paragraph (5A)) within eligible regions and if the following conditions are met:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Each region is considered a disadvantaged region on the basis of neutral and objective criteria indicating that the region is disadvantaged because of more than temporary circumstances, and such criteria are clearly stated in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) The criteria described in subclause (II) include a measurement of economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) Programs provided within a general framework of regional development include ceilings on the amount of assistance that can be granted to a subsidized project. Such ceilings are differentiated according to the different levels of development of assisted regions, and are expressed in terms of investment costs or costs of job creation. Within such ceilings, the distribution of assistance is sufficiently broad and even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or the provision of disproportionately large amounts of a subsidy to, an enterprise or industry as described in paragraph (5A)(D).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Measurement of economic development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the measurement of economic development shall be based on one or more of the following factors:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The measurement of economic development shall cover a 3-year period, but may be a composite measurement and may include factors other than those set forth in this clause.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) General framework of regional development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;general framework of regional development&rdquo; means that the regional subsidy programs are part of an internally consistent and generally applicable regional development policy, and that regional development subsidies are not granted in isolated geographical points having no, or virtually no, influence on the development of a region.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Neutral and objective criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;neutral and objective criteria&rdquo; means criteria that do not favor certain regions beyond what is appropriate for the elimination or reduction of regional disparities within the framework of the regional development policy.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Subsidy for adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subsidy that is provided to promote the adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements that are imposed by statute or by regulation, and that result in greater constraints and financial burdens on the recipient of the subsidy, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is a one-time nonrecurring measure,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is limited to 20 percent of the cost of adaptation,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the notification required under section 1671d(d) or 1673d(d) of this title, as the case may be, the Commission shall explain its analysis of each factor considered under clause (i), and identify each factor considered under clause (ii) and explain in full its relevance to the determination.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Evaluation of relevant factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (B)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Volume</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In evaluating the volume of imports of merchandise, the Commission shall consider whether the volume of imports of the merchandise, or any increase in that volume, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, is significant.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In evaluating the effect of imports of such merchandise on prices, the Commission shall consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Impact on affected domestic industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In examining the impact required to be considered under subparagraph (B)(i)(III), the Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this clause within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Captive production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If domestic producers internally transfer significant production of the domestic like product for the production of a downstream article and sell significant production of the domestic like product in the merchant market, and the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the domestic like product produced that is internally transferred for processing into that downstream article does not enter the merchant market for the domestic like product,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the domestic like product is the predominant material input in the production of that downstream article, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the production of the domestic like product sold in the merchant market is not generally used in the production of that downstream article,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;then the Commission, in determining market share and the factors affecting financial performance set forth in clause (iii), shall focus primarily on the merchant market for the domestic like product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rules for agricultural products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The Commission shall not determine that there is no material injury or threat of material injury to United States producers of an agricultural commodity merely because the prevailing market price is at or above the minimum support price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In the case of agricultural products, the Commission shall consider any increased burden on government income or price support programs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Nature of countervailable subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining whether there is a threat of material injury, the Commission shall consider information provided to it by the administering authority regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy granted by a foreign country (particularly whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement) and the effects likely to be caused by the countervailable subsidy.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Standard for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate under subparagraph (C) or (D) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination by the Commission of material injury.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other relevant economic factors&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) inventories of the subject merchandise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) in any investigation under this subtitle which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(E)(iv)) and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 1671d(b)(1) or 1673d(b)(1) of this title with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VIII) the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic <!-- PDFPage:323 -->industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall consider the factors set forth in clause (i) as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this subtitle. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under clause (i) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Effect of dumping in third-country markets</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In investigations under part II of this subtitle, the Commission shall consider whether dumping in the markets of foreign countries (as evidenced by dumping findings or antidumping remedies in other WTO member markets against the same class or kind of merchandise manufactured or exported by the same party as under investigation) suggests a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. In the course of its investigation, the Commission shall request information from the foreign manufacturer, exporter, or United States importer concerning this issue.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;WTO member market&rdquo; means the market of any country which is a WTO member.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Records in final investigations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In each final determination in which it cumulatively assesses the volume and effect of imports under clause (i), the Commission shall make its determinations based on the record compiled in the first investigation in which it makes a final determination, except that when the administering authority issues its final determination in a subsequently completed investigation, the Commission shall permit the parties in the subsequent investigation to submit comments concerning the significance of the administering authority's final determination, and shall include such comments and the administering authority's final determination in the record for the subsequent investigation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Regional industry determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In an investigation which involves a regional industry, and in which the Commission decides that the volume and effect of imports should be cumulatively assessed under this subparagraph, such assessment shall be based upon the volume and effect <!-- PDFPage:324 -->of imports into the region or regions determined by the Commission. The provisions of clause (iii) shall apply to such investigations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall consider whether any change in the volume, price effects, or impact of imports of the subject merchandise since the filing of the petition in an investigation under part I or II of this subtitle is related to the pendency of the investigation and, if so, the Commission may reduce the weight accorded to the data for the period after the filing of the petition in making its determination of material injury, threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule for merchandise with value added after importation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the subject merchandise is imported by a person affiliated with the exporter or producer, and the value added in the United States by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise, the administering authority shall determine the constructed export price for such merchandise by using one of the following prices if there is a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison and the administering authority determines that the use of such sales is appropriate:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The price of identical subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining under this subtitle whether subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value, a fair comparison shall be made between the export price or constructed export price and normal value. In order to achieve a fair comparison with the export price or constructed export price, normal value shall be determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of normal value</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The normal value of the subject merchandise shall be the price described in subparagraph (B), at a time reasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to determine the export price or constructed export price under section 1677a(a) or (b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The price referred to in subparagraph (A) is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the price at which the foreign like product is first sold (or, in the absence of a sale, offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in a case to which subparagraph (C) applies, the price at which the foreign like product is so sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in a country other than the exporting country or the United States, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such price is representative,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold by the exporter or producer in such other country is 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or value) of the subject merchandise sold in the United States or for export to the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the administering authority does not determine that the particular market situation in such other country prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Third country sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This subparagraph applies when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the foreign like product is not sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country as described in subparagraph (B)(i),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the administering authority determines that the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country is insufficient to permit a proper comparison with the sales of the subject merchandise to the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the particular market situation in the exporting country does not permit a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clause (ii), the aggregate quantity (or value) of the foreign like prod<!-- PDFPage:335 -->uct sold in the exporting country shall normally be considered to be insufficient if such quantity (or value) is less than 5 percent of the aggregate quantity (or value) of sales of the subject merchandise to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fictitious markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No pretended sale or offer for sale, and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish a fictitious market, shall be taken into account in determining normal value. The occurrence of different movements in the prices at which different forms of the foreign like product are sold (or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale) in the exporting country after the issuance of an antidumping duty order may be considered by the administering authority as evidence of the establishment of a fictitious market for the foreign like product if the movement in such prices appears to reduce the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exportation from an intermediate country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the subject merchandise is exported to the United States from an intermediate country, normal value shall be determined in the intermediate country, except that normal value may be determined in the country of origin of the subject merchandise if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the producer knew at the time of the sale that the subject merchandise was destined for exportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the subject merchandise is merely transshipped through the intermediate country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sales of the foreign like product in the intermediate country do not satisfy the conditions of paragraph (1)(C); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the foreign like product is not produced in the intermediate country.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of constructed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority determines that the normal value of the subject merchandise cannot be determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i), then, notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the normal value of the subject merchandise may be the constructed value of that merchandise, as determined under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Indirect sales or offers for sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the foreign like product is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale through an affiliated party, the prices at which the foreign like product is sold (or offered for sale) by such affiliated party may be used in determining normal value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increased by the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) when included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount, if any, included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), attributable to any additional costs, charges, and expenses incident to bringing the foreign like product from the original place of shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amount of any taxes imposed directly upon the foreign like product or components thereof which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, on the subject merchandise, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of the foreign like product, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increased or decreased by the amount of any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise provided under this section) that is established to the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or partly due to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the fact that the quantities in which the subject merchandise is sold or agreed to be sold to the United States are greater than or less than the quantities in which the foreign like product is sold, agreed to be sold, or offered for sale,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fact that merchandise described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 1677(16) of this title is used in determining normal value, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) other differences in the circumstances of sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Additional adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Level of trade</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall also be increased or decreased to make due allowance for any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise made under this section) that is shown to be wholly or partly due to a difference in level of trade between the export price or constructed export price and normal value, if the difference in level of trade&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) involves the performance of different selling activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In a case described in the preceding sentence, the amount of the adjustment shall be based on the price differences between the two levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Constructed export price offset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">When normal value is established at a level of trade which constitutes a more ad<!-- PDFPage:336 -->vanced stage of distribution than the level of trade of the constructed export price, but the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine under subparagraph (A)(ii) a level of trade adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under section 1677a(d)(1)(D) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Adjustments to constructed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Constructed value as determined under subsection (e) of this section, may be adjusted, as appropriate, pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sales at less than cost of production</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination; sales disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of that product, the administering authority shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of production. If the administering authority determines that sales made at less than the cost of production&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have been made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) were not at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such sales may be disregarded in the determination of normal value. Whenever such sales are disregarded, normal value shall be based on the remaining sales of the foreign like product in the ordinary course of trade. If no sales made in the ordinary course of trade remain, the normal value shall be based on the constructed value of the merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reasonable grounds to believe or suspect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There are reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product were made at prices that are less than the cost of production of the product, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in an investigation initiated under section 1673a of this title or a review conducted under section 1675 of this title, an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title provides information, based upon observed prices or constructed prices or costs, that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of the product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in a review conducted under section 1675 of this title involving a specific exporter, the administering authority disregarded some or all of the exporter's sales pursuant to paragraph (1) in the investigation or if a review has been completed, in the most recently completed review.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extended period of time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;extended period of time&rdquo; means a period that is normally 1 year, but not less than 6 months.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Substantial quantities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Sales made at prices below the cost of production have been made in substantial quantities if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the volume of such sales represents 20 percent or more of the volume of sales under consideration for the determination of normal value, or</p>

For purposes of this subsection, in determining the normal value of the foreign like product produced in a country outside of the exporting country, the administering authority shall determine its price at the time of exportation from the exporting country and shall make any adjustments required by subsection (a) of this section for the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States by reference to such costs in the exporting country.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (1), the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such materials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special rules for calculation of cost of production and for calculation of constructed value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsections (b) and (e) of this section.&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country (or the producing country, where appropriate) and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise. The administering authority shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a timely basis, if such allocations have been historically used by the exporter or producer, in particular for establishing appropriate amortization and depreciation periods, and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonrecurring costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those nonrecurring costs that benefit current or future production, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Startup costs</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for circumstances in which costs incurred during the time period covered by the investigation or review are affected by startup operations.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Startup operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Adjustments shall be made for startup operations only where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a producer is using new production facilities or producing a new product that requires substantial additional investment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) production levels are limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of subclause (II), the initial phase of commercial production ends at the end of the startup period. In determining whether commercial production levels have been achieved, the administering authority shall consider factors unrelated to startup operations that might affect the volume of production processed, such as demand, seasonality, or business cycles.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustment for startup operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The adjustment for startup operations shall be made by substituting the unit production costs incurred with respect to the merchandise at the end of the startup period for the unit production costs incurred during the startup period. If the startup period extends beyond the period of the investigation or review under this subtitle, the administering authority shall use the most recent cost of production data that it reasonably can obtain, analyze, and verify without delaying the timely completion of the investigation or review. For purposes of this subparagraph, the startup period ends at the point at which the level of commercial production that is characteristic of the merchandise, producer, or industry concerned is achieved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transactions disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A transaction directly or indirectly between affiliated persons may be disregarded if, in the case of any element of value required to be considered, the amount representing that element does not fairly reflect the amount usually reflected in sales of merchandise under consideration in the market under consideration. If a transaction is disregarded under the preceding sentence and no other transactions are available for consideration, the determination of the amount shall be based on the information available as to what the amount would have been if the transaction had occurred between persons who are not affiliated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Major input rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the case of a transaction between affiliated persons involving the production by one of such persons of a major input to the merchandise, the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an amount represented as the value of such input is less than the cost of production of such input, then the administering authority may determine the value of the major input on the basis of the information available regarding such cost of production, if such cost is greater than the amount that would be determined for such input under paragraph (2).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Issuance of protective orders</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If binational panel review of a determination under this subtitle is requested pursuant to article 1904 of the NAFTA or the United States-Canada Agreement, or an extraordinary challenge committee is convened under Annex 1904.13 of the NAFTA or the United States-Canada Agreement, the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, may make available to authorized persons, under a protective order described in paragraph (2), a copy of all proprietary material in the administrative record made during the proceeding in question. If the administering authority or the Commission claims a privilege as to a document or portion of a document in the administrative record of the proceeding in question and a binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee finds that in camera inspection or limited disclosure of that document or portion thereof is required by United States law, the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, may restrict access to such document or portion thereof to the authorized persons identified by the panel or committee as requiring access and may require such persons to obtain access under a protective order described in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Authorized persons</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A decision concerning the disclosure or nondisclosure of material under protective order by the administering authority or the Commission shall not be subject to judicial review, and no court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review such decision on any question of law or fact by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents of protective order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each protective order issued under this subsection shall be in such form and contain such requirements as the administering authority or the Commission may determine by regulation to be appropriate. The administering authority and the Commission shall ensure that regulations issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be designed to provide an opportunity for participation in the binational panel proceeding, including any extraordinary challenge, equivalent to that available for judicial review of determinations by the administering authority or the Commission that are not subject to review by a binational panel.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prohibited acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is unlawful for any person to violate, to induce the violation of, or knowingly to receive information the receipt of which constitutes a violation of, any provision of a protective order issued under this subsection or to violate, to induce the violation of, or knowingly to receive information the receipt of which constitutes a violation of, any provision of an undertaking entered into with an authorized agency of a free trade area country (as defined in section 1516a(f)(10) of this title) to protect proprietary material during binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee review pursuant to article 1904 of the NAFTA or the United States-Canada Agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sanctions for violation of protective orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person, except a judge appointed to a binational panel or an extraordinary challenge committee under section 3432(b) of this title, who is found by the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5 to have committed an act prohibited by paragraph (3) shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty and shall be subject to such other administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, debarment from practice before the administering authority or the Commission, as the administering authority or the Commission determines to be appropriate. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. The amount of such civil penalty and other sanctions shall be assessed by the administering authority or the Commission by written notice, except that assessment shall be made by the administering authority for violation, inducement of a violation or receipt of information with reason to know that such information was disclosed in violation, of an undertaking entered into by any person with an authorized agency of a free trade area country (as defined in section 1516a(f)(10) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review of sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person against whom sanctions are imposed under paragraph (4) may obtain review of such sanctions by filing a notice of appeal in the United States Court of International Trade within 30 days from the date of the order imposing the sanction and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate. The administering authority or the Commission shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such sanction imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the export price (or constructed export price) under section 1677a of this title or the normal value under section 1677b of this title, and in carrying out reviews under section 1675 of this title, the administering authority may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use averaging and statistically valid samples, if there is a significant volume of sales of the subject merchandise or a significant number or types of products, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decline to take into account adjustments which are insignificant in relation to the price or value of the merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Selection of averages and samples</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority to select averages and statistically valid samples shall rest exclusively with the administering authority. The administering authority shall, to the greatest extent possible, consult with the exporters and producers regarding the method to be used to select exporters, producers, or types of products under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of dumping margin</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining weighted average dumping margins under section 1673b(d), 1673d(c), or 1675(a) of this title, the administering authority shall determine the individual weighted average dumping margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If it is not practicable to make individual weighted average dumping margin determinations under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may determine the weighted average dumping margins for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a sample of exporters, producers, or types of products that is statistically valid based on the information available to the administering authority at the time of selection, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that can be reasonably examined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of less than fair value</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Investigations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In an investigation under part II of this subtitle, the administering authority shall determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the weighted average of the export prices (and constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by comparing the normal values of individual transactions to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administering authority may determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a pattern of export prices (or constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the administering authority explains why such differences cannot be taken into account using a method described in paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reviews</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a review under section 1675 of this title, when comparing export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions to the weighted average price of sales of the foreign like product, the administering authority shall limit its averaging of prices to a period not exceeding the calendar month that corresponds most closely to the calendar month of the individual export sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Determination of countervailable subsidy rate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining countervailable subsidy rates under section 1671b(d), 1671d(c), or 1675(a) of this title, the administering authority shall determine an individual countervailable subsidy rate for each known exporter or producer of the subject merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the administering authority determines that it is not practicable to determine individual countervailable subsidy rates under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determine individual countervailable subsidy rates for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:349 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a sample of exporters or producers that the administering authority determines is statistically valid based on the information available to the administering authority at the time of selection, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that the administering authority determines can be reasonably examined; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determine a single country-wide subsidy rate to be applied to all exporters and producers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The individual countervailable subsidy rates determined under subparagraph (A) shall be used to determine the all-others rate under section 1671d(c)(5) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1677i. Downstream product monitoring</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition requesting monitoring</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A domestic producer of an article that is like a component part or a downstream product may petition the administering authority to designate a downstream product for monitoring under subsection (b) of this section. The petition shall specify&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the downstream product,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the component product incorporated into such downstream product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the reasons for suspecting that the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties has resulted in a diversion of exports of the component part into increased production and exportation to the United States of such downstream product.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination regarding petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 14 days after receiving a petition submitted under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether there is a reasonable likelihood that imports into the United States of the downstream product will increase as an indirect result of any diversion with respect to the component part, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the component part is already subject to monitoring to aid in the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement (within the meaning of section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) merchandise related to the component part and manufactured in the same foreign country in which the component part is manufactured has been the subject of a significant number of investigations suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title or countervailing or antidumping duty orders issued under this subtitle or section 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1677i_1_target" name="1677i_1">1</a></sup> of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) merchandise manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or exporter of the component part that is similar in description and use to the component part has been the subject of at least 2 investigations suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title or countervailing or antidumping duty orders issued under this subtitle or section 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1677i_1_target" name="1677i_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors to take into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (2)(A), the administering authority may, if appropriate, take into account such factors as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the value of the component part in relation to the value of the downstream product,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which the component part has been substantially transformed as a result of its incorporation into the downstream product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the relationship between the producers of component parts and producers of downstream products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Publication of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register notice of each determination made under paragraph (2) and, if the determination made under paragraph (2)(A) and a determination made under any subparagraph of paragraph (2)(B) are affirmative, shall transmit a copy of such determinations and the petition to the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Determinations not subject to judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any determination made by the administering authority under paragraph (2) shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Monitoring by Commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination made under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section and a determination made under any clause of subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section with respect to a petition are affirmative, the Commission shall immediately commence monitoring of trade in the downstream product that is the subject of the determination made under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section. If the Commission finds that imports of a downstream product being monitored increased during any calendar quarter by 5 percent or more over the preceding quarter, the Commission shall analyze that increase in the context of overall economic conditions in the product sector.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make quarterly reports to the administering authority regarding the monitoring and analyses conducted under paragraph (1). The Commission shall make the reports available to the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action on basis of monitoring reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall review the information in the reports submitted by the Commission under subsection (b)(2) of this section and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider the information in determining whether to initiate an investigation under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title regarding any downstream product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) request the Commission to cease monitoring any downstream product if the information indicates that imports into the United States are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversion with respect to component parts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;component part&rdquo; means any imported article that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:351 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during the 5-year period ending on the date on which the petition is filed under subsection (a) of this section, has been subject to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a countervailing or antidumping duty order issued under this subtitle or section 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1677i_2_target" name="1677i_2">2</a></sup> of this title that requires the deposit of estimated countervailing or antidumping duties imposed at a rate of at least 15 percent ad valorem, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an agreement entered into under section 1671c, 1673c, or 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1677i_2_target" name="1677i_2">2</a></sup> of this title after a preliminary affirmative determination under section 1671b(b), 1673b(b)(1), or 1303&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1677i_2_target" name="1677i_2">2</a></sup> of this title was made by the administering authority which included a determination that the estimated net countervailable subsidy was at least 15 percent ad valorem or that the estimated average amount by which the normal value exceeded the export price (or the constructed export price) was at least 15 percent ad valorem, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) because of its inherent characteristics, is routinely used as a major part, component, assembly, subassembly, or material in a downstream product.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;downstream product&rdquo; means any manufactured article&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is imported into the United States, and</p>

If the Commission decides to provide such written advice, it shall promptly notify the administering authority of its intention to do so, and must provide such advice within 60 days after the date of notification under paragraph (1). For purposes of formulating its advice with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in the United States from parts or components produced in a foreign country, the Commission shall consider whether the inclusion of such parts or components taken as a whole would be inconsistent with its prior affirmative determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time limits for administering authority determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall, to the maximum extent practicable, make the determinations under this section within 300 days from the date of the initiation of a countervailing duty or antidumping circumvention inquiry under this section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the number of exporters or producers who have submitted such information is not so large that individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person providing factual information to the administering authority or the Commission in connection with a proceeding under this subtitle on behalf of the petitioner or any other interested party shall certify that such information is accurate and complete to the best of that person's knowledge.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deficient submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the administering authority or the Commission determines that a response to a request for information under this subtitle does not comply with the request, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) shall promptly inform the person submitting the response of the nature of the deficiency and shall, to the extent practicable, provide that person with an opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency in light of the time limits established for the completion of investigations or reviews under this subtitle. If that person submits further information in response to such deficiency and either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) finds that such response is not satisfactory, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such response is not submitted within the applicable time limits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) may, subject to subsection (e) of this section, disregard all or part of the original and subsequent responses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of certain information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In reaching a determination under section 1671b, 1671d, 1673b, 1673d, 1675, or 1675b of this title the administering authority and the Commission shall not decline to consider information that is submitted by an interested party and is necessary to the determination but does not meet all the applicable requirements established by the administering authority or the Commission, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the information is submitted by the deadline established for its submission,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the information can be verified,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the information is not so incomplete that it cannot serve as a reliable basis for reaching the applicable determination,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the interested party has demonstrated that it acted to the best of its ability in providing the information and meeting the requirements established by the administering authority or the Commission with respect to the information, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the information can be used without undue difficulties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nonacceptance of submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the administering authority or the Commission declines to accept into the record any information submitted in an investigation or review under this subtitle, it shall, to the extent practicable, provide to the person submitting the information a written explanation of the reasons for not accepting the information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Public comment on information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Information that is submitted on a timely basis to the administering authority or the Commission during the course of a proceeding under this subtitle shall be subject to comment by other parties to the proceeding within such reasonable time as the administering authority or the Commission shall provide. The administering authority and the Commission, before making a final determination under section 1671d, 1673d, 1675, or 1675b of this title shall cease collecting information and shall provide the parties with a final opportunity to comment on the information obtained by the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) upon which the parties have not previously had an opportunity to comment. Comments containing new factual information shall be disregarded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Termination of investigation or revocation of order for lack of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) terminate an investigation under part I or II of this subtitle with respect to a domestic like product if, prior to publication of an order under section 1671e or 1673e of this title, the administering authority determines that pro<!-- PDFPage:356 -->ducers accounting for substantially all of the production of that domestic like product have expressed a lack of interest in issuance of an order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) revoke an order issued under section 1671e or 1673e of this title with respect to a domestic like product, or terminate an investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title with respect to a domestic like product, if the administering authority determines that producers accounting for substantially all of the production of that domestic like product, have expressed a lack of interest in the order or suspended investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The administering authority shall verify all information relied upon in making&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a final determination in an investigation,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a final determination in a review under section 1675(a) of this title, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) verification is timely requested by an interested party as defined in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no verification was made under this subparagraph during the 2 immediately preceding reviews and determinations under section 1675(a) of this title of the same order, finding, or notice, except that this clause shall not apply if good cause for verification is shown.</p>
