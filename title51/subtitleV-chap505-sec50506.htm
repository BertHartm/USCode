<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), in the matter before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;The Secretary of Commerce shall periodically make awards&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The Secretary of Commerce shall periodically make, and the Chairman of the National Space Council shall present, awards&rdquo; to eliminate obsolete language. The reference to the Chairman of the National Space Council is obsolete because the National Space Council (established by section 501 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100&ndash;685, 102 Stat. 4102)) has not functioned or been staffed since 1993.</p>
