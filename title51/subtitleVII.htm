<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least annually, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report certifying that the payloads scheduled to be launched on the space shuttle for the next 4 years are consistent with the policy set forth in subsection (a)(1). For each payload scheduled to be launched from the space shuttle that does not <!-- PDFPage:109 -->require a human presence, the Administrator shall, in the certified report to Congress, state the specific circumstances that justified the use of the space shuttle. If, during the period between scheduled reports to Congress, any additions are made to the list of certified payloads intended to be launched from the shuttle, the Administrator shall inform Congress of the additions and the reasons therefor within 45 days of the change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Administration Payloads</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The report described in subsection (b) shall also include those Administration payloads designed solely to fly on the space shuttle which have begun the phase C/D of its development cycle.</p>

(a) The Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] is directed to undertake the construction of a permanently manned space station (hereinafter referred to as the &lsquo;space station&rsquo;) to become operational in 1995. The space station will be used for the following purposes&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 108. In order to ensure that the development of the space station is part of a balanced civilian space program, the Administrator is instructed to establish as a goal a funding profile that limits (1) space station total annual costs under the capital development plan in section 107 to 25 percent of the total budget request for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and (2) all space station direct operations costs, except for those costs associated with the utilization of the space station, to 10 percent of the total budget request for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 109.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) conserve and efficiently allocate the resources of the space station.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) The Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive or modify such user fees when in the Administrator's judgment such waiver or modification will further the goals and purposes of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 [see 51 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.], including&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;155, title III, &sect;321, Dec. 30, 2005, 119 Stat. 2922, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Short Title</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section may be cited as the &lsquo;George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and pose a similar threat in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects&rsquo; closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section the term &lsquo;near-Earth object&rsquo; means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Near-Earth Object Survey</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Survey program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 2005].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) [Amended former section 2451 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.]</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Fifth-year report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after the date of enactment of this Act, a report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Initial report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act an initial report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended option.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Analysis of possible alternatives that NASA could employ to divert an object on a likely collision course with Earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The time needed to eliminate or mitigate the threat of a collision of a potentially hazardous near-Earth object with Earth is measured in decades.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets can provide adequate collision information, enabling the United States to include both asteroid-collision and comet-collision disaster recovery and disaster avoidance in its public-safety structure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Basic information is needed for technical and policy decisionmaking for the United States to create a comprehensive program in order to be ready to eliminate and mitigate the serious and credible threats to humankind posed by potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) As a first step to eliminate and to mitigate the risk of such collisions, situation and decision analysis processes, as well as procedures and system resources, must be in place well before a collision threat becomes known.&rdquo;</p>
