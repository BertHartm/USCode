<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13419. National Aeronautics Research and Development</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13419, Dec. 20, 2006, 71 F.R. 77565, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 204 of the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6613), section 101(c) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109&ndash;155), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy</em>. Continued progress in aeronautics, the science of flight, is essential to America's economic success and the protection of America's security interests at home and around the globe. Accordingly, it shall be the policy of the United States to facilitate progress in aeronautics research and development (R&D) through appropriate funding and activities of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State, territorial, tribal, local, and foreign governments, international organizations, academic and research institutions, private organizations, and other entities, as appropriate. The Federal Government shall only undertake roles in supporting aeronautics R&D that are not more appropriately performed by the private sector. The National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy prepared by the National Science and Technology Council should, to the extent consistent with this order and its implementation, guide the aeronautics R&D programs of the United States through 2020.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Functions of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy</em>. To implement the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (the &ldquo;Director&rdquo;) shall:</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) recommend to the President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the heads of executive departments and agencies, as appropriate, such actions with respect to funding and activities of the Federal Government relating to aeronautics R&D as may be necessary to</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) advance United States technological leadership in aeronautics;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) support innovative research leading to significant advances in aeronautical concepts, technologies, and capabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) pursue and develop advanced aeronautics concepts and technologies, including those for advanced aircraft systems and air transportation management systems, to benefit America's security and effective and efficient national airspace management;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) maintain and advance United States aeronautics research, development, test and evaluation infrastructure to provide effective experimental and computational capabilities in support of aeronautics R&D;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) facilitate the educational development of the future aeronautics workforce as needed to further Federal Government interests;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) enhance coordination and communication among executive departments and agencies to maximize the effectiveness of Federal Government R&D resources; and</p>
