<h4 class="note-head">George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;155, title III, &sect;321, Dec. 30, 2005, 119 Stat. 2922, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Short Title</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section may be cited as the &lsquo;George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and pose a similar threat in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects&rsquo; closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section the term &lsquo;near-Earth object&rsquo; means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Near-Earth Object Survey</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Survey program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 2005].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) [Amended former section 2451 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.]</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Fifth-year report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after the date of enactment of this Act, a report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Initial report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act an initial report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended option.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Analysis of possible alternatives that NASA could employ to divert an object on a likely collision course with Earth.&rdquo;</p>
