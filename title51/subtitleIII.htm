<p class="note-body">My Administration is committed to implementing a bold, new approach to human spaceflight. Supported by a $6 billion increase to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) budget over the next 5 years, this strategy will foster the development of path-breaking technologies, increase the reach and reduce the cost of human and robotic exploration of space, and help create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p class="note-body">NASA's budget also includes $429 million next year, and $1.9 billion over the next 5 years, to modernize the Kennedy Space Center and other nearby space launch facilities in Florida. This modernization effort will help spur new commercial business and innovation and provide additional good jobs to the region. While all of the new aspects of my Administration's plan together will create thousands of new jobs in Florida, past decisions to end the Space Shuttle program will still affect families and communities along Florida's &ldquo;Space Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Building on this significant new investment at the Kennedy Space Center and my increased budget for NASA overall, I am committed to taking additional steps to help local economies like Florida's Space Coast adapt and thrive in the years ahead. The men and women who work in Florida's aerospace industry are some of the most talented and highly trained in the Nation. It is critical that their skills are tapped as we transform and expand the country's space exploration efforts. That is why I am launching a $40 million, multi-agency initiative to help the Space Coast transform their economies and prepare their workers for the opportunities of tomorrow. This effort will build on and complement ongoing local and Federal economic and workforce-development efforts through a Task Force composed of senior-level Administration officials from relevant agencies that will construct an economic development action plan by August 15, 2010.</p>
<p class="note-body">To these ends, I hereby direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Establishment of the Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development</em>.

The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Membership of the Task Force</em>. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Administration</em>. The Co-Chairs shall convene regular meetings of the Task Force, determine its agenda, and direct its work. At the direction of the Co-Chairs, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Mission and Functions</em>. The Task Force shall work with local stakeholders and executive departments and agencies to equip Space Coast and other affected workers to take advantage of new opportunities and expand the region's economic base.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Task Force will perform the following functions, to the extent permitted by law:</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) provide recommendations to the President on ways Federal policies and programs can address issues of special importance to aerospace communities and workers; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) help ensure that officials from throughout the executive branch, including officials on existing committees or task forces addressing technological development, research, or aerospace issues, advance the President's agenda for the transformation of America's space exploration program and support the coordination of Federal economic adjustment assistance activities.</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) details a coordinated implementation strategy by executive departments and agencies to meet the objectives of the Task Force.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) establish appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that all tests which indicate the use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance by any individual shall be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable of providing quantitative data regarding alcohol or a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen sample be subdivided, secured, and labelled in the presence of the tested individual and that a portion thereof be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that in the event the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained portion assayed by a confirmation test done independently at a second certified laboratory if the individual requests the independent test within 3 days after being advised of the results of the initial confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations as may be necessary and in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services;</p>
