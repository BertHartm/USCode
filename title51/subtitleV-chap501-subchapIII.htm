<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Federal Government shall <!-- PDFPage:65 -->acquire space transportation services from United States commercial providers whenever such services are required in the course of its activities. To the maximum extent practicable, the Federal Government shall plan missions to accommodate the space transportation services capabilities of United States commercial providers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Government shall not be required to acquire space transportation services under subsection (a) if, on a case-by-case basis, the Administrator or, in the case of a national security issue, the Secretary of the Air Force, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a payload requires the unique capabilities of the space shuttle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cost effective space transportation services that meet specific mission requirements would not be reasonably available from United States commercial providers when required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers poses an unacceptable risk of loss of a unique scientific opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers is inconsistent with national security objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers is inconsistent with international agreements for international collaborative efforts relating to science and technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) it is more cost effective to transport a payload in conjunction with a test or demonstration of a space transportation vehicle owned by the Federal Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a payload can make use of the available cargo space on a space shuttle mission as a secondary payload, and such payload is consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Agreements With Foreign Entities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall prevent the Administrator from planning or negotiating agreements with foreign entities for the launch of Federal Government payloads for international collaborative efforts relating to science and technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Delayed Effect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) shall not apply to space transportation services and space transportation vehicles acquired or owned by the Federal Government before October 28, 1998, or with respect to which a contract for such acquisition or ownership has been entered into before October 28, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Historical Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section shall not be construed to prohibit the Federal Government from acquiring, owning, or maintaining space transportation vehicles solely for historical display purposes.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall prepare for an orderly transition from the Federal operation, or Federal management of contracted operation, of space transportation systems to the Federal purchase of commercial space transportation services for all nonemergency space transportation requirements for transportation to and from Earth orbit, including human, cargo, and mixed payloads. In those preparations, the Administrator shall take into account the need for short-term economies, as well as the goal of restoring the Administration's research focus and its mandate to promote the fullest possible commercial use of space. As part of those preparations, the Administrator shall plan for the potential privatization of the space shuttle program. Such plan shall keep safety and cost effectiveness as high priorities. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Administration from studying, designing, developing, or funding upgrades or modifications essential to the safe and economical operation of the space shuttle fleet.</p>
