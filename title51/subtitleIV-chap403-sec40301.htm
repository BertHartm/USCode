<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;147, title II, &sect;202, Oct. 30, 1987, 101 Stat. 869, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the vitality of the Nation and the quality of life of the citizens of the Nation depend increasingly on the understanding, assessment, development, and utilization of space resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) research and development of space science, space technology, and space commercialization will contribute to the quality of life, national security, and the enhancement of commerce;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the understanding and development of the space frontiers require a broad commitment and an intense involvement on the part of the Federal Government in partnership with State and local governments, private industry, universities, organizations, and individuals concerned with the exploration and utilization of space;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, through the national space grant college and fellowship program, offers the most suitable means for such commitment and involvement through the promotion of activities that will result in greater understanding, assessment, development, and utilization; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Federal support of the establishment, development, and operation of programs and projects by space grant colleges, space grant regional consortia, institutions of higher education, institutes, laboratories, and other appropriate public and private entities is the most cost-effective way to promote such activities.&rdquo;</p>
