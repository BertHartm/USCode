<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(3), the words &ldquo;without regard to the date on which the Administration entered into the waiver&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;without regard to whether it was entered into before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act&rdquo; to avoid an ambiguity in the law. Literally, the words &ldquo;the date of enactment of this Act&rdquo; mean July 29, 1958, the date of enactment of Public Law 85&ndash;568. However, the intended meaning of the words &ldquo;the date of enactment of this Act&rdquo; is probably October 20, 1999, the date of enactment of Public Law 106&ndash;74. The question as to which date is actually intended is rendered inconsequential by the words &ldquo;before, on, or after&rdquo;.</p>
