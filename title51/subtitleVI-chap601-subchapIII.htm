<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such data are generated by a system for which all or a substantial part of the development, fabrication, launch, or operations costs have been or will be directly funded by the United States Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is in the interest of the United States to require such data to be provided by the licensee consistent with section 60122(b)(3) of this title, after considering the impact on the licensee and the importance of promoting widespread access to remote sensing data from United States and foreign systems.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Consistency with contract or other arrangement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A designation made by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall not be inconsistent with any contract or other arrangement entered into between a United States Government agency and the licensee.</p>
