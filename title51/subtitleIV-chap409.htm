<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology programs will serve as the fulcrum for future initiatives by the United States in civil space and aviation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) colleges and universities in many States are currently not able to compete successfully for research grants awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration through its space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) balanced programs of space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology should include initiatives designed to foster competitive research capacity in all geographic areas of the Nation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) by strengthening the competitive research capacity in those geographic areas of the Nation which are not currently fully competitive, the education and training of scientists and engineers important to the future of the United States civil space and aviation programs will be fostered.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration], in planning for national programs in space science and applications, aeronautical research, space flight, and exploration, should ensure the resilience of the space and aeronautics research infrastructure;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a stable and balanced program of space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology should include programs to assure that geographic areas of the United States that currently do not successfully participate in competitive space and aeronautical research activities are enabled to become more competitive; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) programs to improve competitive capabilities should be a part of the research and the educational activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.&rdquo;</p>
