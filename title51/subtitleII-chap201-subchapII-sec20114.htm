<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;through the President&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;through the Liaison Committee&rdquo; because the Civilian-Military Liaison Committee, which was established by section 204(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2474(a)), was abolished and its functions, together with the functions of its chairman and other officers, were transferred to the President by sections 1(e) and 3(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1965 (5 App. U.S.C.).</p>
<p class="note-body"> In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;as provided in section 201 (e)&rdquo;, which appeared at the end of the subsection, are omitted as obsolete. Section 201 of Public Law 85&ndash;568, which was classified to former section 2471 of title 42 (last appearing in the 1970 edition of the United States Code), established the National Aeronautics and Space Council, with the functions of the Council specified in section 201(e). Those functions included advising the President &ldquo;as he may request&rdquo; with respect to promoting cooperation and resolving differences among agencies of the United States engaged in aeronautical and space activities. The words are obsolete because section 3(a)(4) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1973 (5 App. U.S.C.), abolished the National Aeronautics and Space Council, including the office of Executive Secretary of the Council, together with its functions.</p>
