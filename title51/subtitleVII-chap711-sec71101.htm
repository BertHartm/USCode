<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;422, title VIII, &sect;802, Oct. 15, 2008, 122 Stat. 4803, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects&rsquo; closest approach to Earth and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Asteroid and comet collisions rank as one of the most costly natural disasters that can occur.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The time needed to eliminate or mitigate the threat of a collision of a potentially hazardous near-Earth object with Earth is measured in decades.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets can provide adequate collision information, enabling the United States to include both asteroid-collision and comet-collision disaster recovery and disaster avoidance in its public-safety structure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Basic information is needed for technical and policy decisionmaking for the United States to create a comprehensive program in order to be ready to eliminate and mitigate the serious and credible threats to humankind posed by potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) As a first step to eliminate and to mitigate the risk of such collisions, situation and decision analysis processes, as well as procedures and system resources, must be in place well before a collision threat becomes known.&rdquo;</p>
