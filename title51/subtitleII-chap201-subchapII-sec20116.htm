<p class="note-body">In subsections (a)(2) and (b), the words &ldquo;section 102(c) of this Act&rdquo;, which appear in section 206 of Public Law 85&ndash;568 (72 Stat. 432), are treated as referring to section 102(d), rather than section 102(c), of Public Law 85&ndash;568 because of the redesignation done by section 110(a)(2) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1985 (Public Law 98&ndash;361, 98 Stat. 426). Section 102(d) of Public Law 85&ndash;568 is restated as section 20102(d) of title 51.</p>
