<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Third party</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;third party&rdquo; means any person who may institute a claim against a user for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>User</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;user&rdquo; includes anyone who enters into an agreement with the Administration for use of all or a portion of a space vehicle, who owns or provides property to be flown on a space vehicle, or who employs a person to be flown on a space vehicle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administration is authorized on such terms and to the extent it may deem appropriate to provide liability insurance for any user of a space vehicle to compensate all or a portion of claims by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from activities carried on in connection with the launch, operations, or recovery of the space vehicle. Appropriations available to the Administration may be used to acquire such insurance, but such appropriations shall be reimbursed to the maximum extent practicable by the users under reimbursement policies established pursuant to section 20113 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Indemnification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under such regulations in conformity with this section as the Administrator shall prescribe taking into account the availability, cost, and terms of liability insurance, any agreement between the Administration and a user of a space vehicle may provide that the United States will indemnify the user against claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from activities carried on in connection with the launch, operations, or recovery of the space vehicle, but only to the extent that such claims are not compensated by liability insurance of the user.
