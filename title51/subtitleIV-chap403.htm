<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) increase the understanding, assessment, development, and utilization of space resources by promoting a strong educational base, responsive research and training activities, and broad and prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) utilize the abilities and talents of the universities of the Nation to support and contribute to the exploration and development of the resources and opportunities afforded by the space environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage and support, within the university community of the Nation, the existence of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary programs of space research that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) engage in integrated activities of training, research, and public service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have cooperative programs with industry; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are coordinated with the overall program of the Administration;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
