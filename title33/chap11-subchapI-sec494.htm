<p class="note-body">Section would seem to supersede a provision of act Aug. 7, 1882, ch. 433, &sect;1, 22 Stat. 309, which read as follows: &ldquo;That all parties owning, occupying, or operating bridges over any navigable river shall maintain at their own expense, from sunset to sunrise, throughout the year, such lights on their bridges as may be required by the Light-House Board for the security of navigation: and in addition thereto all persons owning, occupying, or operating any bridge over any navigable river shall, in any event, maintain all lights on their bridge that may be necessary for the security of navigation.&rdquo;</p>
