<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) although fishery products provide an important source of protein and industrial products for United States consumption, United States fishery production annually falls far short of satisfying United States demand;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) escalated energy costs have had a negative effect on the economics of United States commercial and recreational fisheries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) commercial and recreational fisheries are a prominent factor in United States coastal economies and the direct and indirect returns to the United States economy from commercial and recreational fishing expenditures are threefold; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) properly designed, constructed, and located artificial reefs in waters covered under this chapter can enhance the habitat and diversity of fishery resources; enhance United States recreational and commercial fishing opportunities; increase the production of fishery products in the United States; increase the energy efficiency of recreational and commercial fisheries; and contribute to the United States and coastal economies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purpose of this chapter is to promote and facilitate responsible and effective efforts to establish artificial reefs in waters covered under this chapter.</p>
