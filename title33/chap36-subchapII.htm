<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2232. Construction of projects by non-Federal interests</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to projects undertaken pursuant to sections 201 and 202 of this title, any non-Federal interest is authorized to undertake navigational improvements in harbors or inland harbors of the United States, subject to obtaining any permits required pursuant to Federal and State laws in advance of the actual construction of such improvements.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:591 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Studies and engineering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When requested by an appropriate non-Federal interest the Secretary is authorized to undertake all necessary studies and engineering for any construction to be undertaken under the terms of subsection (a) of this section, and provide technical assistance in obtaining all necessary permits, if the non-Federal interest contracts with the Secretary to furnish the United States funds for such studies and engineering during the period that they are conducted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Completion of studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to complete and transmit to the appropriate non-Federal interest any study for improvements to harbors or inland harbors of the United States which were initiated prior to November 17, 1986, or, upon the request of such non-Federal interest, to terminate such study and transmit such partially completed study to the non-Federal interest. The Secretary is further authorized to complete and transmit to the appropriate non-Federal interest any study for improvement to harbors or inland harbors of the United States that is initiated pursuant to section 577 of this title or, upon request of such non-Federal interest, to terminate such study and transmit such partially completed study to the non-Federal interest. Studies under this subsection shall be completed without regard to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority to carry out improvement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any non-Federal interest which has requested and received from the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the completed study and engineering for an improvement to a harbor or an inland harbor, or separable element thereof, for the purpose of constructing such improvement and for which improvement a final environmental impact statement has been filed, shall be authorized to carry out the terms of the plan for such improvement. Any plan of improvement proposed to be implemented in accordance with this subsection shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for obtaining the appropriate permits required under the Secretary's authority and such permits shall be granted subject to the non-Federal interest's acceptance of the terms and conditions of such permits: Provided, That the Secretary determines that the applicable regulatory criteria and procedures have been satisfied. The Secretary shall monitor any project for which permits are granted under this subsection in order to ensure that such project is constructed (and, in those cases where such activities will not be the responsibility of the Secretary, operated and maintained) in accordance with the terms and conditions of such permits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the enactment of appropriation Acts, the Secretary is authorized to reimburse any non-Federal interest an amount equal to the estimate of Federal share, without interest, of the cost of any authorized harbor or inland harbor improvement, or separable element thereof, including any small navigation project approved pursuant to section 577 of this title, constructed under the terms of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) after authorization of the project (or, in the case of a small navigation project, after completion of a favorable project report by the Corps of Engineers) and before initiation of construction of the project or separable element&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary approves the plans of construction of such project by such non-Federal interest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such non-Federal interest enters into an agreement to pay the non-Federal share, if any, of the cost of operation and maintenance of such project; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary finds before approval of the plans of construction of the project that the project, or separable element, is economically justified and environmentally acceptable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Matters to be considered in reviewing plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In reviewing such plans, the Secretary shall consider budgetary and programmatic priorities, potential impacts on the cost of dredging projects nationwide, and other factors that the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall regularly monitor and audit any project for a harbor or inland harbor constructed under this subsection by a non-Federal interest in order to ensure that such construction is in compliance with the plans approved by the Secretary, and that costs are reasonable. No reimbursement shall be made unless and until the Secretary has certified that the work for which reimbursement is requested has been performed in accordance with applicable permits and the approved plans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Operation and maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a non-Federal interest constructs improvements to any harbor or inland harbor, the Secretary shall be responsible for maintenance in accordance with section 2211(b) of this title if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary determines, before construction, that the improvements, or separable elements thereof, are economically justified, environmentally acceptable, and consistent with the purposes of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary certifies that the project is constructed in accordance with applicable permits and the appropriate engineering and design standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary does not find that the project, or separable element thereof, is no longer economically justified or environmentally acceptable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Demonstration of non-Federal interests acting as agent of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of demonstrating the potential advantages and efficiencies of non-Federal management of projects, the Secretary may approve as many as two proposals pursuant to which the non-Federal interests will undertake part or all of a harbor project authorized by Congress as the agent of the Secretary by utiliz<!-- PDFPage:592 -->ing its own personnel or by procuring outside services, so long as the cost of doing so will not exceed the cost of the Secretary undertaking the project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the following conditions, a non-Federal interest may levy port or harbor dues (in the form of tonnage duties or fees) on a vessel engaged in trade entering or departing from a harbor and on cargo loaded on or unloaded from that vessel under clauses 2 and 3 of section 10, and under clause 3 of section 8, of Article 1 of the Constitution:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Port or harbor dues may be levied only in conjunction with a harbor navigation project whose construction is complete (including a usable increment of the project) and for the following purposes and in amounts not to exceed those necessary to carry out those purposes:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) to finance the non-Federal share of construction and operation and maintenance costs of a navigation project for a harbor under the requirements of section 2211 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to finance the cost of construction and operation and maintenance of a navigation project for a harbor under section 2232 or 2233 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide emergency response services in the harbor, including contingency planning, necessary personnel training, and the procurement of equipment and facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on port or harbor dues for emergency service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Port or harbor dues may not be levied for the purposes described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection after the dues cease to be levied for the purposes described in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) General limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Port or harbor dues may not be levied under this section in conjunction with a deepening feature of a navigation improvement project on any vessel if that vessel, based on its design draft, could have utilized the project at mean low water before construction. In the case of project features which solely&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) widen channels or harbors,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) create or enlarge bend easings, turning basins or anchorage areas, or provide protected areas, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">only vessels at least comparable in size to those used to justify these features may be charged under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In developing port or harbor dues that may be charged under this section on vessels for project features constructed under this subchapter, the non-Federal interest may con<!-- PDFPage:594 -->sider such criteria as: elapsed time of passage, safety of passage, vessel economy of scale, under keel clearance, vessel draft, vessel squat, vessel speed, sinkage, and trim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Port or harbor dues authorized by this section shall not be imposed on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) vessels owned and operated by the United States Government, a foreign country, a State, or a political subdivision of a country or State, unless engaged in commercial services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Port or harbor dues may be levied only on a vessel entering or departing from a harbor and its cargo on a fair and equitable basis. In formulating port and harbor dues, the non-Federal interest shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the direct and indirect cost of construction, operations, and maintenance, and providing the facilities and services under paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
