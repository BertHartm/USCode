<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Keeping out of the way</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) when each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) when both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) if a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel <!-- PDFPage:548 -->has the wind on the port or on the starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Windward side</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this Rule the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.</p>
