<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2034. Maneuvering and warning signals (Rule 34)</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Whistle signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When power-driven vessels are in sight of one another and meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other, each vessel underway, when maneuvering as authorized or required by these Rules:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall indicate that maneuver by the following signals on her whistle: one short blast to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my port side&rdquo;; two short blasts to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my starboard side&rdquo;; and three short blasts to mean &ldquo;I am operating astern propulsion&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) upon hearing the one or two blast signal of the other shall, if in agreement, sound the same whistle signal and take the steps necessary to effect a safe passing. If, however, from any cause, the vessel doubts the safety of the proposed maneuver, she shall sound the danger signal specified in paragraph (d) of this Rule and each vessel shall take appropriate precautionary action until a safe passing agreement is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Light signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule by light signals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) These signals shall have the following significance: one flash to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my port side&rdquo;; two flashes to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my starboard side&rdquo;; three flashes to mean &ldquo;I am operating astern propulsion&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The duration of each flash shall be about 1 second; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The light used for this signal shall, if fitted, be one all-round white or yellow light, visible at a minimum range of 2 miles, synchronized with the whistle, and shall comply with the provisions of Annex I to these Rules.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Overtaking situations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in sight of one another:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a power-driven vessel intending to overtake another power-driven vessel shall indicate her intention by the following signals on her whistle: one short blast to mean &ldquo;I intend to overtake you on your starboard side&rdquo;; two short blasts to mean &ldquo;I intend to overtake you on your port side&rdquo;; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the power-driven vessel about to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound a similar sound signal. If in doubt she shall sound the danger signal prescribed in paragraph (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Doubts or failure to understand signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and from any cause either vessel fails to understand the intentions or actions of the other, or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision, the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. This signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least five short and rapid flashes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Vessels in areas of obscured visibility due to intervening obstructions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound one prolonged blast. This signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching ves<!-- PDFPage:527 -->sel that may be within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Use of one whistle only on a vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, one whistle only shall be used for giving maneuvering and warning signals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Power-driven vessels leaving dock or berth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a power-driven vessel is leaving a dock or berth, she shall sound one prolonged blast.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Agreement between vessels using radiotelephone</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel that reaches agreement with another vessel in a meeting, crossing, or overtaking situation by using the radiotelephone as prescribed by the Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act (85 Stat. 165; 33 U.S.C. 1207) [33 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.], is not obliged to sound the whistle signals prescribed by this Rule, but may do so. If agreement is not reached, then whistle signals shall be exchanged in a timely manner and shall prevail.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In or near an area of restricted visibility, whether by day or night, the signals prescribed in this Rule shall be used as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Power-driven vessels making way through the water</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A power-driven vessel making way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes one prolonged blast.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Power-driven vessels underway but stopped and making no way through the water</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A power-driven vessel underway but stopped and making no way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes two prolonged blasts in succession with an interval of about 2 seconds between them.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Vessels not under command; vessels restricted in ability to maneuver; sailing vessels; vessels engaged in fishing; vessels engaged in towing or pushing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel not under command; a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver, whether underway or at anchor; a sailing vessel; a vessel engaged in fishing, whether underway or at anchor; and a vessel engaged in towing or pushing another vessel shall, instead of the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule, sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes, three blasts in succession; namely, one prolonged followed by two short blasts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Vessels towed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel towed or if more than one vessel is towed the last vessel of the tow, if manned, shall at intervals of not more than 2 minutes sound four blasts in succession; namely, one prolonged followed by three short blasts. When practicable, this signal shall be made immediately after the signal made by the towing vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Pushing and pushed vessels connected in composite unit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit they shall be regarded as a power-driven vessel and shall give the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Vessels at anchor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel at anchor shall at intervals of not more than 1 minute ring the bell rapidly for about 5 seconds. In a vessel of 100 meters or more in length the bell shall be sounded in the forepart of the vessel and immediately after the ringing of the bell the gong shall be sounded rapidly for about 5 seconds in the after part of the vessel. A vessel at anchor may in addition sound three blasts in succession; namely, one short, one prolonged and one short blast, to give warning of her position and of the possibility of collision to an approaching vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Vessels aground</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel aground shall give the bell signal and if required the gong signal prescribed in paragraph (f) of this Rule and shall, in addition, give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the bell. A vessel aground may in addition sound an appropriate whistle signal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Vessels of less than 12 meters in length</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel of less than 12 meters in length shall not be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals but, if she does not, shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than 2 minutes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Pilot vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A pilot vessel when engaged on pilotage duty may in addition to the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) or (f) of this Rule sound an identity signal consisting of four short blasts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Vessels anchored in special anchorage areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following vessels shall not be required to sound signals as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this Rule when anchored in a special anchorage area designated by the Secretary:</p>
