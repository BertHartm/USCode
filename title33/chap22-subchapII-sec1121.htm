<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The national interest requires a strategy to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide for the understanding and wise use of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources and the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) foster economic competitiveness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promote public stewardship and wise economic development of the coastal ocean and its margins, the Great Lakes, and the exclusive economic zone;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) encourage the development of forecast and analysis systems for coastal hazards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) understand global environmental processes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) promote domestic and international cooperative solutions to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes issues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Investment in a strong program of research, education, training, technology transfer, and public service is essential for this strategy.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:282 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The expanding use and development of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources resulting from growing coastal area populations and the increasing pressures on the coastal and Great Lakes environment challenge the ability of the United States to manage such resources wisely.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The vitality of the Nation and the quality of life of its citizens depend increasingly on the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources. These resources supply food, energy, and minerals and contribute to human health, the quality of the environment, national security, and the enhancement of commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of such resources require a broad commitment and an intense involvement on the part of the Federal Government in continuing partnership with State and local governments, private industry, universities, organizations, and individuals concerned with or affected by ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the national sea grant college program, offers the most suitable locus and means for such commitment and involvement through the promotion of activities that will result in greater such understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation. The most cost-effective way to promote such activities is through continued and increased Federal support of the establishment, development, and operation of programs and projects by sea grant colleges, sea grant institutes, and other institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The objective of this subchapter is to increase the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the Nation's ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources by providing assistance to promote a strong educational base, responsive research and training activities, broad and prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques, and multidisciplinary approaches to environmental problems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of the Congress to achieve the objective of this subchapter by extending and strengthening the national sea grant program, initially established in 1966, to promote research, education, training, and advisory service activities in fields related to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources.</p>
