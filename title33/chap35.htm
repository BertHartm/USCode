<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) although fishery products provide an important source of protein and industrial products for United States consumption, United States fishery production annually falls far short of satisfying United States demand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) overfishing and the degradation of vital fishery resource habitats have caused a reduction in the abundance and diversity of United States fishery resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) escalated energy costs have had a negative effect on the economics of United States commercial and recreational fisheries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) commercial and recreational fisheries are a prominent factor in United States coastal economies and the direct and indirect returns to the United States economy from commercial and recreational fishing expenditures are threefold; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) properly designed, constructed, and located artificial reefs in waters covered under this chapter can enhance the habitat and diversity of fishery resources; enhance United States recreational and commercial fishing opportunities; increase the production of fishery products in the United States; increase the energy efficiency of recreational and commercial fisheries; and contribute to the United States and coastal economies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purpose of this chapter is to promote and facilitate responsible and effective efforts to establish artificial reefs in waters covered under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In issuing a permit for artificial reefs under section 403 of this title, section 1344 of this title, or section 1333(e) of title 43, the Secretary of the Army (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consult with and consider the views of appropriate Federal agencies, States, local governments, and other interested parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) ensure that the provisions for siting, constructing, monitoring, and managing the artificial reef are consistent with the criteria and standards established under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure that the title to the artificial reef construction material is unambiguous, and <!-- PDFPage:578 -->that responsibility for maintenance and the financial ability to assume liability for future damages are clearly established; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the plan developed under section 2103 of this title and notify the Secretary of Commerce of any need to deviate from that plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions of permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each permit issued by the Secretary subject to this section shall specify the design and location for construction of the artificial reef and the types and quantities of materials that may be used in constructing such artificial reef. In addition, each such permit shall specify such terms and conditions for the construction, operation, maintenance, monitoring, and managing the use of the artificial reef as are necessary for compliance with all applicable provisions of law and as are necessary to ensure the protection of the environment and human safety and property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before issuing a permit under section 1342 of this title for any activity relating to the siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, monitoring, or managing of an artificial reef, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consult with the Secretary to ensure that such permit is consistent with any permit issued by the Secretary subject to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability of permittee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person to whom a permit is issued in accordance with subsection (a) of this section and any insurer of that person shall not be liable for damages caused by activities required to be undertaken under any terms and conditions of the permit, if the permittee is in compliance with such terms and conditions.</p>

The amount of the civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary by written notice.
