This subchapter does not apply to any such barrier which is not in excess of six feet in height, regardless of storage capacity or which has a storage capacity at maximum water storage elevation not in excess of fifteen acre-feet, regardless of height, unless such barrier, due to its location or other physical characteristics, is likely to pose a significant threat to human life or property in the event of its failure.</p>
