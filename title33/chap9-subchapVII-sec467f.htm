<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Army (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;), $13,000,000 for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1988, through September 30, 1994. Sums appropriated under this section shall be distributed annually among States on the following basis: One-third equally among those States that have established dam safety programs approved under the terms of section 467g of this title, and two-thirds in proportion to the number of dams located in each State that has an established dam safety program under the terms of section 467g of this title to the number of dams in all States with such approved programs. In no event shall funds distributed to any State under this section exceed 50 percent of the reasonable cost of implementing an approved dam safety program in such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No grant may be made to a State under this section in any fiscal year unless such State enters into such agreements with the Secretary as the Secretary may require to ensure that such State will maintain its aggregate expenditures from all other sources for programs to assure dam safety for the protection of human life and property at or above the average level of such expenditures in its two fiscal years preceding November 17, 1986.</p>
