<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Management conference</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nomination of estuaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Governor of any State may nominate to the Administrator an estuary lying in whole or in part within the State as an estuary of national significance and request a management conference to develop a comprehensive management plan for the estuary. The nomination shall document the need for the conference, the likelihood of success, and information relating to the factors in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Convening of conference</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case where the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon nom<!-- PDFPage:452 -->ination of a State under paragraph (1), that the attainment or maintenance of that water quality in an estuary which assures protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife, and allows recreational activities, in and on the water, requires the control of point and nonpoint sources of pollution to supplement existing controls of pollution in more than one State, the Administrator shall select such estuary and convene a management conference.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Priority consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall give priority consideration under this section to Long Island Sound, New York and Connecticut; Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island; Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts; Massachusetts Bay, Massachusetts (including Cape Cod Bay and Boston Harbor); Puget Sound, Washington; New York-New Jersey Harbor, New York and New Jersey; Delaware Bay, Delaware and New Jersey; Delaware Inland Bays, Delaware; Albemarle Sound, North Carolina; Sarasota Bay, Florida; San Francisco Bay, California; Santa Monica Bay, California; Galveston Bay, Texas; Barataria-Terrebonne Bay estuary complex, Louisiana; Indian River Lagoon, Florida; Lake Pontchartrain Basin, Louisiana and Mississippi; and Peconic Bay, New York.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Boundary dispute exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which a boundary between two States passes through an estuary and such boundary is disputed and is the subject of an action in any court, the Administrator shall not convene a management conference with respect to such estuary before a final adjudication has been made of such dispute.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes of conference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of any management conference convened with respect to an estuary under this subsection shall be to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assess trends in water quality, natural resources, and uses of the estuary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) collect, characterize, and assess data on toxics, nutrients, and natural resources within the estuarine zone to identify the causes of environmental problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) develop the relationship between the inplace loads and point and nonpoint loadings of pollutants to the estuarine zone and the potential uses of the zone, water quality, and natural resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) develop a comprehensive conservation and management plan that recommends priority corrective actions and compliance schedules addressing point and nonpoint sources of pollution to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the estuary, including restoration and maintenance of water quality, a balanced indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife, and recreational activities in the estuary, and assure that the designated uses of the estuary are protected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) develop plans for the coordinated implementation of the plan by the States as well as Federal and local agencies participating in the conference;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 1002. DEFINITION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;For purposes of this title [amending section 1330 of this title and enacting provisions set out as notes under sections 1251 and 1330 of this title], the term &lsquo;Massachusetts Bay&rsquo; includes Massachusetts Bay, Cape Cod Bay, and Boston Harbor, consisting of an area extending from Cape Ann, Massachusetts south to the northern reach of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 1003. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Massachusetts Bay comprises a single major estuarine and oceanographic system extending from Cape Ann, Massachusetts south to the northern reaches of Cape Cod, encompassing Boston Harbor, Massachusetts Bay, and Cape Cod Bay;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) several major riverine systems, including the Charles, Neponset, and Mystic Rivers, drain the watersheds of eastern Massachusetts into the Bay;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the shorelines of Massachusetts Bay, first occupied in the middle 1600's, are home to over 4 million people and support a thriving industrial and recreational economy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Massachusetts Bay supports important commercial fisheries, including lobsters, finfish, and shellfisheries, and is home to or frequented by several endangered species and marine mammals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Massachusetts Bay also constitutes an important recreational resource, providing fishing, swimming, and boating opportunities to the region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) rapidly expanding coastal populations and pollution pose increasing threats to the long-term health and integrity of Massachusetts Bay;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) while the cleanup of Boston Harbor will contribute significantly to improving the overall environmental quality of Massachusetts Bay, expanded efforts encompassing the entire ecosystem will be necessary to ensure its long-term health;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the concerted efforts of all levels of Government, the private sector, and the public at large will be necessary to protect and enhance the environmental integrity of Massachusetts Bay; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the designation of Massachusetts Bay as an Estuary of National Significance and the development of a comprehensive plan for protecting and restoring the Bay may contribute significantly to its long-term health and environmental integrity.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this title is to protect and enhance the environmental quality of Massachusetts Bay by providing for its designation as an Estuary of National Significance and by providing for the preparation of a comprehensive restoration plan for the Bay.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 1005. FUNDING SOURCES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Within one year of enactment [Nov. 14, 1988], the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Governor of Massachusetts shall undertake to identify and make available sources of funding to support activities pertaining to Massachusetts Bay undertaken pursuant to or authorized by section 320 of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1330], and shall make every effort to coordinate existing research, monitoring or control efforts with such activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) the Nation's estuaries are of great importance for fish and wildlife resources and recreation and economic opportunity;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) maintaining the health and ecological integrity of these estuaries is in the national interest;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) increasing coastal population, development, and other direct and indirect uses of these estuaries threaten their health and ecological integrity;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) long-term planning and management will contribute to the continued productivity of these areas, and will maximize their utility to the Nation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(E) better coordination among Federal and State programs affecting estuaries will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the national effort to protect, preserve, and restore these areas.</p>
