<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application area; publication in Federal Register; &ldquo;application area&rdquo; defined; submission of other applications; notice of intent and submission of completed applications; denial of pending application prior to consideration of other untimely applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the time notice of an application is published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall publish a description in the Federal Register of an application area encompassing the deepwater port site proposed by such application and within which construction of the proposed deepwater port would eliminate, at the time such application was submitted, the need for any other deepwater port within that application area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this section, &ldquo;application area&rdquo; means any reasonable geographical area within which a deepwater port may be constructed and operated. Such application area shall not exceed a circular zone, the center of which is the principal point of loading and unloading at the port, and the radius of which is the distance from such point to the high water mark of the nearest adjacent coastal State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall accompany such publication with a call for submission of any other applications for licenses for the ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port within the designated application area. Persons intending to file applications for such license shall submit a notice of intent to file an application with the Secretary not later than 60 days after the publication of notice pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and shall submit the completed application no later than 90 days after publication of such notice. The Secretary shall publish notice of any such application received in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. No application for a license for the ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port within the designated application area for which a notice of intent to file was received after such 60-day period, or which is received after such 90-day period has elapsed, shall be considered until the application pending with respect to such application area have been denied pursuant to this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application filed with the Secretary shall constitute an application for all Federal authorizations required for ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port. At the time notice of any application is published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall forward a copy of such application to those Federal agencies and departments with jurisdiction over any aspect of such ownership, construction, or operation for comment, review, or recommendation as to conditions and for such other action as may be required by law. Each agency or department involved shall review the application and, based upon legal considerations within its area of responsibility, recommend to the Secretary, the approval or disapproval of the application not later than 45 days after the last public hearing on a proposed license for a designated application area. In any case in which the agency or department recommends disapproval, it shall set forth in detail the manner in which the application does not comply with any law or regulation within its area of responsibility and shall notify the Secretary how the application may be amended so as to bring it into compliance with the law or regulation involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For all timely applications covering a single application area, the Secretary, in cooperation with other involved Federal agencies and departments, shall, pursuant to section 4332(2)(C) of title 42, prepare a single, detailed environmental impact statement, which shall fulfill the requirement of all Federal agencies in carrying out their responsibilities pursuant to this chapter to prepare an environmental impact statement.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Public notice and hearings; evidentiary hearing in District of Columbia; decision of Secretary based on evidentiary record; consolidation of hearings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A license may be issued only after public notice and public hearings in accordance with this subsection. At least one such public hearing shall be held in each adjacent coastal State. Any interested person may present relevant material at any hearing. After hearings in each adjacent coastal State are concluded if the Secretary determines that there exists one or more specific and material factual issues which may be resolved by a formal evidentiary hearing, at least one adjudicatory hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of section 554 of title 5 in the District of Columbia. The record developed in any such adjudicatory hearing shall be basis for the Secretary's decision to approve or deny a license. Hearings held pursuant to this subsection shall be consolidated insofar as practicable with hearings held by other agencies.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an adjacent coastal State may fix reasonable fees for the use of a deepwater port facility, and such State and any other State in which land-based facilities directly related to a deepwater port facility are located may set reasonable fees for the use of such land-based facilities. Fees may be fixed under authority of this paragraph as compensation for any economic cost attributable to the construction and operation of such deepwater port and such land-based facilities, which cannot be recovered under other authority of such State or political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, and for environmental and administrative costs attributable to the construction and operation of such deepwater port and such land-based facilities. Fees under this paragraph shall not exceed such economic, environmental, and administrative costs of such State. Such fees shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary. As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;land-based facilities directly related to a deepwater port facility&rdquo; means the onshore tank farm and pipelines connecting such tank farm to the deepwater port facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A licensee shall pay annually in advance the fair market rental value (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) of the subsoil and seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States to be utilized by the deepwater port, including the fair market rental value of the right-of-way necessary for the pipeline segment of the port located on such subsoil and seabed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to an adjacent coastal State (or combination of States), any political subdivision thereof, or agency or instrumentality, including a wholly owned corporation of any such government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to a person who is neither (i) engaged in producing, refining, or marketing oil, nor (ii) an affiliate of any person who is engaged in producing, refining, or marketing oil or an affiliate of any such affiliate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to any other person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining whether any one proposed deepwater port clearly best serves the national interest, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the degree to which the proposed deepwater ports affect the environment, as determined under criteria established pursuant to section 1505 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any significant differences between anticipated completion dates for the proposed deepwater ports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any differences in costs of construction and operation of the proposed deepwater ports, to the extent that such differential may significantly affect the ultimate cost of oil to the consumer.</p>
