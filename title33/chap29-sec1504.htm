<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this section, &ldquo;application area&rdquo; means any reasonable geographical area within which a deepwater port may be constructed and operated. Such application area shall not exceed a circular zone, the center of which is the principal point of loading and unloading at the port, and the radius of which is the distance from such point to the high water mark of the nearest adjacent coastal State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application filed with the Secretary shall constitute an application for all Federal authorizations required for ownership, construction, and operation of a deepwater port. At the time notice of any application is published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall forward a copy of such application to those Federal agencies and departments with jurisdiction over any aspect of such ownership, construction, or operation for comment, review, or recommendation as to conditions and for such other action as may be required by law. Each agency or department involved shall review the application and, based upon legal considerations within its area of responsibility, recommend to the Secretary, the approval or disapproval of the application not later than 45 days after the last public hearing on a proposed license for a designated application area.

The record developed in any such adjudicatory hearing shall be basis for the Secretary's decision to approve or deny a license. Hearings held pursuant to this subsection shall be consolidated insofar as practicable with hearings held by other agencies. All public hearings on all applications for any designated application area shall be consolidated and shall be concluded not later than 240 days after notice of the initial application has been published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and unless prohibited by law, an adjacent coastal State may fix reasonable fees for the use of a deepwater port facility, and such State and any other State in which land-based facilities directly related to a deepwater port facility are located may set reasonable fees for the use of such land-based facilities. Fees may be fixed under authority of this paragraph as compensation for any economic cost attributable to the construction and operation of such deepwater port and such land-based facilities, which cannot be recovered under other authority of such State or political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, and for environmental and administrative costs attributable to the construction and operation of such deepwater port and such land-based facilities. Fees under this paragraph shall not exceed such economic, environmental, and administrative costs of such State. Such fees shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary. As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;land-based facilities directly related to a deepwater port facility&rdquo; means the onshore tank farm and pipelines connecting such tank farm to the deepwater port facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A licensee shall pay annually in advance the fair market rental value (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) of the subsoil and seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States to be utilized by the deepwater port, including the fair market rental value of the right-of-way necessary for the pipeline segment of the port located on such subsoil and seabed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to any other person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining whether any one proposed deepwater port clearly best serves the national interest, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the degree to which the proposed deepwater ports affect the environment, as determined under criteria established pursuant to section 1505 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any significant differences between anticipated completion dates for the proposed deepwater ports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any differences in costs of construction and operation of the proposed deepwater ports, to the extent that such differential may significantly affect the ultimate cost of oil to the consumer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall approve or deny any application for a deepwater port for natural gas submitted pursuant to this chapter not later than 90 days after the last public hearing on a proposed license.
