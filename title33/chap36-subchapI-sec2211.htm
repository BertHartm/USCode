<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal interests for a navigation project for a harbor or inland harbor, or any separable element thereof, on which a contract for physical construction has not been awarded before November 17, 1986, shall pay, during the period of construction of the project, the following costs associated with general navigation features:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 10 percent of the cost of construction of the portion of the project which has a depth not in excess of 20 feet; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 25 percent of the cost of construction of the portion of the project which has a depth in excess of 20 feet but not in excess of 45 feet; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) 50 percent of the cost of construction of the portion of the project which has a depth in excess of 45 feet.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional 10 percent payment over 30 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall pay an additional 10 percent of the cost of the general navigation features of the project in cash over a period not to exceed 30 years, at an interest rate determined pursuant to section 2216 of this title. The value of lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas provided under paragraph (3) and the costs of relocations borne by the non-Federal interests under paragraph (4) shall be credited toward the payment required under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Lands, easements, and rights-of-way</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided under section 2283(c) of this title, the non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall provide the lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations (other than utility relocations under paragraph (4)), and dredged material disposal areas necessary for the project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Utility relocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall perform or assure the performance of all relocations of utilities necessary to carry out the project, except that in the case of a project for a deep-draft harbor and in the case of a project constructed by non-Federal interests under section 2232 of this title, one-half of the cost of each such relocation shall be borne by the owner of the facility being relocated and one-half of the cost of each such relocation shall be borne by the non-Federal interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Operation and maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal share of the cost of operation and maintenance of each navigation project for a harbor or inland harbor constructed pursuant to this Act shall be 100 percent, except that in the case of a deep-draft harbor, the non-Federal interests shall be responsible for an amount equal to 50 percent of the excess of the cost of the operation and maintenance of such project over the cost which the Secretary determines would be incurred for operation and maintenance of such project if such project had a depth of 45 feet.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Erosion or shoaling attributable to Federal navigation works</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Costs of constructing projects or measures for the prevention or mitigation of erosion or shoaling damages attributable to Federal navigation works shall be shared in the same proportion as the cost sharing provisions applicable to the project causing such erosion or shoaling. The non-Federal interests for the project causing the erosion or shoaling shall agree to operate and maintain such measures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Non-Federal payments during construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any non-Federal share of the cost of any navigation project for a harbor or inland harbor shall be paid to the Secretary. <!-- PDFPage:536 -->Amounts required to be paid during construction shall be paid on an annual basis during the period of construction, beginning not later than one year after construction is initiated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Agreement</h4>
