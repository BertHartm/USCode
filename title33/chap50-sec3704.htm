<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 2 years after March 30, 2009, the Subcommittee shall develop a strategic plan for Federal research and monitoring on ocean acidification that will provide for an assessment of the impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms and marine ecosystems and the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to conserve marine organisms and marine ecosystems. In developing the plan, the Subcommittee shall consider and use information, reports, and studies of ocean acidification that have identified research and monitoring needed to better understand ocean acidification and its <!-- PDFPage:751 -->potential impacts, and recommendations made by the National Academy of Sciences in the review of the plan required under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of the plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide for interdisciplinary research among the ocean sciences, and coordinated research and activities to improve the understanding of ocean chemistry that will affect marine ecosystems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish, for the 10-year period beginning in the year the plan is submitted, the goals and priorities for Federal research and monitoring which will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) advance understanding of ocean acidification and its physical, chemical, and biological impacts on marine organisms and marine ecosystems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) improve the ability to assess the socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide information for the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to conserve marine organisms and marine ecosystems;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) describe specific activities, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) efforts to determine user needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) research activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) monitoring activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) technology and methods development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) data collection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) database development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) modeling activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) assessment of ocean acidification impacts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) participation in international research efforts;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) identify relevant programs and activities of the Federal agencies that contribute to the interagency program directly and indirectly and set forth the role of each Federal agency in implementing the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) consider and utilize, as appropriate, reports and studies conducted by Federal agencies, the National Research Council, or other entities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) make recommendations for the coordination of the ocean acidification research and monitoring activities of the United States with such activities of other nations and international organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) outline budget requirements for Federal ocean acidification research and monitoring and assessment activities to be conducted by each agency under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) identify the monitoring systems and sampling programs currently employed in collecting data relevant to ocean acidification and prioritize additional monitoring systems that may be needed to ensure adequate data collection and monitoring of ocean acidification and its impacts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) describe specific activities designed to facilitate outreach and data and information exchange with stakeholder communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program elements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan shall include at a minimum the following program elements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Monitoring of ocean chemistry and biological impacts associated with ocean acidification at selected coastal and open-ocean monitoring stations, including satellite-based monitoring to characterize&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) marine ecosystems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) changes in marine productivity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) changes in surface ocean chemistry.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Research to understand the species specific physiological responses of marine organisms to ocean acidification, impacts on marine food webs of ocean acidification, and to develop environmental and ecological indices that track marine ecosystem responses to ocean acidification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Modeling to predict changes in the ocean carbon cycle as a function of carbon dioxide and atmosphere-induced changes in temperature, ocean circulation, biogeochemistry, ecosystem and terrestrial input, and modeling to determine impacts on marine ecosystems and individual marine organisms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Technology development and standardization of carbonate chemistry measurements on moorings and autonomous floats.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Assessment of socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to conserve marine organisms and marine ecosystems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) National Academy of Sciences evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to review the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Public participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing the plan, the Subcommittee shall consult with representatives of academic, State, industry and environmental groups. Not later than 90 days before the plan, or any revision thereof, is submitted to the Congress, the plan shall be published in the Federal Register for a public comment period of not less than 60 days.</p>
