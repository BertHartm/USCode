<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Environmental Protection Agency permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in relation to dredged material, as provided for in section 1413 of this title, and in relation to radiological, chemical, and biological warfare agents, high-level radioactive waste, and medical waste, for which no permit may be issued, the Administrator may issue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearings, for the transportation from the United States or, in the case of an agency or instrumentality of the United States, or in the case of a vessel or aircraft registered in the United States or flying the United States flag, for the transportation from a location outside the United States, of material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters, or for the dumping of material into the waters described in section 1411(b) of this title, where the Administrator determines that such dumping will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities. The Administrator shall establish and apply criteria for reviewing and evaluating such permit applications, and, in establishing or revising such criteria, shall consider, but not be limited in his consideration to, the following :</p>
<!-- PDFPage:476 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The need for the proposed dumping.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The effect of such dumping on human health and welfare, including economic, esthetic, and recreational values.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The effect of such dumping on fisheries resources, plankton, fish, shellfish, wildlife, shore lines and beaches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The effect of such dumping on marine ecosystems, particularly with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the transfer, concentration, and dispersion of such material and its byproducts through biological, physical, and chemical processes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) potential changes in marine ecosystem diversity, productivity, and stability, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) species and community population dynamics.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The persistence and permanence of the effects of the dumping.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The effect of dumping particular volumes and concentrations of such materials.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Appropriate locations and methods of disposal or recycling, including land-based alternatives and the probable impact of requiring use of such alternate locations or methods upon considerations affecting the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) The effect on alternate uses of oceans, such as scientific study, fishing, and other living resource exploitation, and non-living resource exploitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) In designating recommended sites, the Administrator shall utilize wherever feasible locations beyond the edge of the Continental Shelf.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In establishing or revising such criteria, the Administrator shall consult with Federal, State, and local officials, and interested members of the general public, as may appear appropriate to the Administrator. With respect to such criteria as may affect the civil works program of the Department of the Army, the Administrator shall also consult with the Secretary. In reviewing applications for permits, the Administrator shall make such provision for consultation with interested Federal and State agencies as he deems useful or necessary. No permit shall be issued for a dumping of material which will violate applicable water quality standards. To the extent that he may do so without relaxing the requirements of this subchapter, the Administrator, in establishing or revising such criteria, shall apply the standards and criteria binding upon the United States under the Convention, including its Annexes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Permit categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may establish and issue various categories of permits, including the general permits described in section 1414(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Designation of sites</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall, in a manner consistent with the criteria established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, designate sites or time periods for dumping. The Administrator shall designate sites or time periods for dumping that will mitigate adverse impact on the environment to the greatest extent practicable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibitions regarding site or time period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where the Administrator determines that, with respect to certain materials, it is necessary to prohibit dumping at a site or during a time period, the Administrator shall prohibit the dumping of such materials in such site or during such time period. This prohibition shall apply to any dumping at the site or during such time period. This prohibition shall apply to any dumping at the site or during the time period, including any dumping under section 1413(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Dredged material disposal sites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of dredged material disposal sites, the Administrator, in conjunction with the Secretary, shall develop a site management plan for each site designated pursuant to this section. In developing such plans, the Administrator and the Secretary shall provide opportunity for public comment. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a baseline assessment of conditions at the site;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a program for monitoring the site;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) special management conditions or practices to be implemented at each site that are necessary for protection of the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consideration of the quantity of the material to be disposed of at the site, and the presence, nature, and bioavailability of the contaminants in the material;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) consideration of the anticipated use of the site over the long term, including the anticipated closure date for the site, if applicable, and any need for management of the site after the closure of the site; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a schedule for review and revision of the plan (which shall not be reviewed and revised less frequently than 10 years after adoption of the plan, and every 10 years thereafter).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) General site management plan requirement; prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After January 1, 1995, no site shall receive a final designation unless a management plan has been developed pursuant to this section. Beginning on January 1, 1997, no permit for dumping pursuant to this Act or authorization for dumping under section 1413(e) of this title shall be issued for a site (other than the site located off the coast of Newport Beach, California, which is known as &ldquo;LA&ndash;3&rdquo;) unless such site has received a final designation pursuant to this subsection or an alternative site has been selected pursuant to section 1413(b) of this title. Beginning January 1, 2000, no permit for dumping pursuant to this Act or authorization for dumping under section 1413(e) of this title shall be issued for the site located off the coast of Newport Beach, California, which is known as &ldquo;LA&ndash;3&rdquo;, unless such site has received a final designation pursuant to this subsection or an alternative site has been selected pursuant to section 1413(b) of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:477 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Management plans for previously designated sites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall develop a site management plan for any site designated prior to January 1, 1995, as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than January 1, 1997, giving priority consideration to management plans for designated sites that are considered to have the greatest impact on the environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fish wastes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No permit is required under this subchapter for the transportation for dumping or the dumping of fish wastes, except when deposited in harbors or other protected or enclosed coastal waters, or where the Administrator finds that such deposits could endanger health, the environment, or ecological systems in a specific location. Where the Administrator makes such a finding, such material may be deposited only as authorized by a permit issued by the Administrator under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Foreign State permits; acceptance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of transportation of material, by an agency or instrumentality of the United States or by a vessel or aircraft registered in the United States or flying the United States flag, from a location in a foreign State Party to the Convention, a permit issued pursuant to the authority of that foreign State Party, in accordance with Convention requirements, and which otherwise could have been issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, shall be accepted, for the purposes of this subchapter, as if it were issued by the Administrator under the authority of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That in the case of an agency or instrumentality of the United States, no application shall be made for a permit to be issued pursuant to the authority of a foreign State Party to the Convention unless the Administrator concurs in the filing of such application.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Issuance by Secretary of the Army</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may issue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearings, for the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters, where the Secretary determines that the dumping will not unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Independent determination of need for dumping, other methods of disposal, and appropriate locations; alternative sites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making the determination required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall apply those criteria, established pursuant to section 1412(a) of this title, relating to the effects of the dumping. Based upon an evaluation of the potential effect of a permit denial on navigation, economic and industrial development, and foreign and domestic commerce of the United States, the Secretary shall make an independent determination as to the need for the dumping. The Secretary shall also make an independent determination as to other possible methods of disposal and as to appropriate locations for the dumping. In considering appropriate locations, he shall, to the maximum extent feasible, utilize the recommended sites designated by the Administrator pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title. In any case in which the use of a designated site is not feasible, the Secretary may, with the concurrence of the Administrator, select an alternative site. The criteria and factors established in section 1412(a) of this title relating to site selection shall be used in selecting the alternative site in a manner consistent with the application of such factors and criteria pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title. Disposal at or in the vicinity of an alternative site shall be limited to a period of not greater than 5 years unless the site is subsequently designated pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title; except that an alternative site may continue to be used for an additional period of time that shall not exceed 5 years if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no feasible disposal site has been designated by the Administrator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the continued use of the alternative site is necessary to maintain navigation and facilitate interstate or international commerce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Administrator determines that the continued use of the site does not pose an unacceptable risk to human health, aquatic resources, or the environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Concurrence by Administrator</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to issuing a permit to any person under this section, the Secretary shall first notify the Administrator of the Secretary's intention to do so and provide necessary and appropriate information concerning the permit to the Administrator. Within 30 days of receiving such information, the Administrator shall review the information and request any additional information the Administrator deems necessary to evaluate the proposed permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Concurrence by Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 45 days after receiving from the Secretary all information the Administrator considers to be necessary to evaluate the proposed permit, the Administrator shall, in writing, concur with (either entirely or with conditions) or decline to concur with the determination of the Secretary as to compliance with the criteria, conditions, and restrictions established pursuant to sections 1412(a) and 1412(c) of this title relating to the environmental impact of the permit. The Administrator may request one 45-day extension in writing and the Secretary shall grant such request on receipt of the request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of concurrence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where the Administrator makes a determination to concur (with or without conditions) or to decline to concur within the time period specified in paragraph (2) the determination shall prevail. If the Administrator declines to concur in the determination of the Secretary no permit shall be issued. If the Administrator concurs with conditions the permit shall include such conditions. The Administrator shall state in writing the reasons for declining to concur or for the conditions of the concurrence.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:479 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no written documentation is made by the Administrator within the time period provided for in paragraph (2), the Secretary may issue the permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Compliance with criteria and restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the Administrator grants a waiver pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, any permit issued by the Secretary shall require compliance with such criteria and restrictions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in any case, the Secretary finds that, in the disposition of dredged material, there is no economically feasible method or site available other than a dumping site the utilization of which would result in non-compliance with the criteria established pursuant to section 1412(a) of this title relating to the effects of dumping or with the restrictions established pursuant to section 1412(c) of this title relating to critical areas, he shall so certify and request a waiver from the Administrator of the specific requirements involved. Within thirty days of the receipt of the waiver request, unless the Administrator finds that the dumping of the material will result in an unacceptably adverse impact on municipal water supplies, shell-fish beds, wildlife, fisheries (including spawning and breeding areas), or recreational areas, he shall grant the waiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal projects involving dredged material</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with Federal projects involving dredged material, the Secretary may, in lieu of the permit procedure, issue regulations which will require the application to such projects of the same criteria, other factors to be evaluated, the same procedures, and the same requirements which apply to the issuance of permits under subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section and section 1414(a) and (d) of this title.</p>

No penalty shall be assessed until the person charged shall have been given notice and an opportunity for a hearing of such violation. In determining the amount of the penalty, the gravity of the violation, prior violations, and the demonstrated good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of a violation shall be considered by said Administrator. For good cause shown, the Administrator may remit or mitigate such penalty. Upon failure of the offending party to pay the penalty, the Administrator may request the Attorney General to commence an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for such relief as may be appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Injunctive relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General or his delegate may bring actions for equitable relief to enjoin an imminent or continuing violation of this subchapter, of regulations promulgated under this subchapter, or of permits issued under this subchapter, and the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to grant such relief as the equities of the case may require.</p>

The district courts shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such prohibition, limitation, criterion, or permit, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No action may be commenced&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prior to sixty days after notice of the violation has been given to the Administrator or to the Secretary, and to any alleged violator of the prohibition, limitation, criterion, or permit; or</p>
