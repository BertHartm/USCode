<h4 class="note-head">Sediments Decontamination Technology</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;580, title IV, &sect;405, Oct. 31, 1992, 106 Stat. 4863, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Decontamination Project.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Selection of technologies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Based upon a review of decontamination technologies identified pursuant to section 412(c) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 [Pub. L. 101&ndash;640, set out below], the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary shall, within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 31, 1992], jointly select removal, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and decontamination technologies for contaminated marine sediments for a decontamination project in the New York/New Jersey Harbor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Recommended program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon selection of technologies, the Administrator and the Secretary shall jointly recommend a program of selected technologies to assess their effectiveness in rendering sediments acceptable for unrestricted ocean disposal or beneficial reuse, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Decontamination Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, &lsquo;decontamination&rsquo; may include local or remote prototype or production and laboratory decontamination technologies, sediment pre-treatment and post-treatment processes, and siting, economic, or other measures necessary to develop a matrix for selection of interim prototype of long-term processes. Decontamination techniques need not be preproven in terms of likely success.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000 for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1992. Such sums shall remain available until expended.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Alternatives to Mud Dump Site for Disposal of Dredged Material</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 412 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;640 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 28, 1990], the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall submit to the Congress a final report on the feasibility of designating an alternative site to the Mud Dump Site at a distance not less than 20 miles from the shoreline.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 28, 1990], the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall submit to Congress a plan for the long-term management of dredged material from the New York/New Jersey Harbor region. The plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) an identification of the source, quantities, and characteristics of material to be dredged;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a discussion of potential alternative sites for disposal of dredged material, including the feasibility of altering the boundaries of the Mud Dump Site;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) measures to reduce the quantities of dredged material proposed for ocean disposal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) measures to reduce the amount of contaminants in materials proposed to be dredged from the Harbor through source controls and decontamination technology;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) a program for monitoring the physical, chemical, and biological effects of dumping dredged material at the Mud Dump Site; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a study of the characteristics of the bottom sediments, including type and distribution.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Demonstration Project</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall implement a demonstration project for disposing on an annual basis up to 10 percent of the material dredged from the New York/New Jersey Harbor region in an environmentally sound manner other than by ocean disposal. Environmentally sound alternatives may include, among others, capping of borrow pits, construction of a containment island, application for landfill cover, habitat restoration, and use of decontamination technology.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Mud Dump Site Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, the term &lsquo;Mud Dump Site&rsquo; means the area located approximately 53/4 miles east of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, with boundary coordinates of 40 degrees, 23 minutes, 48 seconds North, 73 degrees, 51 minutes, 28 seconds West; 40 degrees, 21 minutes, 48 seconds North, 73 degrees, 50 minutes, 00 seconds West; 40 degrees, 21 minutes, 48 seconds North; 73 degrees, 51 minutes, 28 seconds West; and 40 degrees, 23 minutes, 48 seconds North; 73 degrees, 50 minutes, 00 seconds West.</p>
