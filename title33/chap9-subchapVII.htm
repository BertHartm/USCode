<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage the establishment and maintenance of effective programs intended to assure dam safety to protect human life and property and to improve such existing programs, the Secretary shall provide assistance under the terms of section 467f of this title to any State that establishes and maintains a dam safety program which is approved under this section. In evaluating a State's dam safety program, under the terms of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Secretary shall determine that such program includes the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a procedure, whereby, prior to any construction the plans for any dam will be reviewed to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and integrity of such dam over its intended life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a procedure to determine, during and following construction and prior to operation of each dam built in the State, that such dam has been constructed and will be operated in a safe and reasonable manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a procedure to inspect every dam within such State at least once every five years, except that such inspections shall be required at least every three years for any dam the failure of which is likely to result in the loss of human life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a procedure for more detailed and frequent safety inspections, when warranted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the State has or can be expected to have authority to require those changes or modifications in a dam, or its operation, necessary to assure the dam's safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the State has or can be expected to develop a system of emergency procedures that would be utilized in the event a dam fails or in the event a dam's failure is imminent together with an identification of those dams where failure could be reasonably expected to endanger human life, and of the maximum area that could be inundated in the event of the failure of such dam, as well as identification of those necessary public facilities that would be affected by such inundation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the State has or can be expected to have the authority to assure that any repairs or other changes needed to maintain the integ<!-- PDFPage:72 -->rity of any dam will be undertaken by the dam's owner, or other responsible party; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the State has or can be expected to have authority and necessary emergency funds to assure immediate repairs or other changes to, or removal of, a dam in order to protect human life and property, and if the owner does not take action, to take appropriate action as expeditiously as possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any program which is submitted to the Secretary under the authority of this section shall be deemed approved 120 days following its receipt by the Secretary unless the Secretary determines within such 120-day period that such program fails to reasonably meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section. If the Secretary determines such a program cannot be approved, he shall immediately notify such State in writing, together with his reasons and those changes needed to enable such plan to be approved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Periodic review; revocation of approval; reapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Utilizing the expertise of the Board established under section 467h of this title, the Secretary shall review periodically the implementation and effectiveness of approved State dam safety programs. In the event the Board finds that a State program under this subchapter has proven inadequate to reasonably protect human life and property, and the Secretary agrees, the Secretary shall revoke approval of such State program and withhold assistance under the terms of section 467f of this title until such State program has been reapproved.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) After November 17, 1986, costs incurred in the modification by the Secretary of dams and related facilities constructed or operated by the Secretary, the cause of which results from new hydrologic or seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art design or construction criteria deemed necessary for safety purposes, shall be recovered in accordance with the provisions in this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fifteen percent of the modification costs shall be assigned to project purposes in accordance with the cost allocation in effect for the project at the time the work is initiated. Non-Federal interests shall share the costs assigned to each purpose in accord with the cost sharing in effect at the time of initial project construction: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary of the Interior shall recover costs assigned to irrigation in accordance with repayment provisions of Public Law 98&ndash;404.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Repayment under this subsection, with the exception of costs assigned to irrigation, may be made, with interest, over a period of not more than thirty years from the date of completion of the work. The interest rate used shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the applicable reimbursable period during the month preceding the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred, plus a premium of one-eighth of one percentage point for transaction costs. To the extent that more than one interest rate is determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an interest rate at the weighted average of the rates so determined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Nothing in this section affects the authority of the Secretary to perform work pursuant to Public Law 84&ndash;99, as amended (33 U.S.C. 701n) or cost sharing for such work.</p>
