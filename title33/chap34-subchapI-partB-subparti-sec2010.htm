<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) so far as practicable keep clear of a traffic separation line or separation zone;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) normally join or leave a traffic lane at the termination of the lane, but when joining or leaving from either side shall do so at as small an angle to the general direction of traffic flow as practicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Crossing traffic lanes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes but if obliged to do so shall cross on a heading as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of inshore traffic lane</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A vessel shall not use an inshore traffic zone when she can safely use the appropriate traffic lane within the adjacent traffic separation scheme. However, vessels of less than twenty meters in length, sailing vessels, and vessels engaged in fishing may use the inshore traffic zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (d)(i), a vessel may use an inshore traffic zone when en route to or from a port, offshore installation or structure, pilot station, or any other place situated within the inshore traffic zone, or to avoid immediate danger.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Entering separation zone or crossing separation line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel other than a crossing vessel or a vessel joining or leaving a lane shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Avoidance of scheme</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel not using a traffic separation scheme shall avoid it by as wide a margin as is practicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Fishing vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Power-driven vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel of less than twenty meters in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the safe passage of a power-driven vessel following a traffic lane.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Exemption; maintenance of safety of navigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver when engaged in an operation for the maintenance of safety of navigation in a traffic separation scheme is exempted from complying with this Rule to the extent necessary to carry out the operation.</p>
