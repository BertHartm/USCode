This effort will include the study of a verified, nested, high-resolution Harbor/Bight Apex numerical model, and supportive monitoring and information systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Hydraulic Model</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition, the Secretary shall study a proper physical hydraulic model of the New York Bight and the tying in of such model to the existing inshore physical hydraulic model of the Port of New York and New Jersey operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This New York Bight and Harbor effort will address the engineering, environmental, and social impacts of natural and man-made changes to the New York Bight, including water quality parameters such as contaminant and sediment transport effects, and nutrient eutrophication.</p>

The study and report are not intended to encumber civil works projects under development or scheduled to be maintained. Work on these projects shall proceed along the present schedule.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 31, 1992], the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate, the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives, and to the State of New Jersey a report on&mdash;</p>
