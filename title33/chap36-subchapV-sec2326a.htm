<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cost recovery authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal interest may recover the costs assigned to the additional capacity through fees assessed on third parties whose dredged material is deposited at the facility and who enter into agreements with the non-Federal interest for the use of the facility.

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A partnership agreement under this subsection may allow the non-Federal interest to receive reimbursable payments from the Federal Government for commitments made by the non-Federal interest for disposal or placement capacity at dredged material processing, treatment, contaminant reduction, or disposal facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A partnership agreement under this subsection may allow costs incurred by the non-Federal interest before execution of the partnership agreement to be credited in accordance with section 1962d&ndash;5b of title 42.</p>
