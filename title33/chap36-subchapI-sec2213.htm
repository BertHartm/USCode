<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal interests for a project with costs assigned to flood control (other than a nonstructural project) shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 25 percent minimum contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value of the contributions required under paragraph (1) of this subsection is less than 25 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control, the non-Federal interest shall pay during construction of the project such additional amounts as are necessary so that the total contribution of the non-Federal interests under this subsection is equal to 25 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) 50 percent maximum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal share under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control. The preceding sentence does not modify the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Deferred payment of amount exceeding 30 percent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the total amount of the contribution required under paragraph (1) of this subsection exceeds 30 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control, the non-Federal interests may pay the amount of the excess to the Secretary over a 15-year period (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Secretary and the non-Federal interests) beginning on the date construction of the project or separable element is completed, at an interest rate determined pursuant to section 2216 of this title. The preceding sentence does not modify the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nonstructural flood control projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The non-Federal share of the cost of nonstructural flood control measures shall be 25 percent of the cost of such measures. The non-Federal interests for any such measures shall be required to provide all lands, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations necessary for the project, but shall not be required to contribute any amount in cash during construction of the project.</p>
