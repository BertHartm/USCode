<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 35 percent minimum contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value of the contributions required under paragraph (1) of this subsection is less than 35 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control, the non-Federal interest shall pay during construction of the project such additional amounts as are necessary so that the total contribution of the non-Federal interests under this subsection is equal to 35 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) 50 percent maximum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal share under paragraph (1) shall not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the project assigned to flood control. The preceding sentence does not modify the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:595 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Deferred payment of amount exceeding 30 percent</h4>

The preceding sentence does not modify the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nonstructural flood control projects</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal share of the cost of nonstructural flood control measures shall be 35 percent of the cost of such measures.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Non-Federal contribution in excess of 35 percent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time during construction of a project, if the Secretary determines that the costs of land, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, and relocations for the project, in combination with other costs contributed by the non-Federal interests, will exceed 35 percent, any additional costs for the project (not to exceed 65 percent of the total costs of the project) shall be a Federal responsibility and shall be contributed during construction as part of the Federal share.</p>
