<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Opinions of Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission; defense to judicial proceedings, license inadmissible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not issue any license pursuant to section 1503 of this title unless he has received the opinions of the Attorney General of the United States and the Federal Trade Commission as to whether such action would adversely affect competition, restrain trade, promote monopolization, or otherwise create a situation in contravention of the antitrust laws. The issuance of a license under this chapter shall not be admissible in any way as a defense <!-- PDFPage:486 -->to any civil or criminal action for violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, nor shall it in any way modify or abridge any private right of action under such laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications; submittal to Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission for preparation of reports to Secretary of Transportation; antitrust laws unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall transmit promptly to the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission a complete copy of each application for issuance of a license or a petition for the amendment, transfer, or reinstatement of a license that is received. Within 45 days following the last public hearing on license application, the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission shall each prepare and submit to the Secretary a report assessing the competitive effects which may result from issuance of the proposed license and the opinions described in subsection (a) of this section. If either the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission, or both, fails to file such views within such period, the Secretary shall proceed as if he had received such views.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to bar the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission from challenging any anticompetitive situation involved in the ownership, construction, or operation of a deepwater port.</p>
