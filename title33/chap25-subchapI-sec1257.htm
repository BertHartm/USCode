Such projects shall demonstrate the engineering and economic feasibility and practicality of various abatement techniques which will contribute substantially to effective and practical methods of acid or other mine water pollution elimination or control, and other pollution affecting water quality, including techniques that demonstrate the engineering and economic feasibility and practicality of using sewage sludge materials and other municipal wastes to diminish or prevent pollution affecting water quality from acid, sedimentation, or other pollutants and in such projects to restore affected lands to usefulness for forestry, agriculture, recreation, or other beneficial purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consistency of projects with objectives of Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions upon Federal participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Federal participation in such projects shall be subject to the conditions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the State shall acquire any land or interests therein necessary for such project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the State shall provide legal and practical protection to the project area to insure against any activities which will cause future acid or other mine water pollution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated $30,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this section, which sum shall be available until expended.</p>
