<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall pay an additional 10 percent of the cost of the general navigation features of the project in cash over a period not to exceed 30 years, at an interest rate determined pursuant to section 2216 of this title. The value of lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations provided under paragraph (3) and the costs of relocations borne by the non-Federal interests under paragraph (4) shall be credited toward the payment required under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Lands, easements, and rights-of-way</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided under section 2283(c) of this title, the non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall provide the lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations (other than utility relocations under paragraph (4)) necessary for the project, including any lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations (other than utility relocations accomplished under paragraph (4)) that are necessary for dredged material disposal facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Utility relocations</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dredged material disposal facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal share of the cost of constructing land-based and aquatic dredged material disposal facilities that are necessary for the disposal of dredged material required for the operation and maintenance of a project and for which a contract for construction has not been awarded on or before October 12, 1996, shall be determined in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The Federal share of operating and maintaining such facilities shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Erosion or shoaling attributable to Federal navigation works</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Costs of constructing projects or measures for the prevention or mitigation of erosion or shoaling damages attributable to Federal navigation works shall be shared in the same proportion as the cost sharing provisions applicable to the project causing such erosion or shoaling. The non-Federal interests for the project causing the erosion or shoaling shall agree to operate and maintain such measures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Non-Federal payments during construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any non-Federal share of the cost of any navigation project for a harbor or inland harbor shall be paid to the Secretary. Amounts required to be paid during construction shall be paid on an annual basis during the period of construction, beginning not later than one year after construction is initiated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Agreement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide to the Federal Government the non-Federal share of all other costs of construction of such project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a deep-draft harbor, be responsible for the non-Federal share of operation and maintenance required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consideration of funding requirements and equitable apportionment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funding requirements for operation and maintenance dredging of commercial navigation harbors are considered before Federal funds are obligated for payment of the Federal share of costs associated with the construction of dredged material disposal facilities in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) funds expended for such construction are apportioned equitably in accordance with regional needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) use of a dredged material disposal facility designed, constructed, managed, or operated by a private entity is not precluded if, consistent with economic and environmental considerations, the facility is the least-cost alternative.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2283. Fish and wildlife mitigation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Steps to be taken prior to or concurrently with construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any water resources project which is authorized to be constructed by the Secretary before, on, or after November 17, 1986, construction of which has not commenced as of November 17, 1986, and which necessitates the mitigation of fish and wildlife losses, including the acquisition of lands or interests in lands to mitigate losses to fish and wildlife, as a result of such project, such mitigation, including acquisition of the lands or interests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be undertaken or acquired before any construction of the project (other than such acquisition) commences, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be undertaken or acquired concurrently with lands and interests in lands for project purposes (other than mitigation of fish and wildlife losses),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever the Secretary determines is appropriate, except that any physical construction required for the purposes of mitigation may be undertaken concurrently with the physical construction of such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection, any project authorized before November 17, 1986, on which more than 50 percent of the land needed for the project, exclusive of mitigation lands, has been acquired shall be deemed to have commenced construction under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acquisition of lands or interests in lands for mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After consultation with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies, the Secretary is authorized to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife resulting from any water resources project under his jurisdiction, whether completed, under construction, or to be constructed. Such mitigation may include the acquisition of lands, or interests therein, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquisition under this paragraph shall not be by condemnation in the case of projects completed as of November 17, 1986, or on which at least 10 percent of the physical construction on the project has been completed as of November 17, 1986; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquisition of water, or interests therein, under this paragraph, shall not be by condemnation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary, shall, under the terms of this paragraph, obligate no more than $30,000,000 in any fiscal year. With respect to any water resources project, the authority under this subsection shall not apply to measures that cost more than $7,500,000 or 10 percent of the cost of the project, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever, after his review, the Secretary determines that such mitigation features under this subsection are likely to require condemnation under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report on such proposed modification, together with his recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of mitigation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Costs incurred after November 17, 1986, including lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations, for implementation and operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife shall be allocated among authorized project purposes in accordance with applicable cost allocation procedures, and shall be subject to cost sharing or reimbursement to the same extent as such other project costs are shared or reimbursed, except that when such costs are covered by contracts entered into prior to November 17, 1986, such costs shall not be recovered without the consent of the non-Federal interests or until such contracts are complied with or renegotiated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mitigation plans as part of project proposals</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After November 17, 1986, the Secretary shall not submit any proposal for the authorization of any water resources project to the Congress unless such report contains (A) a recommendation with a specific plan to mitigate fish and wildlife losses created by such project, or (B) a determination by the Secretary that such project will have negligible adverse impact on fish and wildlife. Specific mitigation plans shall ensure that impacts to bottomland hardwood forests are mitigated in-kind, to the ex<!-- PDFPage:608 -->tent possible. In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Design of mitigation projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall design mitigation projects to reflect contemporary understanding of the science of mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of water resources projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) First enhancement costs as Federal costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In those cases when the Secretary, as part of any report to Congress, recommends activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources, the first costs of such enhancement shall be a Federal cost when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such enhancement provides benefits that are determined to be national, including benefits to species that are identified by the National Marine Fisheries Service as of national economic importance, species that are subject to treaties or international convention to which the United States is a party, and anadromous fish;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such enhancement is designed to benefit species that have been listed as threatened or endangered by the Secretary of the Interior under the terms of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such activities are located on lands managed as a national wildlife refuge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">When benefits of enhancement do not qualify under the preceding sentence, 25 percent of such first costs of enhancement shall be provided by non-Federal interests under a schedule of reimbursement determined by the Secretary. Not more than 80 percent of the non-Federal share of such first costs may be satisfied through in-kind contributions, including facilities, supplies, and services that are necessary to carry out the enhancement project. The non-Federal share of operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources shall be 25 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National benefits from enhancement measures for Atchafalaya Floodway System and Mississippi Delta Region projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Fish and wildlife enhancement measures carried out as part of the project for Atchafalaya Floodway System, Louisiana, authorized by Public Law 99&ndash;88, and the project for Mississippi Delta Region, Louisiana, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1965, shall be considered to provide benefits that are national for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act supplementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (d) of this section shall be deemed to supplement the responsibility and authority of the Secretary pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act [16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], and nothing in this section is intended to affect that Act.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary may enter into an agreement with a non-Federal interest with respect to a project, a private entity, or both for the acquisition, design, construction, management, or operation of a dredged material disposal facility (including any facility used to demonstrate potential beneficial uses of dredged material) using funds provided in whole or in part by the private entity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any funds provided by a private entity are used to carry out a project under this subsection, the Secretary may reimburse the private entity over a period of time agreed to by the parties to the agreement through the payment of subsequent user fees. Such fees may include the payment of a disposal or tipping fee for placement of suitable dredged material at the facility.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Amount of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">User fees paid pursuant to subparagraph (B) shall be sufficient to repay funds contributed by the private entity plus a reasonable return on investment approved by the Secretary in cooperation with the non-Federal interest with respect to the project and the private entity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Federal share of such fees shall be equal to the percentage of the total cost that would otherwise be borne by the Federal Government as required pursuant to existing cost-sharing requirements, including section 2213 of this title and section 2326 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Budget Act compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any spending authority (as defined in section 651(c)(2) of title 2) authorized by this section shall be effective only to such extent and in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts.</p>
