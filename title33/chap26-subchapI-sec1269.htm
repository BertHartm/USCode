<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Long Island Sound is a national treasure of great cultural, environmental, and ecological importance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) 8,000,000 people live within the Long Island Sound watershed and 28,000,000 people (approximately 10 percent of the population of the United States) live within 50 miles of Long Island Sound;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) activities that depend on the environmental health of Long Island Sound contribute more than $5,000,000,000 each year to the regional economy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the portion of the shoreline of Long Island Sound that is accessible to the general public (estimated at less than 20 percent of the total shoreline) is not adequate to serve the needs of the people living in the area;</p>
