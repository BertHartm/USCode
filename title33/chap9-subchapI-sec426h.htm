<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of erosion control program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish and conduct a national shoreline erosion control development and demonstration program for a period of 6 years beginning on the date that funds are made available to carry out this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The erosion control program shall include provisions for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) projects consisting of planning, designing, and constructing prototype engineered and vegetative shoreline erosion control devices and methods during the first 3 years of the erosion control program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adequate monitoring of the prototypes throughout the duration of the erosion control program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) detailed engineering and environmental reports on the results of each demonstration project carried out under the erosion control program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) technology transfers to private property owners and State and local entities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Emphasis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The projects carried out under the erosion control program shall emphasize, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the development and demonstration of innovative technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) efficient designs to prevent erosion at a shoreline site, taking into account the life-cycle cost of the design, including cleanup, maintenance, and amortization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) natural designs, including the use of vegetation or temporary structures that minimize permanent structural alterations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the avoidance of negative impacts to adjacent shorefront communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in areas with substantial residential or commercial interests adjacent to the shoreline, designs that do not impair the aesthetic appeal of the interests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the potential for long-term protection afforded by the technology; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) recommendations developed from evaluations of the original 1974 program established under the Shoreline Erosion Control Demonstration Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1962d&ndash;5 note; 88 Stat. 26), including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) adequate consideration of the subgrade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) proper filtration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) durable components;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) adequate connection between units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) consideration of additional relevant information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sites</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each project under the erosion control program shall be carried out at a privately owned site with substantial public access, or a publicly owned site, on open coast or on tidal waters.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Selection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop criteria for the selection of sites for the projects, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a variety of geographical and climatic conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the size of the population that is dependent on the beaches for recreation, protection of homes, or commercial interests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the rate of erosion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) significant natural resources or habitats and environmentally sensitive areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) significant threatened historic structures or landmarks.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Projects under the erosion control program shall be carried out at not fewer than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 2 sites on each of the shorelines of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, including the city of Miami Beach, Florida;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 2 sites on the shoreline of the Great Lakes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) 1 site on the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination of feasibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Implementation of a project under this section is contingent upon a determination by the Secretary that such project is feasible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall carry out the erosion control program in consultation with&mdash;</p>
