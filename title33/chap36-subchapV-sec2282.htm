<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Report authority; contents; views of other agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any water resources project-related study authorized to be undertaken by the Secretary, the Secretary shall prepare a feasibility report, subject to section 2215 of this title. Such feasibility report shall describe, with reasonable certainty, the economic, environmental, and social benefits and detriments of the recommended plan and alternative plans considered by the Secretary and the engineering features (including hydrologic and geologic information), the public acceptability, and the purposes, scope, and scale of the recommended plan. The feasibility report shall also include the views of other Federal agencies and non-Federal agencies with regard to the recommended plan, a description of a nonstructural alternative to the recommended plan when such plan does not have significant nonstructural features, and a description of the Federal and non-Federal participation in such plan, and shall demonstrate that States, other non-Federal interests, and Federal agencies have been consulted in the development of the recommended plan. This subsection shall not apply to (1) any study with respect to which a report has been submitted to Congress before November 17, 1986, (2) any study for a project, which project is authorized for construction by this Act and is not subject to section 903(b), (3) any study for a project which is authorized under any of the following sections: section 205 of the Flood Control Act of 1948 (33 U.S.C. 701s), section 2 of the Flood Control Act of August 28, 1946 (33 U.S.C. 701r),<sup><a href="#2282_1_target" name="2282_1">1</a></sup> section 107 of the River and Harbor Act of 1960 (33 U.S.C. 577), section 3 of the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act authorizing Federal participation in the cost of protecting the shores of publicly owned property&rdquo;, approved August 13, 1946 (33 U.S.C. 426g), and section 111 of the River and Harbor Act of 1968 (33 U.S.C. 426i), and (4) general studies not intended to lead to recommendation of a specific water resources project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reconnaissance studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before initiating any feasibility study under subsection (a) of this section after November 17, 1986, the Secretary shall first perform, at Federal expense, a reconnaissance study of the water resources problem in order to identify potential solutions to such problem in sufficient detail to enable the Secretary to determine whether or not planning to develop a project should proceed to the preparation of a feasibility report. Such reconnaissance study shall include a preliminary analysis of the Federal interest, costs, benefits, and environmental impacts of such project, and an estimate of the costs of preparing the feasibility report. The duration of a reconnaissance study shall normally be no more than twelve months, but in all cases is to be limited to eighteen months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Benefits to Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of studies undertaken pursuant to this section, the Secretary is authorized to consider benefits which may accrue to Indian tribes as a result of a project resulting from such a study.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of standard and uniform procedures and practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall undertake such measures as are necessary to ensure that standard and uniform procedures and practices are followed by each district office (and each division office for any area in which there is no district office) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the preparation of feasibility reports on water resources projects.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">References in Text</h4>
<p class="note-body">This Act, referred to in subsec. (a), is Pub. L. 99&ndash;662, Nov. 17, 1986, 100 Stat. 4082, as amended, known as the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 2201 of this title and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 903(b), referred to in subsec. (a), is section 903(b) of Pub. L. 99&ndash;662, title IX, Nov. 17, 1986, 100 Stat. 4184, which is not classified to the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of the Flood Control Act of August 28, 1946 (33 U.S.C. 701r), referred to in subsec. (a), probably should be a reference to &ldquo;section 2 of the Flood Control Act of August 28, 1937 (33 U.S.C. 701g), section 14 of the Flood Control Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 701r)&rdquo;, as the probable intent of Congress. Such latter reference appears in an earlier version of H.R. 6 which became Pub. L. 99&ndash;662, and also appears in section 915(h) of Pub. L. 99&ndash;662, which is classified to section 2290(h) of this title.</p>
