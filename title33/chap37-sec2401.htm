<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Antifouling paints containing organotin biocides are used to prevent the build-up of barnacles and other encrusting organisms on vessels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Laboratory and field studies show that organotin is very toxic to marine and freshwater organisms at very low levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Vessels that are less than 25 meters in length and are coated with organotin antifouling paint account for a large amount of the organotin released into the aquatic environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that concentrations of organotin currently in the waters of the United States may pose unreasonable risks to oysters, clams, fish, and other aquatic life.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this chapter is to protect the aquatic environment by reducing immediately the quantities of organotin entering the waters of the United States.</p>
