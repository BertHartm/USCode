<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established an estuary habitat restoration program under which the Secretary may carry out estuary habitat restoration projects and provide technical assistance in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Origin of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proposed estuary habitat restoration project shall originate from a non-Federal interest consistent with State or local laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Selection of projects</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall select estuary habitat restoration projects from a list of project proposals submitted by the Estuary Habitat Restoration Council under section 2904(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Required elements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each estuary habitat restoration project selected by the Secretary must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) address restoration needs identified in an estuary habitat restoration plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be consistent with the estuary habitat restoration strategy developed under section 2905 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) include a monitoring plan that is consistent with standards for monitoring developed under section 2906 of this title to ensure that short-term and long-term restoration goals are achieved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) include satisfactory assurance from the non-Federal interests proposing the project that the non-Federal interests will have adequate personnel, funding, and authority to carry out items of local cooperation and properly maintain the project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors for selection of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In selecting an estuary habitat restoration project, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:689 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Whether the project is part of an approved Federal estuary management or habitat restoration plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The technical feasibility of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The scientific merit of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Whether the project will encourage increased coordination and cooperation among Federal, State, and local government agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Whether the project fosters public-private partnerships and uses Federal resources to encourage increased private sector involvement, including consideration of the amount of private funds or in-kind contributions for an estuary habitat restoration activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Whether the project is cost-effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Whether the State in which the non-Federal interest is proposing the project has a dedicated source of funding to acquire or restore estuary habitat, natural areas, and open spaces for the benefit of estuary habitat restoration or protection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Other factors that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and necessary for consideration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In selecting estuary habitat restoration projects to be carried out under this chapter, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to a project if, in addition to meriting selection based on the factors under paragraph (3)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the project occurs within a watershed in which there is a program being carried out that addresses sources of pollution and other activities that otherwise would re-impair the restored habitat; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the project includes pilot testing of or a demonstration of an innovative technology having the potential for improved cost-effectiveness in estuary habitat restoration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cost sharing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (e)(2) of this section, the Federal share of the cost of an estuary habitat restoration project (other than the cost of operation and maintenance of the project) carried out under this chapter shall not exceed 65 percent of such cost.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Innovative technology costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal share of the incremental additional cost of including in a project pilot testing of or a demonstration of an innovative technology described in subsection (c)(4)(B) of this section shall be 85 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal share of the cost of an estuary habitat restoration project carried out under this chapter shall include lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations and may include services, or any other form of in-kind contribution determined by the Secretary to be an appropriate contribution equivalent to the monetary amount required for the non-Federal share of the activity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Operation and maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal interests shall be responsible for all costs associated with operating, maintaining, replacing, repairing, and rehabilitating all projects carried out under this section.</p>
