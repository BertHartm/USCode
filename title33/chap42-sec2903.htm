<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established an estuary habitat restoration program under which the Secretary may carry out estuary habitat restoration <!-- PDFPage:702 -->projects and provide technical assistance through the award of contracts and cooperative agreements in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Origin of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proposed estuary habitat restoration project shall originate from a non-Federal interest consistent with State or local laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Selection of projects</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall select estuary habitat restoration projects from a list of project proposals submitted by the Estuary Habitat Restoration Council under section 2904(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors for selection of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In selecting an estuary habitat restoration project, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Whether the project is part of an approved Federal or State estuary management or habitat restoration plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The technical feasibility of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The scientific merit of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Whether the project will encourage increased coordination and cooperation among Federal, State, and local government agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Whether the project fosters public-private partnerships and uses Federal resources to encourage increased private sector involvement, including consideration of the amount of private funds or in-kind contributions for an estuary habitat restoration activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Whether the project is cost-effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Whether the State in which the non-Federal interest is proposing the project has a dedicated source of funding to acquire or restore estuary habitat, natural areas, and open spaces for the benefit of estuary habitat restoration or protection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Other factors that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and necessary for consideration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In selecting estuary habitat restoration projects to be carried out under this chapter, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to a project if, in addition to meriting selection based on the factors under paragraph (3)&mdash;</p>
