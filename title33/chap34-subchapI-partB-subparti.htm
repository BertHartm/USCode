<p class="statutory-body">(a) By all vessels:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) the draft in relation to the available depth of water.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General characteristics of action taken to avoid collision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any action taken to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Readily apparent alterations in course or speed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alteration of course or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course or speed should be avoided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alteration of course to avoid close-quarters situation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Action to result in passing at safe distance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Slackening of vessel speed; stopping or reversing means of propulsion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Early action to allow room for safe passage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the other vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A vessel required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the Rules of this part when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on her starboard side as is safe and practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(i) and Rule 14(a), a power-driven vessel operating in narrow channels or fairways on the Great Lakes, Western Rivers, or waters specified by the Secretary, and proceeding downbound with a following current shall have the right-of-way over an upbound vessel, shall propose the manner and place of passage, and shall initiate the maneuvering signals prescribed by Rule 34(a)(i), as appropriate. The vessel proceeding upbound against the current shall hold as necessary to permit safe passing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Vessels of less than 20 meters in length; sailing vessels</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Overtaking vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking, the power-driven vessel intending to overtake another power-driven vessel shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c) and take steps to permit safe passing.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Crossing traffic lanes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes but if obliged to do so shall cross on a heading as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of inshore traffic lane</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A vessel shall not use an inshore traffic zone when she can safely use the appropriate traffic lane within the adjacent traffic separation scheme. However, vessels of less than twenty meters in length, sailing vessels, and vessels engaged in fishing may use the inshore traffic zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (d)(i), a vessel may use an inshore traffic zone when en route to or from a port, offshore installation or structure, pilot station, or any other place situated within the inshore traffic zone, or to avoid immediate danger.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Entering separation zone or crossing separation line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel other than a crossing vessel or a vessel joining or leaving a lane shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except:</p>
