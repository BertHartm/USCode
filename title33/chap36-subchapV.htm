<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Report authority; contents; views of other agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any water resources project-related study authorized to be undertaken by the Secretary, the Secretary shall prepare a feasibility report, subject to section 2215 of this title. Such feasibility report shall describe, with reasonable certainty, the economic, environmental, and social benefits and detriments of the recommended plan and alternative plans considered by the Secretary and the engineering features (including hydrologic and geologic information), the public acceptability, and the purposes, scope, and scale of the recommended plan. The feasibility report shall also include the views of other Federal agencies and non-Federal agencies with regard to the recommended plan, a description of a nonstructural alternative to the recommended plan when such plan does not have significant nonstructural features, and a description of the Federal and non-Federal participation in such plan, and shall demonstrate that States, other non-Federal interests, and Federal agencies have been consulted in the development of the recommended plan. This subsection shall not apply to (1) any study with respect to which a report has been submitted to Congress before November 17, 1986, (2) any study for a project, which project is authorized for construction by this Act and is not subject to section 903(b), (3) any study for a project which is authorized under any of the following sections: section 205 of the Flood Control Act of 1948 (33 U.S.C. 701s), section 2 of the Flood Control Act of August 28, 1946 (33 U.S.C. 701r),<sup><a href="#2282_1_target" name="2282_1">1</a></sup> section 107 of the River and Harbor Act of 1960 (33 U.S.C. 577), section 3 of the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act authorizing Federal participation in the cost of protecting the shores of publicly owned property&rdquo;, approved August 13, 1946 (33 U.S.C. 426g), and section 111 of the River and Harbor Act of 1968 (33 U.S.C. 426i), and (4) general studies not intended to lead to recommendation of a specific water resources project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reconnaissance studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before initiating any feasibility study under subsection (a) of this section after November 17, 1986, the Secretary shall first perform, at Federal expense, a reconnaissance study of the water resources problem in order to identify potential solutions to such problem in sufficient detail to enable the Secretary to determine whether or not planning to develop a project should proceed to the preparation of a feasibility report. Such reconnaissance study shall include a preliminary analysis of the Federal interest, costs, benefits, and environmental impacts of such project, and an estimate of the costs of preparing the feasibility report. The duration of a reconnaissance study shall normally be no more than twelve months, but in all cases is to be limited to eighteen months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Benefits to Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of studies undertaken pursuant to this section, the Secretary is authorized to consider benefits which may accrue to Indian tribes as a result of a project resulting from such a study.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of standard and uniform procedures and practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall undertake such measures as are necessary to ensure that standard and uniform procedures and practices are followed by each district office (and each division office for any area in which there is no district office) of the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the preparation of feasibility reports on water resources projects.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2283. Fish and wildlife mitigation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Steps to be taken prior to or concurrently with construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any water resources project which is authorized to be constructed by the Secretary before, on, or after November 17, 1986, construction of which has not commenced as of <!-- PDFPage:578 -->November 17, 1986, and which necessitates the mitigation of fish and wildlife losses, including the acquisition of lands or interests in lands to mitigate losses to fish and wildlife, as a result of such project, such mitigation, including acquisition of the lands or interests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be undertaken or acquired before any construction of the project (other than such acquisition) commences, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be undertaken or acquired concurrently with lands and interests in lands for project purposes (other than mitigation of fish and wildlife losses),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever the Secretary determines is appropriate, except that any physical construction required for the purposes of mitigation may be undertaken concurrently with the physical construction of such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection, any project authorized before November 17, 1986, on which more than 50 percent of the land needed for the project, exclusive of mitigation lands, has been acquired shall be deemed to have commenced construction under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acquisition of lands or interests in lands for mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After consultation with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies, the Secretary is authorized to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife resulting from any water resources project under his jurisdiction, whether completed, under construction, or to be constructed. Such mitigation may include the acquisition of lands, or interests therein, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquisition under this paragraph shall not be by condemnation in the case of projects completed as of November 17, 1986, or on which at least 10 percent of the physical construction on the project has been completed as of November 17, 1986; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquisition of water, or interests therein, under this paragraph, shall not be by condemnation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary, shall, under the terms of this paragraph, obligate no more than $30,000,000 in any fiscal year. With respect to any water resources project, the authority under this subsection shall not apply to measures that cost more than $7,500,000 or 10 percent of the cost of the project, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever, after his review, the Secretary determines that such mitigation features under this subsection are likely to require condemnation under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report on such proposed modification, together with his recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of mitigation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Costs incurred after November 17, 1986, including lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations, for implementation and operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife shall be allocated among authorized project purposes in accordance with applicable cost allocation procedures, and shall be subject to cost sharing or reimbursement to the same extent as such other project costs are shared or reimbursed, except that when such costs are covered by contracts entered into prior to November 17, 1986, such costs shall not be recovered without the consent of the non-Federal interests or until such contracts are complied with or renegotiated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mitigation plans as part of project proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After November 17, 1986, the Secretary shall not submit any proposal for the authorization of any water resources project to the Congress unless such report contains (1) a recommendation with a specific plan to mitigate fish and wildlife losses created by such project, or (2) a determination by the Secretary that such project will have negligible adverse impact on fish and wildlife. Specific mitigation plans shall ensure that impacts to bottomland hardwood forests are mitigated in-kind, to the extent possible. In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) First enhancement costs as Federal costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In those cases when the Secretary, as part of any report to Congress, recommends activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources, the first costs of such enhancement shall be a Federal cost when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such enhancement provides benefits that are determined to be national, including benefits to species that are identified by the National Marine Fisheries Service as of national economic importance, species that are subject to treaties or international convention to which the United States is a party, and anadromous fish;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such enhancement is designed to benefit species that have been listed as threatened or endangered by the Secretary of the Interior under the terms of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such activities are located on lands managed as a national wildlife refuge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">When benefits of enhancement do not qualify under the preceding sentence, 25 percent of such first costs of enhancement shall be provided by non-Federal interests under a schedule of reimbursement determined by the Secretary. The non-Federal share of operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources shall be 25 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National benefits from enhancement measures for Atchafalaya Floodway System and Mississippi Delta Region projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Fish and wildlife enhancement measures carried out as part of the project for Atchafalaya Floodway System, Louisiana, authorized by Public Law 99&ndash;88, and the project for Mississippi Delta Region, Louisiana, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1965, shall be considered to provide benefits that are national for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act supplementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (d) of this section shall be deemed to supplement the responsibility and authority of the Secretary pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act [16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], and nothing in this section is intended to affect that Act.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any technology covered by this section that becomes the subject of a cooperative research and development agreement shall be accorded the protection provided under section 12(c)(7)(B) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 3710a(c)(7)(B)) as if such technology had been developed under a cooperative research and development agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out this section, the Secretary may consider the recommendations of a non-Federal entity in identifying appropriate research or development projects and may enter into a cooperative research and development agreement, as defined in section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710a); except that in such agreement, the Secretary may agree to provide not more than 50 percent of the cost of any research or development project selected by the Secretary under this section. Not less than 5 percent of the non-Federal entity's share of the cost of any such project shall be paid in cash.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The research, development, or utilization of any technology pursuant to an agreement under subsection (c) of this section, including the terms under which such technology may be licensed and the resulting royalties may be distributed, shall be subject to the provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3701&ndash;3714).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To carry out the purposes of this section, there is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Army civil works funds $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1989, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1990, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1991, and $6,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter.</p>
