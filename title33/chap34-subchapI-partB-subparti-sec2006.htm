<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) By all vessels:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the state of visibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the traffic density including concentration of fishing vessels or any other vessels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the maneuverability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) at night the presence of background light such as from shores lights or from back scatter of her own lights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the state of wind, sea, and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) the draft in relation to the available depth of water.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:538 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather, and other sources of interference;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the number, location, and movement of vessels detected by radar; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) the more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.</p>
