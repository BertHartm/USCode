<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Permits for discharge of pollutants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344 of this title, the Administrator may, after opportunity for public hearing issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant, or combination of pollutants, notwithstanding section 1311(a) of this title, upon condition that such discharge will meet either (A) all applicable requirements under sections 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317, 1318, and 1343 of this title, or (B) prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions relating to all such requirements, such conditions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall prescribe conditions for such permits to assure compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection, including conditions on data and information collection, reporting, and such other requirements as he deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The permit program of the Administrator under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and permits issued thereunder, shall be subject to the same terms, conditions, and requirements as apply to a State permit program and permits issued thereunder under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All permits for discharges into the navigable waters issued pursuant to section 407 of this title shall be deemed to be permits issued under this subchapter, and permits issued under <!-- PDFPage:460 -->this subchapter shall be deemed to be permits issued under section 407 of this title, and shall continue in force and effect for their term unless revoked, modified, or suspended in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No permit for a discharge into the navigable waters shall be issued under section 407 of this title after October 18, 1972. Each application for a permit under section 407 of this title, pending on October 18, 1972, shall be deemed to be an application for a permit under this section. The Administrator shall authorize a State, which he determines has the capability of administering a permit program which will carry out the objectives of this chapter to issue permits for discharges into the navigable waters within the jurisdiction of such State. The Administrator may exercise the authority granted him by the preceding sentence only during the period which begins on October 18, 1972, and ends either on the ninetieth day after the date of the first promulgation of guidelines required by section 1314(i)(2) of this title, or the date of approval by the Administrator of a permit program for such State under subsection (b) of this section, whichever date first occurs, and no such authorization to a State shall extend beyond the last day of such period. Each such permit shall be subject to such conditions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. No such permit shall issue if the Administrator objects to such issuance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State permit programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time after the promulgation of the guidelines required by subsection (i)(2) of section 1314 of this title, the Governor of each State desiring to administer its own permit program for discharges into navigable waters within its jurisdiction may submit to the Administrator a full and complete description of the program it proposes to establish and administer under State law or under an interstate compact. In addition, such State shall submit a statement from the attorney general (or the attorney for those State water pollution control agencies which have independent legal counsel), or from the chief legal officer in the case of an interstate agency, that the laws of such State, or the interstate compact, as the case may be, provide adequate authority to carry out the described program. The Administrator shall approve each submitted program unless he determines that adequate authority does not exist:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To issue permits which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) can be terminated or modified for cause including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) violation of any condition of the permit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) obtaining a permit by misrepresentation, or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) change in any condition that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) control the disposal of pollutants into wells;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) To issue permits which apply, and insure compliance with, all applicable requirements of section 1318 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) To inspect, monitor, enter, and require reports to at least the same extent as required in section 1318 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To insure that the public, and any other State the waters of which may be affected, receive notice of each application for a permit and to provide an opportunity for public hearing before a ruling on each such application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To insure that the Administrator receives notice of each application (including a copy thereof) for a permit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) To insure that any State (other than the permitting State), whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may submit written recommendations to the permitting State (and the Administrator) with respect to any permit application and, if any part of such written recommendations are not accepted by the permitting State, that the permitting State will notify such affected State (and the Administrator) in writing of its failure to so accept such recommendations together with its reasons for so doing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) To insure that no permit will be issued if, in the judgment of the Secretary of the Army acting through the Chief of Engineers, after consultation with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, anchorage and navigation of any of the navigable waters would be substantially impaired thereby;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) To abate violations of the permit or the permit program, including civil and criminal penalties and other ways and means of enforcement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) To insure that any permit for a discharge from a publicly owned treatment works includes conditions to require the identification in terms of character and volume of pollutants of any significant source introducing pollutants subject to pretreatment standards under section 1317(b) of this title into such works and a program to assure compliance with such pretreatment standards by each such source, in addition to adequate notice to the permitting agency of (A) new introductions into such works of pollutants from any source which would be a new source as defined in section 1316 of this title if such source were discharging pollutants, (B) new introductions of pollutants into such works from a source which would be subject to section 1311 of this title if it were discharging such pollutants, or (C) a substantial change in volume or character of pollutants being introduced into such works by a source introducing pollutants into such works at the time of issuance of the permit. Such notice shall include information on the quality and quantity of effluent to be introduced into such treatment works and any anticipated impact of such change in the quantity or quality of effluent to be discharged from such publicly owned treatment works; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) To insure that any industrial user of any publicly owned treatment works will comply with sections 1284(b), 1317, and 1318 of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:461 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suspension of Federal program upon submission of State program; withdrawal of approval of State program; return of State program to Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than ninety days after the date on which a State has submitted a program (or revision thereof) pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of permits under subsection (a) of this section as to those discharges subject to such program unless he determines that the State permit program does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section or does not conform to the guidelines issued under section 1314(i)(2) of this title. If the Administrator so determines, he shall notify the State of any revisions or modifications necessary to conform to such requirements or guidelines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any State permit program under this section shall at all times be in accordance with this section and guidelines promulgated pursuant to section 1314(i)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the Administrator determines after public hearing that a State is not administering a program approved under this section in accordance with requirements of this section, he shall so notify the State and, if appropriate corrective action is not taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed ninety days, the Administrator shall withdraw approval of such program. The Administrator shall not withdraw approval of any such program unless he shall first have notified the State, and made public, in writing, the reasons for such withdrawal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on partial permit program returns and withdrawals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may return to the Administrator administration, and the Administrator may withdraw under paragraph (3) of this subsection approval, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a State partial permit program approved under subsection (n)(3) of this section only if the entire permit program being administered by the State department or agency at the time is returned or withdrawn; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a State partial permit program approved under subsection (n)(4) of this section only if an entire phased component of the permit program being administered by the State at the time is returned or withdrawn.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notification of Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each State shall transmit to the Administrator a copy of each permit application received by such State and provide notice to the Administrator of every action related to the consideration of such permit application, including each permit proposed to be issued by such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No permit shall issue (A) if the Administrator within ninety days of the date of his notification under subsection (b)(5) of this section objects in writing to the issuance of such permit, or (B) if the Administrator within ninety days of the date of transmittal of the proposed permit by the State objects in writing to the issuance of such permit as being outside the guidelines and requirements of this chapter. Whenever the Administrator objects to the issuance of a permit under this paragraph such written objection shall contain a statement of the reasons for such objection and the effluent limitations and conditions which such permit would include if it were issued by the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator may, as to any permit application, waive paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In any case where, after December 27, 1977, the Administrator, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, objects to the issuance of a permit, on request of the State, a public hearing shall be held by the Administrator on such objection. If the State does not resubmit such permit revised to meet such objection within 30 days after completion of the hearing, or, if no hearing is requested within 90 days after the date of such objection, the Administrator may issue the permit pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for such source in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of notification requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of section 1314 of this title, the Administrator is authorized to waive the requirements of subsection (d) of this section at the time he approves a program pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for any category (including any class, type, or size within such category) of point sources within the State submitting such program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Point source categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing categories of point sources which he determines shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section in any State with a program approved pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes within any category of point sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Other regulations for safe transportation, handling, carriage, storage, and stowage of pollutants</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Violation of permit conditions; restriction or prohibition upon introduction of pollutant by source not previously utilizing treatment works</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event any condition of a permit for discharges from a treatment works (as defined in section 1292 of this title) which is publicly owned is violated, a State with a program approved under subsection (b) of this section or the Administrator, where no State program is approved or where the Administrator determines pursuant to section 1319(a) of this title that a State with an approved program has not commenced appropriate enforcement action with respect to such permit, may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction to restrict or prohibit the introduction of any pollutant into such treatment works by a source not utilizing such treatment works prior to the finding that such condition was violated.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:462 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Federal enforcement not limited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Administrator to take action pursuant to section 1319 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Public information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A copy of each permit application and each permit issued under this section shall be available to the public. Such permit application or permit, or portion thereof, shall further be available on request for the purpose of reproduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Compliance with permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed compliance, for purposes of sections 1319 and 1365 of this title, with sections 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317, and 1343 of this title, except any standard imposed under section 1317 of this title for a toxic pollutant injurious to human health. Until December 31, 1974, in any case where a permit for discharge has been applied for pursuant to this section, but final administrative disposition of such application has not been made, such discharge shall not be a violation of (1) section 1311, 1316, or 1342 of this title, or (2) section 407 of this title, unless the Administrator or other plaintiff proves that final administrative disposition of such application has not been made because of the failure of the applicant to furnish information reasonably required or requested in order to process the application. For the 180-day period beginning on October 18, 1972, in the case of any point source discharging any pollutant or combination of pollutants immediately prior to such date which source is not subject to section 407 of this title, the discharge by such source shall not be a violation of this chapter if such a source applies for a permit for discharge pursuant to this section within such 180-day period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Limitation on permit requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Agricultural return flows</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall not require a permit under this section for discharges composed entirely of return flows from irrigated agriculture, nor shall the Administrator directly or indirectly, require any State to require such a permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stormwater runoff from oil, gas, and mining operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall not require a permit under this section, nor shall the Administrator directly or indirectly require any State to require a permit, for discharges of stormwater runoff from mining operations or oil and gas exploration, production, processing, or treatment operations or transmission facilities, composed entirely of flows which are from conveyances or systems of conveyances (including but not limited to pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels) used for collecting and conveying precipitation runoff and which are not contaminated by contact with, or do not come into contact with, any overburden, raw material, intermediate products, finished product, byproduct, or waste products located on the site of such operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Additional pretreatment of conventional pollutants not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent a treatment works (as defined in section 1292 of this title) which is publicly owned is not meeting the requirements of a permit issued under this section for such treatment works as a result of inadequate design or operation of such treatment works, the Administrator, in issuing a permit under this section, shall not require pretreatment by a person introducing conventional pollutants identified pursuant to section 1314(a)(4) of this title into such treatment works other than pretreatment required to assure compliance with pretreatment standards under subsection (b)(8) of this section and section 1317(b)(1) of this title. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the Administrator's authority under sections 1317 and 1319 of this title, affect State and local authority under sections 1317(b)(4) and 1370 of this title, relieve such treatment works of its obligations to meet requirements established under this chapter, or otherwise preclude such works from pursuing whatever feasible options are available to meet its responsibility to comply with its permit under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Partial permit program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Governor of a State may submit under subsection (b) of this section a permit program for a portion of the discharges into the navigable waters in such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partial permit program under this subsection shall cover, at a minimum, administration of a major category of the discharges into the navigable waters of the State or a major component of the permit program required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Approval of major category partial permit programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may approve a partial permit program covering administration of a major category of discharges under this subsection if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such program represents a complete permit program and covers all of the discharges under the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Administrator determines that the partial program represents a significant and identifiable part of the State program required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Approval of major component partial permit programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may approve under this subsection a partial and phased permit program covering administration of a major component (including discharge categories) of a State permit program required by subsection (b) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Administrator determines that the partial program represents a significant and identifiable part of the State program required by subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State submits, and the Administrator approves, a plan for the State to assume administration by phases of the re<!-- PDFPage:463 -->mainder of the State program required by subsection (b) of this section by a specified date not more than 5 years after submission of the partial program under this subsection and agrees to make all reasonable efforts to assume such administration by such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Anti-backsliding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of effluent limitations established on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or modified on the basis of effluent guidelines promulgated under section 1314(b) of this title subsequent to the original issuance of such permit, to contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than the comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit. In the case of effluent limitations established on the basis of section 1311(b)(1)(C) or section 1313(d) or (e) of this title, a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than the comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit except in compliance with section 1313(d)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A permit with respect to which paragraph (1) applies may be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a less stringent effluent limitation applicable to a pollutant if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) material and substantial alterations or additions to the permitted facility occurred after permit issuance which justify the application of a less stringent effluent limitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) information is available which was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and which would have justified the application of a less stringent effluent limitation at the time of permit issuance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Administrator determines that technical mistakes or mistaken interpretations of law were made in issuing the permit under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a less stringent effluent limitation is necessary because of events over which the permittee has no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the permittee has received a permit modification under section 1311(c), 1311(g), 1311(h), 1311(i), 1311(k), 1311(n), or 1326(a) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the permittee has installed the treatment facilities required to meet the effluent limitations in the previous permit and has properly operated and maintained the facilities but has nevertheless been unable to achieve the previous effluent limitations, in which case the limitations in the reviewed, reissued, or modified permit may reflect the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall not be less stringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time of permit renewal, reissuance, or modification).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any revised waste load allocations or any alternative grounds for translating water quality standards into effluent limitations, except where the cumulative effect of such revised allocations results in a decrease in the amount of pollutants discharged into the concerned waters, and such revised allocations are not the result of a discharger eliminating or substantially reducing its discharge of pollutants due to complying with the requirements of this chapter or for reasons otherwise unrelated to water quality.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In no event may a permit with respect to which paragraph (1) applies be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain an effluent limitation which is less stringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time the permit is renewed, reissued, or modified. In no event may such a permit to discharge into waters be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a less stringent effluent limitation if the implementation of such limitation would result in a violation of a water quality standard under section 1313 of this title applicable to such waters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Municipal and industrial stormwater discharges</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to October 1, 1994, the Administrator or the State (in the case of a permit program approved under this section) shall not require a permit under this section for discharges composed entirely of stormwater.</p>
