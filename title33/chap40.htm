<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Division of liability for mobile offshore drilling units</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Treated first as tank vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining the responsible party and applying this Act and except as provided in paragraph (2), a mobile offshore drilling unit which is being used as an offshore facility is deemed to be a tank vessel with respect to the discharge, or the substantial threat of a discharge, of oil on or above the surface of the water.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treated as facility for excess liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that removal costs and damages from any incident described in paragraph (1) exceed the amount for which a responsible party is liable (as that amount may be limited under subsection (a)(1) of this section), the mobile offshore drilling unit is deemed to be an offshore facility. For purposes of applying subsection (a)(3) of this section, the amount specified in that subsection shall be reduced by the amount for which the responsible party is liable under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Acts of responsible party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) of this section does not apply if the incident was proximately caused by&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the responsible party, an agent or employee of the responsible party, or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship with the responsible party (except where the sole contractual arrangement arises in connection with carriage by a common carrier by rail).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure or refusal of responsible party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) of this section does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to report the incident as required by law and the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance requested by a responsible official in connection with removal activities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) without sufficient cause, to comply with an order issued under subsection (c) or (e) of section 1321 of this title or the Intervention on the High Seas Act (33 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) OCS facility or vessel</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a tank vessel that is designated in its certificate of inspection as an oil spill response vessel (as that term is defined in section 2101 of title 46) and that is used solely for removal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:670 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjusting limits of liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Onshore facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the President may establish by regulation, with respect to any class or category of onshore facility, a limit of liability under this section of less than $350,000,000, but not less than $8,000,000, taking into account size, storage capacity, oil throughput, proximity to sensitive areas, type of oil handled, history of discharges, and other factors relevant to risks posed by the class or category of facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deepwater ports and associated vessels</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall conduct a study of the relative operational and environmental risks posed by the transportation of oil by vessel to deepwater ports (as defined in section 1502 of this title) versus the transportation of oil by vessel to other ports. The study shall include a review and analysis of offshore lightering practices used in connection with that transportation, an analysis of the volume of oil transported by vessel using those practices, and an analysis of the frequency and volume of oil discharges which occur in connection with the use of those practices.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after August 18, 1990, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report on the results of the study conducted under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rulemaking proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines, based on the results of the study conducted under this&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2704_2_target" name="2704_2">2</a></sup> subparagraph (A), that the use of deepwater ports in connection with the transportation of oil by vessel results in a lower operational or environmental risk than the use of other ports, the Secretary shall initiate, not later than the 180th day following the date of submission of the report to the Congress under subparagraph (B), a rulemaking proceeding to lower the limits of liability under this section for deepwater ports as the Secretary determines appropriate. The Secretary may establish a limit of liability of less than $350,000,000, but not less than $50,000,000, in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Periodic reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall, within 6 months after August 18, 1990, and from time to time thereafter, report to the Congress on the desirability of adjusting the limits of liability specified in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Adjustment to reflect Consumer Price Index</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President, by regulations issued not later than 3 years after July 11, 2006, and not less than every 3 years thereafter, shall adjust the limits on liability specified in subsection (a) to reflect significant increases in the Consumer Price Index.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The responsible party or the responsible party's guarantor is liable to a claimant for interest on the amount paid in satisfaction of a claim under this Act for the period described in subsection (b) of this section. The responsible party shall establish a procedure for the payment or settlement of claims for interim, short-term damages. Payment or settlement of a claim for interim, short-term damages representing less than the full amount of damages to which the claimant ultimately may be entitled shall not preclude recovery by the claimant for damages not reflected in the paid or settled partial claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Period</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the period for which interest shall be paid is the period beginning on the 30th day following the date on which the claim is presented to the responsible party or guarantor and ending on the date on which the claim is paid.</p>

If the offer is made within 60 days after the date on which the claim is presented under section 2713(a) of this title, the period described in paragraph (1) does not include any period before the offer is accepted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusion of periods in interests of justice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If in any period a claimant is not paid due to reasons beyond the control of the responsible party or because it would not serve the interests of justice, no interest shall accrue under this section during that period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Calculation of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interest paid under this section shall be calculated at the average of the highest rate for commercial and finance company paper of maturities of 180 days or less obtaining on each of the days included within the period for which interest must be paid to the claimant, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title and findings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the March 24, 1989, grounding and rupture of the fully loaded oil tanker, the EXXON VALDEZ, spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound, an environmentally sensitive area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) many people believe that complacency on the part of the industry and government personnel responsible for monitoring the operation of the Valdez terminal and vessel traffic in Prince William Sound was one of the contributing factors to the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) one way to combat this complacency is to involve local citizens in the process of preparing, adopting, and revising oil spill contingency plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a mechanism should be established which fosters the long-term partnership of industry, government, and local communities in overseeing compliance with environmental concerns in the operation of crude oil terminals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such a mechanism presently exists at the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands and this terminal should serve as a model for others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) because of the effective partnership that has developed at Sullom Voe, Sullom Voe is considered the safest terminal in Europe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the present system of regulation and oversight of crude oil terminals in the United States has degenerated into a process of continual mistrust and confrontation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) only when local citizens are involved in the process will the trust develop that is necessary to change the present system from confrontation to consensus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a pilot program patterned after Sullom Voe should be established in Alaska to further refine the concepts and relationships involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) similar programs should eventually be established in other major crude oil terminals in the United States because the recent oil spills in Texas, Delaware, and Rhode Island indicate that the safe transportation of crude oil is a national problem.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Demonstration programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There are established 2 Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Demonstration Programs (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Programs&rdquo;) to be carried out in the State of Alaska.</p>
