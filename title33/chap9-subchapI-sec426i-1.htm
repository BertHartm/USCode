<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) By Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon request of an appropriate non-Federal interest, the Secretary may undertake all necessary studies and engineering for any construction to be undertaken under subsection (a) of this section and provide technical assistance in obtaining all necessary permits for such construction if the non-Federal interest contracts with the Secretary to furnish the United States funds for the studies and engineering during the period that the studies and engineering will be conducted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Completion of studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to complete and transmit to the appropriate non-Federal interests any study for shoreline protection which was initiated before October 31, 1992, or, upon the request of such non-Federal interest, to terminate the study and transmit the partially completed study to the non-Federal interest for completion. Studies subject to this subsection shall be completed without regard to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority to carry out improvement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any non-Federal interest which has received from the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section a favorable recommendation to carry out a shoreline protection project or separable element thereof, based on the results of completed studies and engineering for the project or element, may carry out the project or element if a final environmental impact statement has been filed for the project or element.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any plan of improvement proposed to be implemented in accordance with this subsection shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for obtaining the appropriate permits required under the Secretary's authority and such permits shall be granted subject to the non-Federal interest's acceptance of the terms and conditions of such permits if the Secretary determines that the applicable regulatory criteria and procedures have been satisfied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if, after authorization and before initiation of construction of the project or separable element, the Secretary approves the plans for construction of such project by such non-Federal interest and enters into a written agreement with the non-Federal interest with respect to the project or separable element (including the terms of cooperation); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the Secretary finds, after a review of studies and engineering prepared pursuant to this section, that construction of the project or separable element is economically justified and environmentally acceptable.</p>
