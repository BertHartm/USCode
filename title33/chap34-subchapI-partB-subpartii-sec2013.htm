<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 4 through 18, any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Overtaking vessel defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam; that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assumption that vessel is overtaking another in cases of doubt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Overtaking vessel to become crossing vessel only when finally past and clear</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.</p>
