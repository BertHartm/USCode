<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2732. Terminal and tanker oversight and monitoring</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title and findings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the March 24, 1989, grounding and rupture of the fully loaded oil tanker, the EXXON VALDEZ, spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound, an environmentally sensitive area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) many people believe that complacency on the part of the industry and government personnel responsible for monitoring the operation of the Valdez terminal and vessel traffic in Prince William Sound was one of the contributing factors to the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) one way to combat this complacency is to involve local citizens in the process of preparing, adopting, and revising oil spill contingency plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a mechanism should be established which fosters the long-term partnership of industry, government, and local communities in overseeing compliance with environmental concerns in the operation of crude oil terminals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such a mechanism presently exists at the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands and this terminal should serve as a model for others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) because of the effective partnership that has developed at Sullom Voe, Sullom Voe is considered the safest terminal in Europe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the present system of regulation and oversight of crude oil terminals in the United States has degenerated into a process of continual mistrust and confrontation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) only when local citizens are involved in the process will the trust develop that is necessary to change the present system from confrontation to consensus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a pilot program patterned after Sullom Voe should be established in Alaska to further refine the concepts and relationships involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) similar programs should eventually be established in other major crude oil terminals in the United States because the recent oil spills in Texas, Delaware, and Rhode Island indicate that the safe transportation of crude oil is a national problem.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Demonstration programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There are established 2 Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Demonstration Programs (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Programs&rdquo;) to be carried out in the State of Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advisory function</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The function of these Programs shall be advisory only.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Prince William Sound Program shall be responsible for environmental monitoring of the terminal facilities in Prince William Sound and the crude oil tankers operating in Prince William Sound. The Cook Inlet Program shall be responsible for environmental monitoring of the terminal facilities and crude oil tankers operating in Cook Inlet located South of the latitude at Point Possession and North of the latitude at Amatuli Island, including offshore facilities in Cook Inlet.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Suits barred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No program, association, council, committee or other organization created by this section may sue any person or entity, public or private, concerning any matter arising under this section except for the performance of contracts.</p>
