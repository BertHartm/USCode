<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Secretary of the Navy with respect to additional station or signal lights and shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or by the Secretary with respect to additional station or signal lights and shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights and shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape, or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General characteristics of action taken to avoid collision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any action taken to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Readily apparent alterations in course or speed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alteration of course or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course or speed should be avoided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alteration of course to avoid close-quarters situation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Action to result in passing at safe distance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Slackening of vessel speed; stopping or reversing means of propulsion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Early action to allow room for safe passage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the other vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A vessel required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of this part.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Whistle signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When power-driven vessels are in sight of one another and meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other, each vessel underway, when maneuvering as authorized or required by these Rules:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall indicate that maneuver by the following signals on her whistle: one short blast to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my port side&rdquo;; two short blasts to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my starboard side&rdquo;; and three short blasts to mean &ldquo;I am operating astern propulsion&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) upon hearing the one or two blast signal of the other shall, if in agreement, sound the same whistle signal and take the steps necessary to effect a safe passing. If, however, from any cause, the vessel doubts the safety of the proposed maneuver, she shall sound the danger signal specified in paragraph (d) of this Rule and each vessel shall take appropriate precautionary action until a safe passing agreement is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Light signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule by light signals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) These signals shall have the following significance: one flash to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my port side&rdquo;; two flashes to mean &ldquo;I intend to leave you on my starboard side&rdquo;; three flashes to mean &ldquo;I am operating astern propulsion&rdquo;;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:571 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The duration of each flash shall be about 1 second; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The light used for this signal shall, if fitted, be one all-round white or yellow light, visible at a minimum range of 2 miles, synchronized with the whistle, and shall comply with the provisions of Annex I to these Rules.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Overtaking situations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in sight of one another:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a power-driven vessel intending to overtake another power-driven vessel shall indicate her intention by the following signals on her whistle: one short blast to mean &ldquo;I intend to overtake you on your starboard side&rdquo;; two short blasts to mean &ldquo;I intend to overtake you on your port side&rdquo;; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the power-driven vessel about to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound a similar sound signal. If in doubt she shall sound the danger signal prescribed in paragraph (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Doubts or failure to understand signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and from any cause either vessel fails to understand the intentions or actions of the other, or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision, the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. This signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least five short and rapid flashes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Vessels in areas of obscured visibility due to intervening obstructions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound one prolonged blast. This signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel that may be within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Use of one whistle only on a vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, one whistle only shall be used for giving maneuvering and warning signals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Power-driven vessels leaving dock or berth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a power-driven vessel is leaving a dock or berth, she shall sound one prolonged blast.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Agreement between vessels using radiotelephone</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel that reaches agreement with another vessel in a head-on, crossing, or overtaking situation, as for example, by using the radiotelephone as prescribed by the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act (85 Stat. 164; 33 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.), is not obliged to sound the whistle signals prescribed by this rule,<sup><a href="#2034_1_target" name="2034_1">1</a></sup> but may do so.
