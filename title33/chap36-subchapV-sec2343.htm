<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Project studies subject to independent peer review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The peer review may include a review of the economic and environmental assumptions and projections, project evaluation data, economic analyses, environmental analyses, engineering analyses, formulation of alternative plans, methods for integrating risk and uncertainty, models used in evaluation of economic or environmental impacts of proposed projects, and any biological opinions of the project study.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Project studies subject to peer review</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Mandatory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A project study shall be subject to peer review under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the project has an estimated total cost of more than $45,000,000, including mitigation costs, and is not determined by the Chief of Engineers to be exempt from peer review under paragraph (6);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Governor of an affected State requests a peer review by an independent panel of experts; or</p>
