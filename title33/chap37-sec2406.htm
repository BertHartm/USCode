<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Estuarine monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, shall monitor the concentrations of organotin in the water column, sediments, and aquatic organisms of representative estuaries and near-coastal waters in the United States. This monitoring program shall remain in effect until 10 years after June 16, 1988. The Administrator shall submit a report annually to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the President pro tempore of the Senate detailing the results of such monitoring program for the preceding year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Navy home port monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide for periodic monitoring, not less than quarterly, of waters serving as the home port for any Navy vessel coated with an antifouling paint containing organotin to determine the concentration of organotin in the water column, sediments, and aquatic organisms of such waters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Navy research of ecological effects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall continue existing Navy programs evaluating the laboratory toxicity and environmental risks associated with the use of antifouling paints containing organotin.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance to States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent practicable, the Administrator shall assist States in monitoring waters in such States for the presence of organotin and in analyzing samples taken during such monitoring.</p>
