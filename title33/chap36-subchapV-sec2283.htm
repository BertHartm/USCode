<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Steps to be taken prior to or concurrently with construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any water resources project which is authorized to be constructed by the Secretary before, on, or after November 17, 1986, construction of which has not commenced as of November 17, 1986, and which necessitates the mitigation of fish and wildlife losses, including the acquisition of lands or interests in lands to mitigate losses to fish and wildlife, as a result of such project, such mitigation, including acquisition of the lands or interests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be undertaken or acquired before any construction of the project (other than such acquisition) commences, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be undertaken or acquired concurrently with lands and interests in lands for project purposes (other than mitigation of fish and wildlife losses),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever the Secretary determines is appropriate, except that any physical construction required for the purposes of mitigation may be undertaken concurrently with the physical construction of such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection, any project authorized before November 17, 1986, on which more than 50 percent of the land needed for the project, exclusive of mitigation lands, has been acquired shall be deemed to have commenced construction under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acquisition of lands or interests in lands for mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After consultation with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies, the Secretary is authorized to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife resulting from any water resources project under his jurisdiction, whether completed, under construction, or to be constructed. Such mitigation may include the acquisition of lands, or interests therein, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquisition under this paragraph shall not be by condemnation in the case of projects completed as of November 17, 1986, or on which at least 10 percent of the physical construction on the project has been completed as of November 17, 1986; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquisition of water, or interests therein, under this paragraph, shall not be by condemnation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary, shall, under the terms of this paragraph, obligate no more than $30,000,000 in any fiscal year. With respect to any water resources project, the authority under this subsection shall not apply to measures that cost more than $7,500,000 or 10 percent of the cost of the project, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever, after his review, the Secretary determines that such mitigation features under this subsection are likely to require condemnation under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report on such proposed modification, together with his recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of mitigation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Costs incurred after November 17, 1986, including lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations, for implementation and operation, main<!-- PDFPage:582 -->tenance, and rehabilitation to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife shall be allocated among authorized project purposes in accordance with applicable cost allocation procedures, and shall be subject to cost sharing or reimbursement to the same extent as such other project costs are shared or reimbursed, except that when such costs are covered by contracts entered into prior to November 17, 1986, such costs shall not be recovered without the consent of the non-Federal interests or until such contracts are complied with or renegotiated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mitigation plans as part of project proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After November 17, 1986, the Secretary shall not submit any proposal for the authorization of any water resources project to the Congress unless such report contains (1) a recommendation with a specific plan to mitigate fish and wildlife losses created by such project, or (2) a determination by the Secretary that such project will have negligible adverse impact on fish and wildlife. Specific mitigation plans shall ensure that impacts to bottomland hardwood forests are mitigated in-kind, to the extent possible. In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) First enhancement costs as Federal costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In those cases when the Secretary, as part of any report to Congress, recommends activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources, the first costs of such enhancement shall be a Federal cost when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such enhancement provides benefits that are determined to be national, including benefits to species that are identified by the National Marine Fisheries Service as of national economic importance, species that are subject to treaties or international convention to which the United States is a party, and anadromous fish;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such enhancement is designed to benefit species that have been listed as threatened or endangered by the Secretary of the Interior under the terms of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such activities are located on lands managed as a national wildlife refuge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">When benefits of enhancement do not qualify under the preceding sentence, 25 percent of such first costs of enhancement shall be provided by non-Federal interests under a schedule of reimbursement determined by the Secretary. The non-Federal share of operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources shall be 25 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National benefits from enhancement measures for Atchafalaya Floodway System and Mississippi Delta Region projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Fish and wildlife enhancement measures carried out as part of the project for Atchafalaya Floodway System, Louisiana, authorized by Public Law 99&ndash;88, and the project for Mississippi Delta Region, Louisiana, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1965, shall be considered to provide benefits that are national for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act supplementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (d) of this section shall be deemed to supplement the responsibility and authority of the Secretary pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act [16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], and nothing in this section is intended to affect that Act.</p>
