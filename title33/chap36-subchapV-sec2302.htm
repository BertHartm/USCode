<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary shall, on an annual basis, transmit to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate, a report describing the number and dollar amount of contracts awarded in each industry category or subcategory broken down by Engineer District of the Army Corps of Engineers. Such report shall include the number and dollar amount of contracts (A) set aside for small business concerns; (B) awarded to small business or small disadvantaged business concerns; (C) available for competition by qualified firms of all sizes; and (D) awarded to other than small business or small disadvantaged business concerns.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, the term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;contract&rdquo; means any contract, or any subcontract in connection with a subcontracting plan entered into pursuant to section 637(d) of title 15, which is funded through appropriations made available to the Corps of Engineers-Civil; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;industry category or subcategory&rdquo; means the four digit SIC category or subcategory defined by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In the interest of efficient and cost effective operations by the Secretary, the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study of the Secretary's contracting procedures for civil works projects. Such study shall examine whether potential bidders or offerors, regardless of their size, are allowed to compete fairly in the interest of lowering cost on contracts for construction. Within two years of November 17, 1986, the Comptroller General shall report his findings to Congress together with an assessment of whether contract procedures are applied uniformly among the various field offices under the Secretary's jurisdiction. The report shall also provide recommendations on improving contracting procedures, including (1) how the Secretary can prepare proposals for construction that assure, to the greatest extent reasonable, that no potential bidder or offeror is precluded from competing fairly for contracts, (2) whether recordkeeping requirements imposed by the Secretary on contractors are appropriate in the interest of competition, and (3) the extent to which the private sector can be used more efficiently by the Secretary in contracting for construction, architecture, engineering, surveying, and mapping.</p>
