<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Term</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the payment of fees under this title, such grant shall be for a term beginning on the date on which the patent issues and ending 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, if the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications under section 120, 121, or 365(c) of this title, from the date on which the earliest such application was filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Priority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Priority under section 119, 365(a), or 365(b) of this title shall not be taken into account in determining the term of a patent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Specification and drawing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A copy of the specification and drawing shall be annexed to the patent and be a part of such patent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Interference delay or secrecy orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the issue of an original patent is delayed due to a proceeding under section 135(a) of this title, or because the application for patent is placed under an order pursuant to section 181 of this title, the term of the patent shall be extended for the period of delay, but in no case more than 5 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Extension for appellate review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the issue of a patent is delayed due to appellate <!-- PDFPage:37 -->review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or by a Federal court and the patent is issued pursuant to a decision in the review reversing an adverse determination of patentability, the term of the patent shall be extended for a period of time but in no case more than 5 years. A patent shall not be eligible for extension under this paragraph if it is subject to a terminal disclaimer due to the issue of another patent claiming subject matter that is not patentably distinct from that under appellate review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The period of extension referred to in paragraph (2)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall include any period beginning on the date on which an appeal is filed under section 134 or 141 of this title, or on which an action is commenced under section 145 of this title, and ending on the date of a final decision in favor of the applicant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be reduced by any time attributable to appellate review before the expiration of 3 years from the filing date of the application for patent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall be reduced for the period of time during which the applicant for patent did not act with due diligence, as determined by the Commissioner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Length of extension</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The total duration of all extensions of a patent under this subsection shall not exceed 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Continuation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term of a patent that is in force on or that results from an application filed before the date that is 6 months after the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act shall be the greater of the 20-year term as provided in subsection (a), or 17 years from grant, subject to any terminal disclaimers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The remedies of sections 283, 284, and 285 of this title shall not apply to acts which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) were commenced or for which substantial investment was made before the date that is 6 months after the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Remuneration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The acts referred to in paragraph (2) may be continued only upon the payment of an equitable remuneration to the patentee that is determined in an action brought under chapter 28 and chapter 29 (other than those provisions excluded by paragraph (2)) of this title.</p>
