<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Reexamination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 3 months after the filing of a request for inter partes reexamination under section 311, the Director shall determine whether a substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent concerned is raised by the request, with or without consideration of other patents or printed publications. The existence of a substantial new question of patentability is not precluded by the fact that a patent or printed publication was previously cited by or to the Office or considered by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Record</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A record of the Director's determination under subsection (a) shall be placed in the official file of the patent, and a copy shall be promptly given or mailed to the owner of record of the patent and to the third-party requester.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Final Decision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A determination by the Director under subsection (a) shall be final and non-appealable. Upon a determination that no substantial new question of patentability has been raised, the Director may refund a portion of the inter partes reexamination fee required under section 311.</p>
