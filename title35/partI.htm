<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;all&rdquo; is omitted from the corresponding section of the existing statute and &ldquo;except as otherwise provided by law&rdquo; added, since some old records are kept in the National Archives, see 44 U.S.C., 1946 ed., ch. 8A.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;models&rdquo; has been omitted to remove emphasis on models since they are no longer generally required. They are included by the word &ldquo;things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;and to trade-mark registrations&rdquo; is added. There is no enactment corresponding to this section in the trade-mark law. The original chapter of the Revised Statutes containing this section deals with the Patent Office as such in its administration of trade-marks as well as patents. This is explicitly brought out in some of the corresponding sections of the present chapter. Changes in language are made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The fees established in subsections (a) and (b) of this section may be adjusted by the Commissioner on October 1, 1992, and every year thereafter, to reflect any fluctuations occurring during the previous 12 months in the Consumer Price Index, as determined by the Secretary of <!-- PDFPage:13 -->Labor. Changes of less than 1 per centum may be ignored.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Fees charged under subsection (a) or (b) shall be reduced by 50 percent with respect to their application to any small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act, and to any independent inventor or nonprofit organization as defined in regulations issued by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to its application to any entity described in paragraph (1), any surcharge or fee charged under subsection (c) or (d) shall not be higher than the surcharge or fee required of any other entity under the same or substantially similar circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The Commissioner shall maintain, for use by the public, paper or microform collections of United States patents, foreign patent documents, and United States trademark registrations arranged to permit search for and retrieval of information.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commissioner shall provide for the full deployment of the automated search systems of the Patent and Trademark Office so that such systems are available for use by the public, and shall assure full access by the public to, and dissemination of, patent and trademark information, using a variety of automated methods, including electronic bulletin boards and remote access by users to mass storage and retrieval systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commissioner may establish reasonable fees for access by the public to the automated search systems of the Patent and Trademark Office. If such fees are established, a limited amount of free access shall be made available to users of the systems for purposes of education and training. The Commissioner may waive the payment by an individual of fees authorized by this subsection upon a showing of need or hardship, and if such a waiver is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commissioner shall submit to the Congress an annual report on the automated search systems of the Patent and Trademark Office and the access by the public to such systems. The Commissioner shall also publish such report in the Federal Register. The Commissioner shall provide an opportunity for the submission of comments by interested persons on each such report.</p>
