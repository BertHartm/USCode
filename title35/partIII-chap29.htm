<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A patent shall be presumed valid. Each claim of a patent (whether in independent, dependent, or multiple dependent form) shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims; dependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a claim to a composition of matter is held invalid and that claim was the basis of a determination of nonobviousness under section 103(b)(1), the process shall no longer be considered nonobvious solely on the basis of section 103(b)(1). The burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The following shall be defenses in any action involving the validity or infringement of a patent and shall be pleaded:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Noninfringement, absence of liability for infringement or unenforceability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit on any ground specified in part II of this title as a condition for patentability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with any requirement of sections 112 or 251 of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any other fact or act made a defense by this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">In actions involving the validity or infringement of a patent the party asserting invalidity or noninfringement shall give notice in the pleadings or otherwise in writing to the adverse party at least thirty days before the trial, of the country, number, date, and name of the patentee of any patent, the title, date, and page numbers of any publication to be relied upon as anticipation of the patent in suit or, except in actions in the United States Court of Federal Claims, as showing the state of the art, and the name and address of any person who may be relied upon as the prior inventor or as having prior knowledge of or as having previously used or offered for sale the invention of the patent in suit. In the absence of such notice proof of the said matters may not be made at the trial except on such terms as the court requires. Invalidity of the extension of a patent term or any portion thereof under section 154(b) or 156 of this title because of the material failure&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by the Director,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">to comply with the requirements of such section shall be a defense in any action involving the infringement of a patent during the period of the extension of its term and shall be pleaded.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;287. Limitation on damages and other remedies; marking and notice</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Patentees, and persons making, offering for sale, or selling within the United States any patented article for or under them, or importing any patented article into the United States, may give notice to the public that the same is patented, either by fixing thereon the word &ldquo;patent&rdquo; or the abbreviation &ldquo;pat.&rdquo;, together with the number of the patent, or when, from the character of the article, this can not be done, by fixing to it, or to the package wherein one or more of them is contained, a label containing a like notice. In the event of failure so to mark, no damages shall be recovered by the patentee in any action for infringement, except on proof that the infringer was notified of the infringement and continued to infringe thereafter, in which event damages may be recovered only for infringement occurring after such notice. Filing of an action for infringement shall constitute such notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An infringer under section 271(g) shall be subject to all the provisions of this title relating to damages and injunctions except to the extent those remedies are modified by this subsection or section 9006 of the Process Patent Amendments Act of 1988. The modifications of remedies provided in this subsection shall not be available to any person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) practiced the patented process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) owns or controls, or is owned or controlled by, the person who practiced the patented process; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) had knowledge before the infringement that a patented process was used to make the product the importation, use, offer for sale, or sale of which constitutes the infringement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No remedies for infringement under section 271(g) of this title shall be available with respect to any product in the possession of, or in transit to, the person subject to liability under such section before that person had notice of infringement with respect to that product. The person subject to liability shall bear the burden of proving any such possession or transit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In making a determination with respect to the remedy in an action brought for infringement under section 271(g), the court shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the good faith demonstrated by the defendant with respect to a request for disclosure,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the good faith demonstrated by the plaintiff with respect to a request for disclosure, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the need to restore the exclusive rights secured by the patent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the following are evidence of good faith:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a request for disclosure made by the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a response within a reasonable time by the person receiving the request for disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the submission of the response by the defendant to the manufacturer, or if the manufacturer is not known, to the supplier, of the product to be purchased by the defendant, together with a request for a written statement that the process claimed in any patent disclosed in the response is not used to produce such product.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The failure to perform any acts described in the preceding sentence is evidence of absence of good faith unless there are mitigating circumstances. Mitigating circumstances include the case in which, due to the nature of the product, the number of sources for the product, or like commercial circumstances, a request for disclosure is not necessary or practicable to avoid infringement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of this subsection, a &ldquo;request for disclosure&rdquo; means a written request made to a person then engaged in the manufacture of a product to identify all process patents owned by or licensed to that person, as of the time of the request, that the person then reasonably believes could be asserted to be infringed under section 271(g) if that product were imported into, or sold, offered for sale, or used in, the United States by an unauthorized person. A request for disclosure is further limited to a request&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) which is made by a person regularly engaged in the United States in the sale of the same type of products as those manufactured by the person to whom the request is directed, or which includes facts showing that the person making the request plans to engage in the sale of such products in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) which is made by such person before the person's first importation, use, offer for sale, or sale of units of the product produced by an infringing process and before the person had notice of infringement with respect to the product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) which includes a representation by the person making the request that such person will promptly submit the patents identified <!-- PDFPage:85 -->pursuant to the request to the manufacturer, or if the manufacturer is not known, to the supplier, of the product to be purchased by the person making the request, and will request from that manufacturer or supplier a written statement that none of the processes claimed in those patents is used in the manufacture of the product.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a request for disclosure received by a person to whom a patent is licensed, that person shall either identify the patent or promptly notify the licensor of the request for disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A person who has marked, in the manner prescribed by subsection (a), the number of the process patent on all products made by the patented process which have been offered for sale or sold by that person in the United States, or imported by the person into the United States, before a request for disclosure is received is not required to respond to the request for disclosure. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;all products&rdquo; does not include products made before the effective date of the Process Patent Amendments Act of 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For purposes of this subsection, notice of infringement means actual knowledge, or receipt by a person of a written notification, or a combination thereof, of information sufficient to persuade a reasonable person that it is likely that a product was made by a process patented in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A written notification from the patent holder charging a person with infringement shall specify the patented process alleged to have been used and the reasons for a good faith belief that such process was used. The patent holder shall include in the notification such information as is reasonably necessary to explain fairly the patent holder's belief, except that the patent holder is not required to disclose any trade secret information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A person who receives a written notification described in subparagraph (B) or a written response to a request for disclosure described in paragraph (4) shall be deemed to have notice of infringement with respect to any patent referred to in such written notification or response unless that person, absent mitigating circumstances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) promptly transmits the written notification or response to the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer is not known, to the supplier, of the product purchased or to be purchased by that person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) receives a written statement from the manufacturer or supplier which on its face sets forth a well grounded factual basis for a belief that the identified patents are not infringed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection, a person who obtains a product made by a process patented in the United States in a quantity which is abnormally large in relation to the volume of business of such person or an efficient inventory level shall be rebuttably presumed to have actual knowledge that the product was made by such patented process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A person who receives a response to a request for disclosure under this subsection shall pay to the person to whom the request was made a reasonable fee to cover actual costs incurred in complying with the request, which may not exceed the cost of a commercially available automated patent search of the matter involved, but in no case more than $500.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) With respect to a medical practitioner's performance of a medical activity that constitutes an infringement under section 271(a) or (b) of this title, the provisions of sections 281, 283, 284, and 285 of this title shall not apply against the medical practitioner or against a related health care entity with respect to such medical activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;medical activity&rdquo; means the performance of a medical or surgical procedure on a body, but shall not include (i) the use of a patented machine, manufacture, or composition of matter in violation of such patent, (ii) the practice of a patented use of a composition of matter in violation of such patent, or (iii) the practice of a process in violation of a biotechnology patent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; means any natural person who is licensed by a State to provide the medical activity described in subsection (c)(1) or who is acting under the direction of such person in the performance of the medical activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the term &ldquo;related health care entity&rdquo; shall mean an entity with which a medical practitioner has a professional affiliation under which the medical practitioner performs the medical activity, including but not limited to a nursing home, hospital, university, medical school, health maintenance organization, group medical practice, or a medical clinic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the term &ldquo;professional affiliation&rdquo; shall mean staff privileges, medical staff membership, employment or contractual relationship, partnership or ownership interest, academic appointment, or other affiliation under which a medical practitioner provides the medical activity on behalf of, or in association with, the health care entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the term &ldquo;body&rdquo; shall mean a human body, organ or cadaver, or a nonhuman animal used in medical research or instruction directly relating to the treatment of humans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the term &ldquo;patented use of a composition of matter&rdquo; does not include a claim for a method of performing a medical or surgical procedure on a body that recites the use of a composition of matter where the use of that composition of matter does not directly contribute to achievement of the objective of the claimed method.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; shall mean any state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#287_1_target" name="287_1">1</a></sup> or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection does not apply to the activities of any person, or employee or agent of such person (regardless of whether such person is a tax exempt organization under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code), who is engaged in the commercial development, manufacture, sale, <!-- PDFPage:86 -->importation, or distribution of a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or the provision of pharmacy or clinical laboratory services (other than clinical laboratory services provided in a physician's office), where such activities are:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) directly related to the commercial development, manufacture, sale, importation, or distribution of a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or the provision of pharmacy or clinical laboratory services (other than clinical laboratory services provided in a physician's office), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, or the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection shall not apply to any patent issued based on an application the earliest effective filing date of which is prior to September 30, 1996.</p>

In the absence of such a provision, the parties to an existing patent validity or infringement dispute may agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in equity for revocation of a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Arbitration of such disputes, awards by arbitrators and confirmation of awards shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In any such arbitration proceeding, the defenses provided for under section 282 of this title shall be considered by the arbitrator if raised by any party to the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An award by an arbitrator shall be final and binding between the parties to the arbitration but shall have no force or effect on any other person.

Any such modification shall govern the rights and obligations between such parties from the date of such modification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When an award is made by an arbitrator, the patentee, his assignee or licensee shall give notice thereof in writing to the Director. There shall be a separate notice prepared for each patent involved in such proceeding. Such notice shall set forth the names and addresses of the parties, the name of the inventor, and the name of the patent owner, shall designate the number of the patent, and shall contain a copy of the award. If an award is modified by a court, the party requesting such modification shall give notice of such modification to the Director.
