<p class="statutory-body">A person shall be entitled to a patent unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) he has abandoned the invention, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) the invention was first patented or caused to be patented, or was the subject of an inventor's certificate, by the applicant or his legal representatives or assigns in a foreign country prior to the date of the application for patent in this country on an application for patent or inventor's certificate filed more than twelve months before the filing of the application in the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) the invention was described in (1) an application for patent, published under section 122(b), by another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent or (2) a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent, except that an international application filed under the treaty defined in section 351(a) shall have the effects for the purposes of this subsection of an application filed in the United States only if the international application designated the United States and was published under Article 21(2) of such treaty in the English language;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#102_1_target" name="102_1">1</a></sup> or</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;31 (R.S. 4886, amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;1, 29 Stat. 692, (2) May 23, 1930, ch. 312, &sect;1, 46 Stat. 376, (3) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, &sect;1, 53 Stat. 1212).</p>
<p class="note-body">No change is made in these paragraphs other than that due to division into lettered paragraphs. The interpretation by the courts of paragraph (a) as being more restricted than the actual language would suggest (for example, &ldquo;known&rdquo; has been held to mean &ldquo;publicly known&rdquo;) is recognized but no change in the language is made at this time. Paragraph (a) together with section 104 contains the substance of Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;72 (R.S. 4923).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (d) is based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;32, first paragraph (R.S. 4887 (first paragraph), amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;3, 29 Stat. 692, 693, (2) Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1019, &sect;1, 32 Stat. 1225, 1226, (3) June 19, 1936, ch. 594, 49 Stat. 1529).</p>
<p class="note-body">The section has been changed so that the prior foreign patent is not a bar unless it was granted before the filing of the application in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (e) is new and enacts the rule of <em>Milburn</em> v. <em>Davis-Bournonville</em>, 270 U.S. 390, by reason of which a United States patent disclosing an invention dates from the date of filing the application for the purpose of anticipating a subsequent inventor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (f) indicates the necessity for the inventor as the party applying for patent. Subsequent sections permit certain persons to apply in place of the inventor under special circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (g) is derived from Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;69 (R.S. 4920, amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;2, 29 Stat. 692, (2) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, &sect;1, 53 Stat. 1212), the second defense recited in this section. This paragraph retains the present rules of law governing the determination of priority of invention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Language relating specifically to designs is omitted for inclusion in subsequent sections.</p>
