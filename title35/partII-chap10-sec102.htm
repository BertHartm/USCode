<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;31 (R.S. 4886, amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;1, 29 Stat. 692, (2) May 23, 1930, ch. 312, &sect;1, 46 Stat. 376, (3) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, &sect;1, 53 Stat. 1212).</p>
<p class="note-body">No change is made in these paragraphs other than that due to division into lettered paragraphs. The interpretation by the courts of paragraph (a) as being more restricted than the actual language would suggest (for example, &ldquo;known&rdquo; has been held to mean &ldquo;publicly known&rdquo;) is recognized but no change in the language is made at this time. Paragraph (a) together with section 104 contains the substance of Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;72 (R.S. 4923).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (d) is based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;32, first paragraph (R.S. 4887 (first paragraph), amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;3, 29 Stat. 692, 693, (2) Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1019, &sect;1, 32 Stat. 1225, 1226, (3) June 19, 1936, ch. 594, 49 Stat. 1529).</p>
<p class="note-body">The section has been changed so that the prior foreign patent is not a bar unless it was granted before the filing of the application in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (e) is new and enacts the rule of <em>Milburn</em> v. <em>Davis-Bournonville</em>, 270 U.S. 390, by reason of which a United States patent disclosing an invention dates from the date of filing the application for the purpose of anticipating a subsequent inventor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (f) indicates the necessity for the inventor as the party applying for patent. Subsequent sections permit certain persons to apply in place of the inventor under special circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (g) is derived from Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;69 (R.S. 4920, amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;2, 29 Stat. 692, (2) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, &sect;1, 53 Stat. 1212), the second defense recited in this section. This paragraph retains the present rules of law governing the determination of priority of invention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Language relating specifically to designs is omitted for inclusion in subsequent sections.</p>
