<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;1 (R.S. 475 and Executive Order 4175, Mar. 17, 1925).</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;all&rdquo; is omitted from the corresponding section of the existing statute and &ldquo;except as otherwise provided by law&rdquo; added, since some old records are kept in the National Archives, see 44 U.S.C., 1946 ed., ch. 8A.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;models&rdquo; has been omitted to remove emphasis on models since they are no longer generally required. They are included by the word &ldquo;things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;and to trade-mark registrations&rdquo; is added. There is no enactment corresponding to this section in the trade-mark law. The original chapter of the Revised Statutes containing this section deals with the Patent Office as such in its administration of trade-marks as well as patents. This is explicitly brought out in some of the corresponding sections of the present chapter. Changes in language are made.</p>
