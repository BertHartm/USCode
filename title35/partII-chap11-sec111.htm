<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1 [Claim and verified statement for benefit of earlier filing date; prior art; evidence of entitled filing date in any proceedings]. (a) A patent or trademark application shall be considered as having been filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the date that it would have been received by the Patent and Trademark Office except for the delay caused by the emergency situation affecting the postal service which began on March 18, 1970, and ended on or about March 30, 1970, if a claim is made for the benefit of an earlier date in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this section. Patents issued with earlier filing dates afforded by this section shall not be effective as prior art under subsection 102(e) of title 35 of the United States Code as of such earlier filing dates.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) No patent or trademark application, patent, or trademark registration shall be entitled to an earlier filing date under this section unless a verified statement by the applicant or owner of record claiming the filing date to which the application is believed to be entitled is filed in the Patent and Trademark Office within six months after enactment of this Act [June 30, 1971]. Such statement shall be maintained in the file of the application in the Patent and Trademark Office and shall be referred to in the patent or trademark registration when practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) When a statement filed under subsection (b) of this section appears unreasonable or defective on its face, or when the filing date of the patent or trademark application, patent, or trademark registration is called into question or is material in any inter partes proceeding in the Patent and Trademark Office or any proceeding in the courts, the applicant or owner of such application, patent, or trademark registration may be required to present evidence establishing the filing date to which the application is entitled.

Relief under this section must be requested by <!-- PDFPage:25 -->a verified statement filed in the Patent and Trademark Office by the patent or trademark applicant or owner within six months after enactment of this Act [June 30, 1971].</p>
