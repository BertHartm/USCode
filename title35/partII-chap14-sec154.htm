<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Every patent shall contain a short title of the invention and a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, of the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention throughout the United States or importing the invention into the United States, and, if the invention is a process, of the right to exclude others from using, offering for sale or selling throughout the United States, or importing into the United States, products made by that process, referring to the specification for the particulars thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Priority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Priority under section 119, 365(a), or 365(b) of this title shall not be taken into account in determining the term of a patent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Interference delay or secrecy orders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the issue of an original patent is delayed due to a proceeding under section 135(a) of this title, or because the application for patent is placed under an order pursuant to section 181 of this title, the term of the patent shall be extended for the period of delay, but in no case more than 5 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Extension for appellate review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the issue of a patent is delayed due to appellate review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or by a Federal court and the patent is issued pursuant to a decision in the review reversing an adverse determination of patentability, the term of the patent shall be extended for a period of time but in no case more than 5 years. A patent shall not be eligible for extension under this paragraph if it is subject to a terminal disclaimer due to the issue of another patent claiming subject matter that is not patentably distinct from that under appellate review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Continuation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term of a patent that is in force on or that results from an application filed before the date that is 6 months after the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act shall be the greater of the 20-year term as provided in subsection (a), or 17 years from grant, subject to any terminal disclaimers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The remedies of sections 283, 284, and 285 of this title shall not apply to acts which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) were commenced or for which substantial investment was made before the date that is 6 months after the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; and</p>
