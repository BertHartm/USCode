<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United States or imports into the United States a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following: (1) derived revenue from acts which if performed by another without his consent would constitute contributory infringement of the patent; (2) licensed or authorized another to perform acts which if performed without his consent would constitute contributory infringement of the patent; (3) sought to enforce his patent rights against infringement or contributory infringement; (4) refused to license or use any rights to the patent; or (5) conditioned the license of any rights to the patent or the sale of the patented product on the acquisition of a license to rights in another patent or purchase of a separate product, unless, in view <!-- PDFPage:107 -->of the circumstances, the patent owner has market power in the relevant market for the patent or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) It shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer to sell, or sell within the United States or import into the United States a patented invention (other than a new animal drug or veterinary biological product (as those terms are used in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Act of March 4, 1913) which is primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, hybridoma technology, or other processes involving site specific genetic manipulation techniques) solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs or veterinary biological products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It shall be an act of infringement to submit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or described in section 505(b)(2) of such Act for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) with respect to a patent that is identified in the list of patents described in section 351(<em>l</em>)(3) of the Public Health Service Act (including as provided under section 351(<em>l</em>)(7) of such Act), an application seeking approval of a biological product, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the applicant for the application fails to provide the application and information required under section 351(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) of such Act, an application seeking approval of a biological product for a patent that could be identified pursuant to section 351(<em>l</em>)(3)(A)(i) of such Act,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such Act to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of a drug, veterinary biological product, or biological product claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any action for patent infringement brought under this section, no injunctive or other relief may be granted which would prohibit the making, using, offering to sell, or selling within the United States or importing into the United States of a patented invention under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For an act of infringement described in paragraph (2)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the court shall order the effective date of any approval of the drug or veterinary biological product involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) injunctive relief may be granted against an infringer to prevent the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale within the United States or importation into the United States of an approved drug, veterinary biological product, or biological product,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) damages or other monetary relief may be awarded against an infringer only if there has been commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale within the United States or importation into the United States of an approved drug, veterinary biological product, or biological product, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the court shall order a permanent injunction prohibiting any infringement of the patent by the biological product involved in the infringement until a date which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent that has been infringed under paragraph (2)(C), provided the patent is the subject of a final court decision, as defined in section 351(k)(6) of the Public Health Service Act, in an action for infringement of the patent under section 351(<em>l</em>)(6) of such Act, and the biological product has not yet been approved because of section 351(k)(7) of such Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The remedies prescribed by subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) are the only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of infringement described in paragraph (2), except that a court may award attorney fees under section 285.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Where a person has filed an application described in paragraph (2) that includes a certification under subsection (b)(2)(A)(iv) or (j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), and neither the owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification nor the holder of the approved application under subsection (b) of such section for the drug that is claimed by the patent or a use of which is claimed by the patent brought an action for infringement of such patent before the expiration of 45 days after the date on which the notice given under subsection (b)(3) or (j)(2)(B) of such section was received, the courts of the United States shall, to the extent consistent with the Constitution, have subject matter jurisdiction in any action brought by such person under section 2201 of title 28 for a declaratory judgment that such patent is invalid or not infringed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Subparagraph (B) applies, in lieu of paragraph (4), in the case of a patent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that is identified, as applicable, in the list of patents described in section 351(<em>l</em>)(4) of the Public Health Service Act or the lists of patents described in section 351(<em>l</em>)(5)(B) of such Act with respect to a biological product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for which an action for infringement of the patent with respect to the biological product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) was brought after the expiration of the 30-day period described in subparagraph (A) or (B), as applicable, of section 351(<em>l</em>)(6) of such Act; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) was brought before the expiration of the 30-day period described in subclause (I), but which was dismissed without prejudice or was not prosecuted to judgment in good faith.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In an action for infringement of a patent described in subparagraph (A), the sole and ex<!-- PDFPage:108 -->clusive remedy that may be granted by a court, upon a finding that the making, using, offering to sell, selling, or importation into the United States of the biological product that is the subject of the action infringed the patent, shall be a reasonable royalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The owner of a patent that should have been included in the list described in section 351(<em>l</em>)(3)(A) of the Public Health Service Act, including as provided under section 351(<em>l</em>)(7) of such Act for a biological product, but was not timely included in such list, may not bring an action under this section for infringement of the patent with respect to the biological product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Whoever without authority imports into the United States or offers to sell, sells, or uses within the United States a product which is made by a process patented in the United States shall be liable as an infringer, if the importation, offer to sell, sale, or use of the product occurs during the term of such process patent. In an action for infringement of a process patent, no remedy may be granted for infringement on account of the noncommercial use or retail sale of a product unless there is no adequate remedy under this title for infringement on account of the importation or other use, offer to sell, or sale of that product. A product which is made by a patented process will, for purposes of this title, not be considered to be so made after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is materially changed by subsequent processes; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another product.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) As used in this section, the term &ldquo;whoever&rdquo; includes any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his official capacity. Any State, and any such instrumentality, officer, or employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this title in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) As used in this section, an &ldquo;offer for sale&rdquo; or an &ldquo;offer to sell&rdquo; by a person other than the patentee, or any designee of the patentee, is that in which the sale will occur before the expiration of the term of the patent.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first paragraph of this section is declaratory only, defining infringement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (b) and (c) define and limit contributory infringement of a patent and paragraph (d) is ancillary to these paragraphs, see preliminary general description of bill. One who actively induces infringement as by aiding and abetting the same is liable as an infringer, and so is one who sells a component part of a patented invention or material or apparatus for use therein knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in the infringement of the patent except in the case of a staple article or commodity of commerce having other uses. A patentee is not deemed to have misused his patent solely by reason of doing anything authorized by the section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such commercial use occurred at least 1 year before the earlier of either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the effective filing date of the claimed invention; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Premarketing regulatory review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject matter for which commercial marketing or use is subject to a premarketing regulatory review period during which the safety or efficacy of the subject matter is established, including any period specified in section 156(g), shall be deemed to be commercially used for purposes of subsection (a)(1) during such regulatory review period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Nonprofit laboratory use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A use of subject matter by a nonprofit research laboratory or other nonprofit entity, such as a university or hospital, for which the public is the intended beneficiary, shall be deemed to be a commercial use for purposes of subsection (a)(1), except that a defense under this section may be asserted pursuant to this paragraph only for continued and noncommercial use by and in the laboratory or other nonprofit entity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exhaustion of Rights</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (e)(1), the sale or other disposition of a useful end result by a person entitled to assert a defense under this section in connection with a patent with respect to that useful end result shall exhaust the patent owner's rights under the patent to the extent that such rights would have been exhausted had such sale or other disposition been made by the patent owner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations and Exceptions.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Personal defense.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of right</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except for any transfer to the patent owner, the right to assert a defense under this section shall not be licensed or assigned or transferred to another person except as an ancillary and subordinate part of a good-faith assignment or transfer for other reasons of the entire enterprise or line of business to which the defense relates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Restriction on sites</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A defense under this section, when acquired by a person as part of an assignment or transfer described in subparagraph (B), may only be asserted for uses at sites where the subject matter that would otherwise infringe a claimed invention is in use before the later of the effective filing date of the claimed invention or the date of the assignment or transfer of such enterprise or line of business.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Derivation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person may not assert a defense under this section if the subject matter on which the defense is based was derived from the patentee or persons in privity with the patentee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Not a general license</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The defense asserted by a person under this section is not a general license under all claims of the patent at issue, but extends only to the specific subject matter for which it has been established that a commercial use that qualifies under this section occurred, except that the defense shall also extend to variations in the quantity or volume of use of the claimed subject matter, and to improvements in the claimed subject matter that do not infringe additional specifically claimed subject matter of the patent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Abandonment of use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who has abandoned commercial use (that qualifies under this section) of subject matter may not rely on activities performed before the date of such abandonment in establishing a defense under this section with respect to actions taken on or after the date of such abandonment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person commercially using subject matter to which subsection (a) applies may not assert a defense under this section if the claimed invention with respect to which the defense is asserted was, at the time the invention was made, owned or subject to an obligation of assignment to either an institution of higher education (as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)),<sup><a href="#273_1_target" name="273_1">1</a></sup> or a technology transfer organization whose primary purpose is to facilitate the commercialization of technologies developed by one or more such institutions of higher education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if any of the activities required to reduce to practice the subject matter of the claimed invention could not have been undertaken using funds provided by the Federal Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:111 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Unreasonable Assertion of Defense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the defense under this section is pleaded by a person who is found to infringe the patent and who subsequently fails to demonstrate a reasonable basis for asserting the defense, the court shall find the case exceptional for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under section 285.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Invalidity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A patent shall not be deemed to be invalid under section 102 or 103 solely because a defense is raised or established under this section.</p>
