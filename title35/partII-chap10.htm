<p class="note-body">The corresponding section of existing statute is split into two sections, section 101 relating to the subject matter for which patents may be obtained, and section 102 defining statutory novelty and stating other conditions for patentability.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101 follows the wording of the existing statute as to the subject matter for patents, except that reference to plant patents has been omitted for incorporation in section 301 and the word &ldquo;art&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;process&rdquo;, which is defined in section 100. The word &ldquo;art&rdquo; in the corresponding section of the existing statute has a different meaning than the same word as used in other places in the statute; it has been interpreted by the courts as being practically synonymous with process or method. &ldquo;Process&rdquo; has been used as its meaning is more readily grasped than &ldquo;art&rdquo; as interpreted, and the definition in section 100(b) makes it clear that &ldquo;process or method&rdquo; is meant. The remainder of the definition clarifies the status of processes or methods which involve merely the new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material; they are processes or methods under the statute and may be patented provided the conditions for patentability are satisfied.</p>

<p class="note-body">Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;31 (R.S. 4886, amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;1, 29 Stat. 692, (2) May 23, 1930, ch. 312, &sect;1, 46 Stat. 376, (3) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, &sect;1, 53 Stat. 1212).</p>
<p class="note-body">No change is made in these paragraphs other than that due to division into lettered paragraphs. The interpretation by the courts of paragraph (a) as being more restricted than the actual language would suggest (for example, &ldquo;known&rdquo; has been held to mean &ldquo;publicly known&rdquo;) is recognized but no change in the language is made at this time. Paragraph (a) together with section 104 contains the substance of Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;72 (R.S. 4923).</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (d) is based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;32, first paragraph (R.S. 4887 (first paragraph), amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;3, 29 Stat. 692, 693, (2) Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1019, &sect;1, 32 Stat. 1225, 1226, (3) June 19, 1936, ch. 594, 49 Stat. 1529).</p>
<p class="note-body">The section has been changed so that the prior foreign patent is not a bar unless it was granted before the filing of the application in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (e) is new and enacts the rule of <em>Milburn</em> v. <em>Davis-Bournonville</em>, 270 U.S. 390, by reason of which a United States patent disclosing an invention dates from the date of filing the application for the purpose of anticipating a subsequent inventor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (f) indicates the necessity for the inventor as the party applying for patent. Subsequent sections permit certain persons to apply in place of the inventor under special circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (g) is derived from Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;69 (R.S. 4920, amended (1) Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 391, &sect;2, 29 Stat. 692, (2) Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 450, &sect;1, 53 Stat. 1212), the second defense recited in this section.

Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), and upon timely election by the applicant for patent to proceed under this subsection, a biotechnological process using or resulting in a composition of matter that is novel under section 102 and nonobvious under subsection (a) of this section shall be considered nonobvious if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">There is no provision corresponding to the first sentence explicitly stated in the present statutes, but the refusal of patents by the Patent Office, and the holding of patents invalid by the courts, on the ground of lack of invention or lack of patentable novelty has been followed since at least as early as 1850. This paragraph is added with the view that an explicit statement in the statute may have some stabilizing effect, and also to serve as a basis for the addition at a later time of some criteria which may be worked out.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence states that patentability as to this requirement is not to be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made, that is, it is immaterial whether it resulted from long toil and experimentation or from a flash of genius.</p>
