<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 97&ndash;291 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Without the cooperation of victims and witnesses, the criminal justice system would cease to function; yet with few exceptions these individuals are either ignored by the criminal justice system or simply used as tools to identify and punish offenders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) All too often the victim of a serious crime is forced to suffer physical, psychological, or financial hardship first as a result of the criminal act and then as a result of contact with a criminal justice system unresponsive to the real needs of such victim.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Although the majority of serious crimes falls under the jurisdiction of State and local law enforcement agencies, the Federal Government, and in particular the Attorney General, has an important leadership role to assume in ensuring that victims of crime, whether at the Federal, State, or local level, are given proper treatment by agencies administering the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Under current law, law enforcement agencies must have cooperation from a victim of crime and yet neither the agencies nor the legal system can offer adequate protection or assistance when the victim, as a result of such cooperation, is threatened or intimidated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) While the defendant is provided with counsel who can explain both the criminal justice process and the rights of the defendant, the victim or witness has no counterpart and is usually not even notified when the defendant is released on bail, the case is dismissed, a plea to a lesser charge is accepted, or a court date is changed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The victim and witness who cooperate with the prosecutor often find that the transportation, parking facilities, and child care services at the court are unsatisfactory and they must often share the pretrial waiting room with the defendant or his family and friends.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The victim may lose valuable property to a criminal only to lose it again for long periods of time to Federal law enforcement officials, until the trial and sometimes and [sic] appeals are over; many times that property is damaged or lost, which is particularly stressful for the elderly or poor.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Congress declares that the purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 1982 Amendment note set out under section 1501 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to ensure that the Federal Government does all that is possible within limits of available resources to assist victims and witnesses of crime without infringing on the constitutional rights of the defendant; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to provide a model for legislation for State and local governments.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Federal Guidelines for Treatment of Crime Victims and Witnesses in the Criminal Justice System</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of Pub. L. 97&ndash;291, as amended by Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, title II, &sect;1408(b), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2177, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) Within two hundred and seventy days after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 12, 1982], the Attorney General shall develop and implement guidelines for the Department of Justice consistent with the purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 1982 Amendment note set out under section 1501 of this title]. In preparing the guidelines the Attorney General shall consider the following objectives:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Services to victims of crime</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Law enforcement personnel should ensure that victims routinely receive emergency social and medical services as soon as possible and are given information on the following&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1514. Civil action to restrain harassment of a victim or witness</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A United States district court, upon application of the attorney for the Government, shall issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting harassment of a victim or witness in a Federal criminal case if the court finds, from specific facts shown by affidavit or by verified complaint, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that harassment of an identified victim or witness in a Federal criminal case exists or that such order is necessary to prevent and restrain an offense under section 1512 of this title, other than an offense consisting of misleading conduct, or under section 1513 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A temporary restraining order may be issued under this section without written or oral notice to the adverse party or such party's attorney in a civil action under this section if the court finds, upon written certification of facts by the attorney for the Government, that such notice should not be required and that there is a reasonable probability that the Government will prevail on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A temporary restraining order issued without notice under this section shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance and be filed forthwith in the office of the clerk of the court issuing the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A temporary restraining order issued under this section shall expire at such time, not to exceed 10 days from issuance, as the court directs; the court, for good cause shown before expiration of such order, may extend the expiration date of the order for up to 10 days or for such longer period agreed to by the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) When a temporary restraining order is issued without notice, the motion for a protective order shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character, and when such motion comes on for hearing, if the attorney for the Government does not proceed with the application for a protective order, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) If on two days notice to the attorney for the Government or on such shorter notice as the court may prescribe, the adverse party appears and moves to dissolve or modify the temporary restraining order, the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) A temporary restraining order shall set forth the reasons for the issuance of such order, be specific in terms, and describe in reasonable detail (and not by reference to the complaint or other document) the act or acts being restrained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A United States district court, upon motion of the attorney for the Government, shall issue a protective order prohibiting harassment of a victim or witness in a Federal criminal case if the court, after a hearing, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that harassment of an identified victim or witness in a Federal criminal case exists or that such order is necessary to prevent and restrain an offense under section 1512 of this title, other than an offense consisting of misleading conduct, or under section 1513 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At the hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, any adverse party named in the complaint shall have the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A protective order shall set forth the reasons for the issuance of such order, be specific in terms, describe in reasonable detail (and not by reference to the complaint or other document) the act or acts being restrained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The court shall set the duration of effect of the protective order for such period as the court determines necessary to prevent harassment of the victim or witness but in no case for a period in excess of three years from the date of such order's issuance. The attorney for the Government may, at any time within ninety days before the expiration of such order, apply for a new protective order under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; means a course of conduct directed at a specific person that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) causes substantial emotional distress in such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) serves no legitimate purpose; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;course of conduct&rdquo; means a series of acts over a period of time, however short, indicating a continuity of purpose.</p>
