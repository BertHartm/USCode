<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Defense of Insanity</cap-smallcap>. If a defendant intends to rely upon the defense of insanity at the time of the alleged offense, the defendant shall, within the time provided for the filing of pretrial motions or at such later time as the court may direct, notify the attorney for the government in writing of such intention and file a copy of such notice with the clerk. If there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this subdivision, insanity may not be raised as a defense. The court may for cause shown allow late filing of the notice or grant additional time to the parties to prepare for trial or make such other order as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Expert Testimony of Defendant's Mental Condition</cap-smallcap>. If a defendant intends to introduce expert testimony relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition of the defendant bearing upon the issue of guilt, the defendant shall, within the time provided for the filing of pretrial motions or at such later time as the court may direct, notify the attorney for the government in writing of such intention and file a copy of such notice with the clerk. The court may for cause shown allow late filing of the notice or grant additional time to <!-- PDFPage:57 -->the parties to prepare for trial or make such other order as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Mental Examination of Defendant</cap-smallcap>. In an appropriate case the court may, upon motion of the attorney for the government, order the defendant to submit to an examination pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4241 or 4242. No statement made by the defendant in the course of any examination provided for by this rule, whether the examination be with or without the consent of the defendant, no testimony by the expert based upon such statement, and no other fruits of the statement shall be admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue respecting mental condition on which the defendant has introduced testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Failure To Comply</cap-smallcap>. If there is a failure to give notice when required by subdivision (b) of this rule or to submit to an examination when ordered under subdivision (c) of this rule, the court may exclude the testimony of any expert witness offered by the defendant on the issue of the defendant's guilt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Inadmissibility of Withdrawn Intention</cap-smallcap>. Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under subdivision (a) or (b), later withdrawn, is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.2 is designed to require a defendant to give notice prior to trial of his intention (1) to rely upon the defense of insanity or (2) to introduce expert testimony of mental disease or defect on the theory that such mental condition is inconsistent with the mental state required for the offense charged. This rule does not deal with the issue of mental competency to stand trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The objective is to give the government time to prepare to meet the issue, which will usually require reliance upon expert testimony. Failure to give advance notice commonly results in the necessity for a continuance in the middle of a trial, thus unnecessarily delaying the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">A requirement that the defendant give notice of his intention to rely upon the defense of insanity was proposed by the Advisory Committee in the Second Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments (March 1964), rule 12.1, p. 7. The objective of the 1964 proposal was explained in a brief Advisory Committee Note:</p>
<p class="note-body">Under existing procedure although insanity is a defense, once it is raised the burden to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the government. <em>Davis v. United States</em>, 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895). This rule requires pretrial notice to the government of an insanity defense, thus permitting it to prepare to meet the issue. Furthermore, in <em>Lynch v. Overholser</em>, 369 U.S. 705, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962), the Supreme Court held that, at least in the face of a mandatory commitment statute, the defendant had a right to determine whether or not to raise the issue of insanity. The rule gives the defendant a method of raising the issue and precludes any problem of deciding whether or not the defendant relied on insanity.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure decided not to recommend the proposed Notice of Insanity rule to the Supreme Court. Reasons were not given.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring advance notice of the defense of insanity is commonly recommended as a desirable procedure. The Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, Vol. 1, p. 254 (1970), state in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">It is recommended that procedural reform provide for advance notice that evidence of mental disease or defect will be relied upon in defense.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring advance notice is proposed also by the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, &sect;4.03 (P.O.D. 1962). The commentary in Tentative Draft No. 4 at 193&ndash;194 (1955) indicates that, as of that time, six states required pretrial notice and an additional eight states required that the defense of insanity be specially pleaded.</p>
<p class="note-body">For recent state statutes see N.Y. CPL &sect;250.10 (McKinney's Consol. Laws, c. 11&ndash;A, 1971) enacted in 1970 which provides that no evidence by a defendant of a mental disease negativing criminal responsibility shall be allowed unless defendant has served notice on the prosecutor of his intention to rely upon such defense. See also New Jersey Penal Code (Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, Oct. 1971) &sect;2c: 4&ndash;3; New Jersey Court Rule 3:12; <em>State v. Whitlow</em>, 45 N.J. 3, 22 n. 3, 210 T.2d 763 (1965), holding the requirement of notice to be both appropriate and not in violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) deals with notice of the &ldquo;defense of insanity.&rdquo; In this context the term insanity has a well-understood meaning. See, e.g., Tydings, A Federal Verdict of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity and a Subsequent Commitment Procedure, 27 Md.L.Rev. 131 (1967). Precisely how the defense of insanity is phrased does, however, differ somewhat from circuit to circuit. See Study Draft of a New Federal Criminal Code, &sect;503 Comment at 37 (USGPO 1970). For a more extensive discussion of present law, see Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, Vol. 1, pp. 229&ndash;247 (USGPO 1970). The National Commission recommends the adoption of a single test patterned after the proposal of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code. The proposed definition provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">In any prosecution for an offense lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect is a defense. [Study Draft of a New Federal Criminal Code &sect;503 at 36&ndash;37.]</p>
<p class="note-body">Should the proposal of the National Commission be adopted by the Congress, the language of subdivision (a) probably ought to be changed to read &ldquo;defense of lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;defense of insanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is intended to deal with the issue of expert testimony bearing upon the issue of whether the defendant had the &ldquo;mental state required for the offense charged.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">There is some disagreement as to whether it is proper to introduce evidence of mental disease or defect bearing not upon the defense of insanity, but rather upon the existence of the mental state required by the offense charged. The American Law Institute's Model Penal Code takes the position that such evidence is admissible [&sect;4.02(1) (P.O.D. 1962)]. See also <em>People v. Gorshen</em>, 51 Cal.2d 716, 336 P.2d 492 (1959).</p>
<p class="note-body">The federal cases reach conflicting conclusions. See <em>Rhodes v. United States</em>, 282 F.2d 59, 62 (4th Cir. 1960):</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The proper way would have been to ask the witness to describe the defendant's mental condition and symptoms, his pathological beliefs and motivations, if he was thus afflicted, and to explain how these influenced or could have influenced his behavior, particularly his mental capacity knowingly to make the false statement charged, or knowingly to forge the signatures .</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Compare <em>Fisher v. United States</em>, 328 U.S. 463, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382 (1946).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) does not attempt to decide when expert testimony is admissible on the issue of the requisite mental state. It provides only that the defendant must give pretrial notice when he intends to introduce <!-- PDFPage:58 -->such evidence. The purpose is to prevent the need for a continuance when such evidence is offered without prior notice. The problem of unnecessary delay has arisen in jurisdictions which do not require prior notice of an intention to use expert testimony on the issue of mental state. Referring to this, the California Special Commission on Insanity and Criminal Offenders, First Report 30 (1962) said:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The abuses of the present system are great. Under a plea of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; without any notice to the people that the defense of insanity will be relied upon, defendant has been able to raise the defense upon the trial of the issue as to whether he committed the offense charged.</p>
<p class="note-body">As an example of the delay occasioned by the failure to heretofore require a pretrial notice by the defendant, see <em>United States v. Albright</em>, 388 F.2d 719 (4th Cir. 1968), where a jury trial was recessed for 23 days to permit a psychiatric examination by the prosecution when the defendant injected a surprise defense of lack of mental competency.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) gives the court the authority to order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by a psychiatrist designated by the court. A similar provision is found in ALI, Model Penal Code &sect;4.05(1) (P.O.D. 1962). This is a common provision of state law, the constitutionality of which has been sustained. Authorities are collected in ALI, Model Penal Code, pp. 195&ndash;196 Tent. Draft No. 4, (1955). For a recent proposal, see the New Jersey Penal Code &sect;2c: 4&ndash;5 (Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, Oct. 1971) authorizing appointment of &ldquo;at least one qualified psychiatrist to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant.&rdquo; Any issue of self-incrimination which might arise can be dealt with by the court as, for example, by a bifurcated trial which deals separately with the issues of guilt and of mental responsibility. For statutory authority to appoint a psychiatrist with respect to competency to stand trial, see 18 U.S.C. &sect;4244.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) confers authority on the court to exclude expert testimony in behalf of a defendant who has failed to give notice under subdivision (b) or who refuses to be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist under subdivision (c). See <em>State v. Whitlow</em>, 45 N.J. 3, 23, 210 A.2d 763 (1965), which indicates that it is proper to limit or exclude testimony by a defense psychiatrist whenever defendant refuses to be examined.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 12.2 is a new rule that deals with defense based upon mental condition. It provides that: (1) The defendant must notify the prosecution in writing of his intention to rely upon the defense of insanity. If the defendant fails to comply, &ldquo;insanity may not be raised as a defense.&rdquo; (2) If the defendant intends to introduce expert testimony relating to mental disease or defect on the issue whether he had the requisite mental state, he must notify the prosecution in writing. (3) The court, on motion of the prosecution, may order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by a court-appointed psychiatrist. (4) If the defendant fails to undergo the court-ordered psychiatric examination, the court may exclude any expert witness the defendant offers on the issue of his mental state.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee agrees with the proposed rule but has added language concerning the use of statements made to a psychiatrist during the course of a psychiatric examination provided for by Rule 12.2. The language provides:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">No statement made by the accused in the course of any examination provided for by this rule, whether the examination shall be with or without the consent of the accused, shall be admitted in evidence against the accused before the judge who or jury which determines the guilt of the accused, prior to the determination of guilt.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The purpose of this rule is to secure the defendant's fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. See <em>State v. Raskin</em>, 34 Wis.2d 607, 150 N.W.2d 318 (1967). The provision is flexible and does not totally preclude the use of such statements. For example, the defendant's statement can be used at a separate determination of the issue of sanity or for sentencing purposes once guilt has been determined. A limiting instruction to the jury in a single trial to consider statements made to the psychiatrist only on the issue of sanity would not satisfy the requirements of the rule as amended. The prejudicial effect on the determination of guilt would be inescapable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee notes that the rule does not attempt to resolve the issue whether the court can constitutionally compel a defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination when the defendant is unwilling to undergo one. The provisions of subdivision (c) are qualified by the phrase, &ldquo;In an appropriate case.&rdquo; If the court cannot constitutionally compel an unwilling defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination, then the provisions of subdivision (c) are inapplicable in every instance where the defendant is unwilling to undergo a court-ordered psychiatric examination. The Committee, by its approval of subdivision (c), intends to take no stand whatever on the constitutional question.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Conference Committee Notes, House Report No. 94&ndash;414; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.2(c) deals with court-ordered psychiatric examinations. The House version provides that no statement made by a defendant during a court-ordered psychiatric examination could be admitted in evidence against the defendant before the trier of fact that determines the issue of guilt prior to the determination of guilt. The Senate version deletes this provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts a modified House provision and restores to the bill the language of H.R. 6799 as it was originally introduced. The Conference adopted language provides that no statement made by the defendant during a psychiatric examination provided for by the rule shall be admitted against him on the issue of guilt in any criminal proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference believes that the provision in H.R. 6799 as originally introduced in the House adequately protects the defendant's fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. The rule does not preclude use of statements made by a defendant during a court-ordered psychiatric examination. The statements may be relevant to the issue of defendant's sanity and admissible on that issue. However, a limiting instruction would not satisfy the rule if a statement is so prejudicial that a limiting instruction would be ineffective. Cf. practice under 18 U.S.C. 4244.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). Courts have recently experienced difficulty with the question of what kind of expert testimony offered for what purpose falls within the notice requirement of rule 12.2(b). See, e.g., <em>United States v. Hill</em>, 655 F.2d 512 (3d Cir. 1980) (rule not applicable to tendered testimony of psychologist concerning defendant's susceptibility of inducement, offered to reinforce defendant's entrapment defense); <em>United States v. Webb</em>, 625 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. 1980) (rule not applicable to expert testimony tendered to show that defendant lacked the &ldquo;propensity to commit a violent act,&rdquo; as this testimony was offered &ldquo;to prove that Webb did not commit the offense charged,&rdquo; shooting at a helicopter, &ldquo;not that certain conduct was unaccompanied by criminal intent&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Perl</em>, 584 F.2d 1316 (4th Cir. 1978) (because entrapment defense properly withheld from jury, it was unnecessary to decide if the district court erred in holding rule applicable to tendered testimony of the doctor that defendant had increased susceptibility to suggestion as a result of medication he was taking); <em>United States v. Olson</em>, 576 F.2d 1267 (8th Cir. 1978) (rule applicable to tendered testimony of an alcoholism and drug therapist that defendant was not responsible for his actions because of a problem with <!-- PDFPage:59 -->alcohol); <em>United States v. Staggs</em>, 553 F.2d 1073 (7th Cir. 1977) (rule applicable to tendered testimony of psychologist that defendant, charged with assaulting federal officer, was more likely to hurt himself than to direct his aggressions toward others, as this testimony bears upon whether defendant intended to put victim in apprehension when he picked up the gun).</p>
<p class="note-body">What these cases illustate is that expert testimony about defendant's mental condition may be tendered in a wide variety of circumstances well beyond the situation clearly within rule 12.2(b), i.e., where a psychiatrist testifies for the defendant regarding his diminished capacity. In all of these situations and others like them, there is good reason to make applicable the notice provisions of rule 12.2(b). This is because in all circumstances in which the defendant plans to offer expert testimony concerning his mental condition at the time of the crime charged, advance disclosure to the government will serve &ldquo;to permit adequate pretrial preparation, to prevent surprise at trial, and to avoid the necessity of delays during trial.&rdquo; 2 <em>A.B.A. Standards for Criminal Justice</em> 11&ndash;55 (2d 1980). Thus, while the district court in <em>United States v. Hill</em>, 481 F.Supp. 558 (E.D.Pa. 1979), incorrectly concluded that present rule 12.2(b) covers testimony by a psychologist bearing on the defense of entrapment, the court quite properly concluded that the government would be seriously disadvantaged by lack of notice. This would have meant that the government would not have been equipped to cross-examine the expert, that any expert called by the government would not have had an opportunity to hear the defense expert testify, and that the government would not have had an opportunity to conduct the kind of investigation needed to acquire rebuttal testimony on defendant's claim that he was especially susceptible to inducement. Consequently, rule 12.2(b) has been expanded to cover all of the aforementioned situations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). The amendment of the first sentence of subdivision (c), recognizing that the government may seek to have defendant subjected to a mental examination by an expert other than a psychiatrist, is prompted by the same considerations discussed above. Because it is possible that the defendant will submit to examination by an expert of his own other than a psychiatrist, it is necessary to recognize that it will sometimes be appropriate for defendant to be examined by a government expert other than a psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (c) has been amended to more accurately reflect the Fifth Amendment considerations at play in this context. See <em>Estelle v. Smith</em>, 451 U.S. 454 (1981), holding that self-incrimination protections are not inevitably limited to the guilt phase of a trial and that the privilege, when applicable, protects against use of defendant's statement and also the fruits thereof, including expert testimony based upon defendant's statements to the expert. <em>Estelle</em> also intimates that &ldquo;a defendant can be required to submit to a sanity examination,&rdquo; and presumably some other form of mental examination, when &ldquo;his silence may deprive the State of the only effective means it has of controverting his proof on an issue that he interjected into the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). The broader term &ldquo;mental condition&rdquo; is appropriate here in light of the above changes to subdivisions (b) and (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). New subdivision (e), generally consistent with the protection afforded in rule 12.1(f) with respect to notice of alibi, ensures that the notice required under subdivision (b) will not deprive the defendant of an opportunity later to elect not to utilize any expert testimony. This provision is consistent with <em>Williams v. Florida</em>, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), holding the privilege against self-incrimination is not violated by requiring the defendant to give notice of a defense where the defendant retains the &ldquo;unfettered choice&rdquo; of abandoning the defense.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Dissenting Statement of Justice O'Connor to 1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">With one minor reservation, I join the Court in its adoption of the proposed amendments. They represent the product of considerable effort by the Advisory Committee, and they will institute desirable reforms. My sole disagreement with the Court's action today lies in its failure to recommend correction of an apparent error in the drafting of Proposed Rule 12.2(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">As proposed, Rule 12.2(e) reads:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under subdivision (a) or (b), later withdrawn, is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who gave notice of the intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Identical language formerly appeared in Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 11(e)(6) and Fed. Rules Evid. 410, each of which stated that</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;[Certain material] is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the defendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Those rules were amended, Supreme Court Order April 30, 1979, 441 U.S. 970, 987, 1007, Pub. Law 96&ndash;42, approved July 31, 1979, 93 Stat. 326. After the amendments, the relevant language read,</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;[Certain material] is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">As the Advisory Committee explained, this minor change was necessary to eliminate an ambiguity. Before the amendment, the word &ldquo;against&rdquo; could be read as referring either to the kind of proceeding in which the evidence was offered or to the purpose for which it was offered. Thus, for instance, if a person was a witness in a suit but not a party, it was unclear whether the evidence could be used to impeach him. In such a case, the <em>use</em> would be against the person, but the <em>proceeding</em> would not be against him. Similarly, if the person wished to introduce the evidence in a proceeding in which he was the defendant, the use, but not the proceeding, would be against him. To eliminate the ambiguity, the Advisory Committee proposed the amendment clarifying that the evidence was inadmissible against the person, regardless of whether the particular proceeding was against the person. See Adv. Comm. Note to Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 11(e)(6); Adv. Comm. Note to Fed. Rules Evid. 410.</p>
<p class="note-body">The same ambiguity inheres in the proposed version of Rule 12.2(e). We should recommend that it be eliminated now. To that extent, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). This clarifying amendment is intended to serve the same purpose as a comparable change made in 1979 to similar language in Rule 11(e)(6). The change makes it clear that evidence of a withdrawn intent is thereafter inadmissible against the person who gave the notice in any civil or criminal proceeding, without regard to whether the proceeding is against that person.</p>
