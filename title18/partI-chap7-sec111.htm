<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;118, 254 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;62, 35 Stat. 1100; May 18, 1934, ch. 299, &sect;2, 48 Stat. 781).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates sections 118 and 254 with changes in phraseology and substance necessary to effect the consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also the words &ldquo;Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture&rdquo; appearing in section 118 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were inserted in enumeration of Federal officers and employees in section 1114 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provision of section 254 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was adopted as the latest expression of Congressional intent. This consolidation eliminates a serious incongruity in punishment and application.</p>
