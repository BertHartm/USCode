<p class="note-body">This section consolidates sections 118 and 254 with changes in phraseology and substance necessary to effect the consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also the words &ldquo;Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture&rdquo; appearing in section 118 of <!-- PDFPage:27 -->title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were inserted in enumeration of Federal officers and employees in section 1114 of this title.</p>
