<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;201 (July 11, 1919, ch. 6, &sect;6, 41 Stat. 68).</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; was added in three instances after the words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; to remove doubt as to the scope of the section. (See definitions of &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to the offense as a misdemeanor was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitive section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;on conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage since punishment can be imposed only after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
