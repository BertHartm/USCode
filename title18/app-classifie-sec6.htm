<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Motion for Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within the time specified by the court for the filing of a motion under this section, the United States may request the court to conduct a hearing to make all determinations concerning the use, relevance, or admissibility of classified information that would otherwise be made during the trial or pretrial proceeding. Upon such a request, the court shall conduct such a hearing. Any hearing held pursuant to this subsection (or any portion of such hearing specified in the request of the Attorney General) shall be held in camera if the Attorney General certifies to the court in such petition that a public proceeding may result in the disclosure of classified information. As to each item of classified information, the court shall set forth in writing the basis for its determination. Where the United States&rsquo; motion under this subsection is filed prior to the trial or pretrial proceeding, the court shall rule prior to the commencement of the relevant proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Before any hearing is conducted pursuant to a request by the United States under subsection (a), the United States shall provide the defendant with notice of the classified information that is at issue. Such notice shall identify the specific classified information at issue whenever that information previously has been made available to the defendant by the United States. When the United States has not previously made the information available to the defendant in connection with the case, the information may be described by generic category, in such forms as the court may approve, rather than by identification of the specific information of concern to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the United States requests a hearing under subsection (a), the court, upon request of the defendant, may order the United States to provide the defendant, prior to trial, such details as to the portion of the indictment or information at issue in the hearing as are needed to give the defendant fair notice to prepare for the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Procedure for Disclosure of Classified Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Upon any determination by the court authorizing the disclosure of specific classified information under the procedures established by this section, the United States may move that, in lieu of the disclosure of such specific classified information, the court order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the substitution for such classified information of a statement admitting relevant facts that the specific classified information would tend to prove; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the substitution for such classified information of a summary of the specific classified information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The court shall grant such a motion of the United States if it finds that the statement or summary will provide the defendant with substantially the same ability to make his defense as would disclosure of the specific classified information. The court shall hold a hearing on any motion under this section. Any such hearing shall be held in camera at the request of the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The United States may, in connection with a motion under paragraph (1), submit to the court an affidavit of the Attorney General certifying that disclosure of classified information would cause identifiable damage to the national security of the United States and explaining the basis for the classification of such information. If so requested by the United States, the court shall examine such affidavit in camera and ex parte.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Sealing of Records of In Camera Hearings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the close of an in camera hearing under this Act (or any portion of a hearing under this Act that is held in camera) the court determines that the classified information at issue may not be disclosed or elicited at the trial or pretrial proceeding, the record of such in camera hearing shall be sealed and preserved by the court for use in the event of an appeal. The defendant may seek reconsideration of the court's determination prior to or during trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition on Disclosure of Classified Information by Defendant, Relief for Defendant When United States Opposes Disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Whenever the court denies a motion by the United States that it issue an order under subsection (c) and the United States files with the court an affidavit of the Attorney General objecting to disclosure of the classified information at issue, the court shall order that the defendant not disclose or cause the disclosure of such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a defendant is prevented by an order under paragraph (1) from disclosing or causing the disclosure of classified information, the court shall dismiss the indictment or information; except that, when the court determines that the interests of justice would not be served by dismissal of the indictment or information, the court shall order such other action, in lieu of dismissing the indictment or information, as the court determines is appropriate. Such action may include, but need not be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) dismissing specified counts of the indictment or information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finding against the United States on any issue as to which the excluded classified information relates; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) striking or precluding all or part of the testimony of a witness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An order under this paragraph shall not take effect until the court has afforded the United States an opportunity to appeal such order under section 7, and thereafter to withdraw its objection to the disclosure of the classified information at issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reciprocity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the court determines pursuant to subsection (a) that classified information may be disclosed in connection with a trial or pretrial proceeding, the court shall, unless the interests of fairness do not so require, order the United States to provide the defendant <!-- PDFPage:8 -->with the information it expects to use to rebut the classified information. The court may place the United States under a continuing duty to disclose such rebuttal information. If the United States fails to comply with its obligation under this subsection, the court may exclude any evidence not made the subject of a required disclosure and may prohibit the examination by the United States of any witness with respect to such information.</p>
