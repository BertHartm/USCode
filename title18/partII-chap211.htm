<p class="note-body">Section was completely rewritten to clarify legislative intent and in order to omit special venue provisions from many sections.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;committed in more than one district&rdquo; may be comprehensive enough to include &ldquo;begun in one district and completed in another&rdquo;, but the use of both expressions precludes any doubt as to legislative intent.</p>

<p class="note-body">The last paragraph of the revised section was added to meet the situation created by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 1944, 65 S. Ct. 249, 89 L. Ed. 236, which turned on the absence of a special venue provision in the Dentures Act, section 1821 of this revision. The revised section removes all doubt as to the venue of continuing offenses and makes unnecessary special venue provisions except in cases where Congress desires to restrict the prosecution of offenses to particular districts as in section 1073 of this revision.</p>
