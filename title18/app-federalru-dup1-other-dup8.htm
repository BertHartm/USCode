<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Required.</strong> Unless this rule, Rule 5, or Rule 10 provides otherwise, the defendant must be present at:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the initial appearance, the initial arraignment, and the plea;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) every trial stage, including jury impanelment and the return of the verdict; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sentencing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) When Not Required.</strong> A defendant need not be present under any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>Organizational Defendant.</em></strong> The defendant is an organization represented by counsel who is present.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Misdemeanor Offense.</em></strong> The offense is punishable by fine or by imprisonment for not <!-- PDFPage:148 -->more than one year, or both, and with the defendant's written consent, the court permits arraignment, plea, trial, and sentencing to occur in the defendant's absence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Conference or Hearing on a Legal Question. </em></strong>The proceeding involves only a conference or hearing on a question of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) <em>Sentence Correction.</em></strong> The proceeding involves the correction or reduction of sentence under Rule 35 or 18 U.S.C. &sect;3582(c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Waiving Continued Presence.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> A defendant who was initially present at trial, or who had pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, waives the right to be present under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) when the defendant is voluntarily absent after the trial has begun, regardless of whether the court informed the defendant of an obligation to remain during trial;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in a noncapital case, when the defendant is voluntarily absent during sentencing; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) when the court warns the defendant that it will remove the defendant from the courtroom for disruptive behavior, but the defendant persists in conduct that justifies removal from the courtroom.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. The first sentence of the rule setting forth the necessity of the defendant's presence at arraignment and trial is a restatement of existing law, <em>Lewis v. United States</em>, 146 U.S. 370; <em>Diaz v. United States</em>, 223 U.S. 442, 455. This principle does not apply to hearings on motions made prior to or after trial, <em>United States v. Lynch</em>, 132 F.2d 111 (C.C.A. 3d).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The second sentence of the rule is a restatement of existing law that, except in capital cases, the defendant may not defeat the proceedings by voluntarily absenting himself after the trial has been commenced in his presence, <em>Diaz v. United States</em>, 223 U.S. 442, 455; <em>United States v. Noble</em>, 294 F. 689 (D.Mont.)&mdash;affirmed, 300 F. 689 (C.C.A. 9th); <em>United States v. Barracota</em>, 45 F.Supp. 38 (S.D.N.Y.); <em>United States v. Vassalo</em>, 52 F.2d 699 (E.D.Mich.).</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The fourth sentence of the rule empowering the court in its discretion, with the defendant's written consent, to conduct proceedings in misdemeanor cases in defendant's absence adopts a practice prevailing in some districts comprising very large areas. In such districts appearance in court may require considerable travel, resulting in expense and hardship not commensurate with the gravity of the charge, if a minor infraction is involved and a small fine is eventually imposed. The rule, which is in the interest of defendants in such situations, leaves it discretionary with the court to permit defendants in misdemeanor cases to absent themselves and, if so, to determine in what types of misdemeanors and to what extent. Similar provisions are found in the statutes of a number of States. See A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure, pp. 881&ndash;882.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The purpose of the last sentence of the rule is to resolve a doubt that at times has arisen as to whether it is necessary to bring the defendant to court from an institution in which he is confined, possibly at a distant point, if the court determines to reduce the sentence previously imposed. It seems in the interest of both the Government and the defendant not to require such presence, because of the delay and expense that are involved.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The revision of rule 43 is designed to reflect <em>Illinois v. Allen</em>, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed. 2d 353 (1970). In <em>Allen</em>, the court held that &ldquo;there are at least three constitutionally permissible ways for a trial judge to handle an obstreperous defendant like Allen: (1) bind and gag him, thereby keeping him present; (2) cite him for contempt; (3) take him out of the courtroom until he promises to conduct himself properly.&rdquo; 397 U.S. at 343&ndash;344, 90 S.Ct. 1057.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since rule 43 formerly limited trial in absentia to situations in which there is a &ldquo;voluntary absence after the trial has been commenced,&rdquo; it could be read as precluding a federal judge from exercising the third option held to be constitutionally permissible in <em>Allen</em>. The amendment is designed to make clear that the judge does have the power to exclude the defendant from the courtroom when the circumstances warrant such action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The decision in <em>Allen</em>, makes no attempt to spell out standards to guide a judge in selecting the appropriate method to ensure decorum in the courtroom and there is no attempt to do so in the revision of the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan stresses that the trial judge should make a reasonable effort to enable an excluded defendant &ldquo;to communicate with his attorney and, if possible, to keep apprised of the progress of the trial.&rdquo; 397 U.S. at 351, 90 S.Ct. 1057. The Federal Judicial Center is presently engaged in experimenting with closed circuit television in courtrooms. The experience gained from these experiments may make closed circuit television readily available in federal courtrooms through which an excluded defendant would be able to hear and observe the trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The defendant's right to be present during the trial on a capital offense has been said to be so fundamental that it may not be waived. <em>Diaz v. United States</em>, 223 U.S. 442, 455, 32 S.Ct. 250, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912) (dictum); <em>Near v. Cunningham</em>, 313 F.2d 929, 931 (4th Cir. 1963); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;723 at 199 (1969, Supp.1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">However, in <em>Illinois v. Allen, supra</em> the court's opinion suggests that sanctions such as contempt may be least effective where the defendant is ultimately facing a far more serious sanction such as the death penalty. 397 U.S. at 345, 90 S.Ct. 1057. The ultimate determination of when a defendant can waive his right to be present in a capital case (assuming a death penalty provision is held constitutional, see <em>Furman v. Georgia</em>, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972)) is left for further clarification by the courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1) makes clear that voluntary absence may constitute a waiver even if the defendant has not been informed by the court of his obligation to remain during the trial. Of course, proof of voluntary absence will require a showing that the defendant knew of the fact that the trial or other proceeding was going on. C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;723 n. 35 (1969). But it is unnecessary to show that he was specifically warned of his obligation to be present; a warning seldom is thought necessary in current practice. [See <em>Taylor v. United States</em>, 414 U.S. 17, 94 S.Ct. 194, 38 L.Ed.2d 174 (1973).]</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(3) makes clear that the defendant need not be present at a conference held by the court and counsel where the subject of the conference is an issue of law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other changes in the rule are editorial in nature. In the last phrase of the first sentence, &ldquo;these rules&rdquo; is changed to read &ldquo;this rule,&rdquo; because there are no references in any of the other rules to situations where <!-- PDFPage:149 -->the defendant is not required to be present. The phrase &ldquo;at the time of the plea,&rdquo; is added to subdivision (a) to make perfectly clear that defendant must be present at the time of the plea. See rule 11(c)(5) which provides that the judge may set a time, other than arraignment, for the holding of a plea agreement procedure.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with the presence of the defendant during the proceedings against him. It presently permits a defendant to be tried in absentia only in non-capital cases where the defendant has voluntarily absented himself after the trial has begun.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court amendments provide that a defendant has waived his right to be present at the trial of a capital or noncapital case in two circumstances: (1) when he voluntarily absents himself after the trial has begun; and (2) where he &ldquo;engages in conduct which is such as to justify his being excluded from the courtroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee added language to subdivision (b)(2), which deals with excluding a disruptive defendant from the courtroom. The Advisory Committee Note indicates that the rule proposed by the Supreme Court was drafted to reflect the decision in <em>Illinois v. Allen</em>, 397 U.S. 337 (1970). The Committee found that subdivision (b)(2) as proposed did not full track the <em>Allen</em> decision. Consequently, language was added to that subsection to require the court to warn a disruptive defendant before excluding him from the courtroom.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The revisions to Rule 43 focus on two areas. First, the amendments make clear that a defendant who, initially present at trial or who has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, but who voluntarily flees before sentencing, may nonetheless be sentenced in absentia. Second, the rule is amended to extend to organizational defendants. In addition, some stylistic changes have been made.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The changes to subdivision (a) are stylistic in nature and the Committee intends no substantive change in the operation of that provision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. The changes in subdivision (b) are intended to remedy the situation where a defendant voluntarily flees before sentence is imposed. Without the amendment, it is doubtful that a court could sentence a defendant who had been present during the entire trial but flees before sentencing. Delay in conducting the sentencing hearing under such circumstances may result in difficulty later in gathering and presenting the evidence necessary to formulate a guideline sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The right to be present at court, although important, is not absolute. The caselaw, and practice in many jurisdictions, supports the proposition that the right to be present at trial may be waived through, inter alia, the act of fleeing. See <em>generally Crosby v. United States</em>, 113 S.Ct. 748, 506 U.S. 255 (1993). The amendment extends only to noncapital cases and applies only where the defendant is voluntarily absent after the trial has commenced or where the defendant has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. The Committee envisions that defense counsel will continue to represent the interests of the defendant at sentencing.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;at trial, or having pleaded guilty or nolo contendere&rdquo; have been added at the end of the first sentence to make clear that the trial of an absent defendant is possible only if the defendant was previously present at the trial or has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. See <em>Crosby v. United States, supra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. The change to subdivision (c) is technical in nature and replaces the word &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; with a reference to &ldquo;organization,&rdquo; as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect;18 to include entities other than corporations.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 43(c)(4) is intended to address two issues. First, the rule is rewritten to clarify whether a defendant is entitled to be present at resentencing proceedings conducted under Rule 35. As a result of amendments over the last several years to Rule 35, implementation of the Sentencing Reform Act, and caselaw interpretations of Rules 35 and 43, questions had been raised whether the defendant had to be present at those proceedings. Under the present version of the rule, it could be possible to require the defendant's presence at a &ldquo;reduction&rdquo; of sentence hearing conducted under Rule 35(b), but not a &ldquo;correction&rdquo; of sentence hearing conducted under Rule 35(a). That potential result seemed at odds with sound practice. As amended, Rule 43(c)(4) would permit a court to reduce or correct a sentence under Rule 35(b) or (c), respectively, without the defendant being present. But a sentencing proceeding being conducted on remand by an appellate court under Rule 35(a) would continue to require the defendant's presence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Moree</em>, 928 F.2d 654, 655&ndash;656 (5th Cir. 1991) (noting distinction between presence of defendant at modification of sentencing proceedings and those hearings that impose new sentence after original sentence has been set aside).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second issue addressed by the amendment is the applicability of Rule 43 to resentencing hearings conducted under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3582(c). Under that provision, a resentencing may be conducted as a result of retroactive changes to the Sentencing Guidelines by the United States Sentencing Commission or as a result of a motion by the Bureau of Prisons to reduce a sentence based on &ldquo;extraordinary and compelling reasons.&rdquo; The amendment provides that a defendant's presence is not required at such proceedings. In the Committee's view, those proceedings are analogous to Rule 35(b) as it read before the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, where the defendant's presence was not required. Further, the court may only reduce the original sentence under these proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 43 After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Committee made no changes to the draft amendment as published.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 43 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first substantive change is reflected in Rule 43(a), which recognizes several exceptions to the requirement that a defendant must be present in court for all proceedings. In addition to referring to exceptions that might exist in Rule 43 itself, the amendment recognizes that a defendant need not be present when the court has permitted video teleconferencing procedures under Rules 5 and 10 or when the defendant has waived the right to be present for the arraignment under Rule 10. Second, by inserting the word &ldquo;initial&rdquo; before &ldquo;arraignment,&rdquo; revised Rule 43(a)(1) reflects the view that a defendant need not be present for subsequent arraignments based upon a superseding indictment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Rule has been reorganized to make it easier to read and apply; revised Rule 43(b) is former Rule 43(c).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. This rule is a restatement of existing law in regard to the defendant's constitutional right of counsel as defined in recent judicial decisions. The Sixth Amendment provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">28 U.S.C. former &sect;394 (now &sect;1654) provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In all the courts of the United States the parties may plead and manage their own causes personally, or by the assistance of such counsel or attorneys at law as, by the rules of the said courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">18 U.S.C. former &sect;563 (now &sect;3005), which is derived from the act of April 30, 1790 (1 Stat. 118), provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Every person who is indicted of treason or other capital crime, shall be allowed to make his full defense by counsel learned in the law; and the court before which he is tried or some judge thereof, shall immediately, upon his request, assign to him such counsel, not exceeding two, as he may desire, and they shall have free access to him at all seasonable hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The present extent of the right of counsel has been defined recently in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst</em>, 304 U.S. 458; <em>Walker v. Johnston</em>, 312 U.S. 275; and <em>Glasser v. United States</em>, 315 U.S. 60. The rule is a restatement of the principles enunciated in these decisions. See, also, Holtzoff, 20 N.Y.U.L.Q.R. 1.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule is intended to indicate that the right of the defendant to have counsel assigned by the court relates only to proceedings in court and, therefore, does not include preliminary proceedings before a committing magistrate. Although the defendant is not entitled to have counsel assigned to him in connection with preliminary proceedings, he is entitled to be represented by counsel retained by him, if he so chooses, Rule 5(b) (Proceedings before the Commissioner; Statement by the Commissioner) and Rule 40(b)(2) (Commitment to Another District; Removal&mdash;Arrest in Distant District&mdash;Statement by Commissioner or Judge). As to defendant's right of counsel in connection with the taking of depositions, see Rule 15(c) (Depositions&mdash;Defendant's Counsel and Payment of Expenses).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A new rule is provided as a substitute for the old to provide for the assignment of counsel to defendants unable to obtain counsel during all stages of the proceeding. The Supreme Court has recently made clear the importance of providing counsel both at the earliest possible time after arrest and on appeal. See <em>Crooker v. California</em>, 357 U.S. 433 (1958); <em>Cicenia v. LaGay</em>, 357 U.S. 504 (1958); <em>White v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S. 59 (1963); <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>, 372 U.S. 335 (1963); <em>Douglas v. California</em>, 372 U.S. 353 (1963). See also Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Special Committee to Study the Defender System, Equal Justice for the Accused (1959); Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Justice (1963); Beaney, Right to Counsel Before Arraignment, 45 Minn.L.Rev. 771 (1961); Boskey, The Right to Counsel in Appellate Proceedings, 45 Minn.L.Rev. 783 (1961); Douglas, The Right to Counsel&mdash;A Foreword, 45 Minn.L.Rev. 693 (1961); Kamisar, The Right to Counsel and the Fourteenth Amendment; A Dialogue on &ldquo;The Most Pervasive Right&rdquo; of an Accused, 30 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1 (1962); Kamisar, Betts v. Brady Twenty Years Later: The Right to Counsel and Due Process Values, 61 Mich.L.Rev. 219 (1962); Symposium, The Right to Counsel, 22 Legal Aid Briefcase 4&ndash;48 (1963). Provision has been made by law for a Legal Aid Agency in the District of Columbia which is charged with the duty of providing counsel and courts are admonished to assign such counsel &ldquo;as early in the proceeding as practicable.&rdquo; D.C. Code &sect;2&ndash;2202. Congress has now made provision for assignment of counsel and their compensation in all of the districts. Criminal Justice Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 552).</p>
<p class="note-body">Like the original rule the amended rule provides a right to counsel which is broader in two respects than that for which compensation is provided in the Criminal Justice Act of 1964: (1) the right extends to petty offenses to be tried in the district courts, and (2) the right extends to defendants unable to obtain counsel for reasons other than financial. These rules do not cover procedures other than those in the courts of the United States and before United States commissioners. See Rule 1. Hence, the problems relating to the providing of counsel prior to the initial appearance before a court or commissioner are not dealt with in this rule. Cf. <em>Escobedo v. United States</em>, 378 U.S. 478 (1964); Enker and Elsen, Counsel for the Suspect: <em>Massiah v. United States</em> and <em>Escobedo v. Illinois</em>, 49 Minn.L.Rev. 47 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;This subdivision expresses the right of the defendant unable to obtain counsel to have such counsel assigned at any stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the commissioner or court through the appeal, unless he waives such right. The phrase &ldquo;from his initial appearance before the commissioner or court&rdquo; is intended to require the assignment of counsel as promptly as possible after it appears that the defendant is unable to obtain counsel. The right to assignment of counsel is not limited to those financially unable to obtain counsel. If a defendant is able to compensate counsel but still cannot obtain counsel, he is entitled to the assignment of counsel even though not to free counsel.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to reflect the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968. The phrase &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; is defined in rule 54.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). Rule 44(c) establishes a procedure for avoiding the occurrence of events which might otherwise give rise to a plausible post-conviction claim that because of joint representation the defendants in a criminal case were deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Although &ldquo;courts have differed with respect to the scope and nature of the affirmative duty of the trial judge to assure that criminal defendants are not deprived of their right to the effective assistance of counsel by joint representation of conflicting interests,&rdquo; <em>Holloway v. Arkansas</em>, 98 S.Ct. 1173 (1978) (where the Court found it unnecessary to reach this issue), this amendment is generally consistent with the current state of the law in several circuits. As held in <em>United States v. Carrigan</em>, 543 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir. 1976):</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">When a potential conflict of interest arises, either where a court has assigned the same counsel to represent several defendants or where the same counsel has been retained by co-defendants in a criminal case, the proper course of action for the trial judge is to conduct a hearing to determine whether a conflict exists to the degree that a defendant may be prevented from receiving advice and assistance sufficient to afford him the quality of representation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The defendant should be fully advised by the trial court of the facts underlying the potential conflict and be given the opportunity to express his views.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also <em>United States v. Lawriw</em>, 568 F.2d 98 (8th Cir. 1977) (duty on trial judge to make inquiry where joint representation by appointed or retained counsel, and &ldquo;without such an inquiry a finding of knowing and intelligent waiver will seldom, if ever, be sustained by this Court&rdquo;); <em>Abraham v. United States</em>, 549 F.2d 236 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Mari</em>, 526 F.2d 117 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Truglio</em>, 493 F.2d 574 (4th Cir. 1974) (joint representation should cause trial judge &ldquo;to inquire whether the defenses to be presented in any way conflict&rdquo;); <em>United States v. DeBerry</em>, 487 F.2d 488 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States ex rel. Hart v. Davenport</em>, 478 F.2d 203 (3d Cir. 1973) (noting there &ldquo;is much to be said for the rule&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;which assumes prejudice and nonwaiver if there has been no on-the-record inquiry by the court as to the hazards to defendants from joint representation&rdquo;; <em>United States v. Alberti</em>, 470 F.2d 878 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Foster</em>, 469 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1972) (lack of sufficient inquiry shifts the burden of proof on the question of prejudice to the government); <em>Campbell v. United States</em>, 352 F.2d 359 (D.C. Cir. 1965) (where joint representation, court &ldquo;has a duty to ascertain whether each defendant has an awareness of the potential risks of that course and nevertheless has knowingly chosen it&rdquo;). Some states have taken a like position; see, e.g., <em>State v. Olsen, &mdash;&mdash;</em> Minn. &mdash;&mdash;, 258 N.W.2d 898 (1977).</p>
<p class="note-body">This procedure is also consistent with that recommended in the ABA Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge (Approved Draft, 1972), which provide in &sect;3.4(b):</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Whenever two or more defendants who have been jointly charged, or whose cases have been consolidated, are represented by the same attorney, the trial judge should inquire into potential conflicts which may jeopardize the right of each defendant to the fidelity of his counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Avoiding a conflict-of-interest situation is in the first instance a responsibility of the attorney. If a lawyer represents &ldquo;multiple clients having potentially differing interests, he must weigh carefully the possibility that his judgment may be impaired or his loyalty divided if he accepts or continues the employment,&rdquo; and he is to &ldquo;resolve all doubts against the propriety of the representation.&rdquo; Code of Professional Responsibility, Ethical Consideration 5&ndash;15. See also ABA Standards Relating to the Defense Function &sect;3.5(b) (Approved Draft, 1971), concluding that the &ldquo;potential for conflict of interest in representing multiple defendants is so grave that ordinarily a lawyer should decline to act for more than one of several co-defendants except in unusual situations when, after careful investigation, it is clear that no conflict is likely to develop and when the several defendants give an informed consent to such multiple representation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It by no means follows that the inquiry provided for by rule 44(c) is unnecessary. For one thing, even the most diligent attorney may be unaware of facts giving rise to a potential conflict. Often &ldquo;counsel must operate somewhat in the dark and feel their way uncertainly to an understanding of what their clients may be called upon to meet upon a trial&rdquo; and consequently &ldquo;are frequently unable to foresee developments which may require changes in strategy.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Carrigan</em>, supra (concurring opinion). &ldquo;Because the conflicts are often subtle it is not enough to rely upon counsel, who may not be totally disinterested, to make sure that each of his joint clients has made an effective waiver.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Lawriw</em>, supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">Moreover, it is important that the trial judge ascertain whether the effective and fair administration of justice would be adversely affected by continued joint representation, even when an actual conflict is not then apparent. As noted in <em>United States v. Mari</em>, supra (concurring opinion):</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Trial court insistence that, except in extraordinary circumstances, codefendants retain separate counsel will in the long run&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;prove salutary not only to the administration of justice and the appearance of justice but the cost of justice; habeas corpus petitions, petitions for new trials, appeals and occasionally retrials&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;can be avoided. Issues as to whether there is an actual conflict of interest, whether the conflict has resulted in prejudice, whether there has been a waiver, whether the waiver is intelligent and knowledgeable, for example, can all be avoided. Where a conflict that first did not appear subsequently arises in or before trial,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;continuances or mistrials can be saved. Essentially by the time a case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gets to the appellate level the harm to the appearance of justice has already been done, whether or not reversal occurs; at the trial level it is a matter which is so easy to avoid.</p>
<p class="note-body">A rule 44(c) inquiry is required whether counsel is assigned or retained. It &ldquo;makes no difference whether counsel is appointed by the court or selected by the defendants; even where selected by the defendants the same dangers of potential conflict exist, and it is also possible that the rights of the public to the proper administration of justice may be affected adversely.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Mari</em>, supra (concurring opinion). See also <em>United States v. Lawriw</em>, supra. When there has been &ldquo;no discussion as to possible conflict initiated by the court,&rdquo; it cannot be assumed that the choice of counsel by the defendants &ldquo;was intelligently made with knowledge of any possible conflict.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Carrigan</em>, supra. As for assigned counsel, it is provided by statute that &ldquo;the court shall appoint separate counsel for defendants having interests that cannot properly be represented by the same counsel, or when other good cause is shown.&rdquo; 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006(A)(b). Rule 44(c) is not intended to prohibit the automatic appointment of separate counsel in the first instance, see <em>Ford v. United States</em>, 379 F.2d 123 (D.C. Cir. 1967); <em>Lollar v. United States</em>, 376 F.2d 243 (D.C. Cir. 1967), which would obviate the necessity for an inquiry.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under rule 44(c), an inquiry is called for when the joined defendants are represented by the same attorney and also when they are represented by attorneys &ldquo;associated in the practice of law.&rdquo; This is consistent with <!-- PDFPage:152 -->Code of Professional Responsibility, Disciplinary Rule 5&ndash;105(D) (providing that if &ldquo;a lawyer is required to decline employment or to withdraw from employment&rdquo; because of a potential conflict, &ldquo;no partner or associate of his or his firm may accept or continue such employment&rdquo;); and ABA Standards Relating to the Defense Function &sect;3.5(b) (Approved Draft, 1971) (applicable to &ldquo;a lawyer or lawyers who are associated in practice&rdquo;). Attorneys representing joined defendants should so advise the court if they are associated in the practice of law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule 44(c) procedure is not limited to cases expected to go to trial. Although the more dramatic conflict situations, such as when the question arises as to whether the several defendants should take the stand, <em>Morgan v. United States</em>, 396 F.2d 110 (2d Cir. 1968), tend to occur in a trial context, serious conflicts may also arise when one or more of the jointly represented defendants pleads guilty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The problem is that even where as here both codefendants pleaded guilty there are frequently potential conflicts of interest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[T]he prosecutor may be inclined to accept a guilty plea from one codefendant which may harm the interests of the other. The contrast in the dispositions of the cases may have a harmful impact on the codefendant who does not initially plead guilty; he may be pressured into pleading guilty himself rather than face his codefendant's bargained-for testimony at a trial. And it will be his own counsel's recommendation to the initially pleading codefendant which will have contributed to this harmful impact upon him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[I]n a given instance it would be at least conceivable that the prosecutor would be willing to accept pleas to lesser offenses from two defendants in preference to a plea of guilty by one defendant to a greater offense.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>United States v. Mari</em>, supra (concurring opinion). To the same effect is ABA Standards Relating to the Defense Function at 213&ndash;14.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is contemplated that under rule 44(c) the court will make appropriate inquiry of the defendants and of counsel regarding the possibility of a conflict of interest developing. Whenever it is necessary to make a more particularized inquiry into the nature of the contemplated defense, the court should &ldquo;pursue the inquiry with defendants and their counsel on the record but in chambers&rdquo; so as &ldquo;to avoid the possibility of prejudicial disclosures to the prosecution.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Foster</em>, supra. It is important that each defendant be &ldquo;fully advised of the facts underlying the potential conflict and is given an opportunity to express his or her views.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Alberti</em>, supra. The rule specifically requires that the court personally advise each defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel, including separate representation. See <em>United States v. Foster</em>, supra, requiring that the court make a determination that jointly represented defendants &ldquo;understand that they may retain separate counsel, or if qualified, may have such counsel appointed by the court and paid for by the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Under rule 44(c), the court is to take appropriate measures to protect each defendant's right to counsel unless it appears &ldquo;there is good cause to believe no conflict of interest is likely to arise&rdquo; as a consequence of the continuation of such joint representation. A less demanding standard would not adequately protect the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel or the effective administration of criminal justice. Although joint representation &ldquo;is not per se violative of constitutional guarantees of effective assistance of counsel, <em>Holloway v. Arkansas</em>, supra, it would not suffice to require the court to act only when a conflict of interest is then apparent, for it is not possible &ldquo;to anticipate with complete accuracy the course that a criminal trial may take.&rdquo; <em>Fryar v. United States</em>, 404 F.2d 1071 (10th Cir. 1968). This is particularly so in light of the fact that if a conflict later arises and a defendant thereafter raises a Sixth Amendment objection, a court must grant relief without indulging &ldquo;in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.&rdquo; <em>Glasser v. United States</em>, 315 U.S. 60 (1942). This is because, as the Supreme Court more recently noted in <em>Holloway v. Arkansas</em>, supra, &ldquo;in a case of joint representation of conflicting interests the evil&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to refrain from doing,&rdquo; and this makes it &ldquo;virtually impossible&rdquo; to assess the impact of the conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 44(c) does not specify what particular measures must be taken. It is appropriate to leave this within the court's discretion, for the measures which will best protect each defendant's right to counsel may well vary from case to case. One possible course of action is for the court to obtain a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of the right to separate representation, for, as noted in <em>Holloway v. Arkansas</em>, supra, &ldquo;a defendant may waive his right to the assistance of an attorney unhindered by a conflict of interests.&rdquo; See <em>United States v. DeBerry</em>, supra, holding that defendants should be jointly represented only if &ldquo;the court has ascertained that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;each understands clearly the possibilities of a conflict of interest and waives any rights in connection with it.&rdquo; It must be emphasized that a &ldquo;waiver of the right to separate representation should not be accepted by the court unless the defendants have each been informed of the probable hazards; and the voluntary character of their waiver is apparent.&rdquo; ABA Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge at 45. <em>United States v. Garcia</em>, supra, spells out in significant detail what should be done to assure an adequate waiver:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">As in Rule 11 procedures, the district court should address each defendant personally and forthrightly advise him of the potential dangers of representation by counsel with a conflict of interest. The defendant must be at liberty to question the district court as to the nature and consequences of his legal representation. Most significantly, the court should seek to elicit a narrative response from each defendant that he has been advised of his right to effective representation, that he understands the details of his attorney's possible conflict of interest and the potential perils of such a conflict, that he has discussed the matter with his attorney or if he wishes with outside counsel, and that he voluntarily waives his Sixth Amendment protections. It is, of course, vital that the waiver be established by &ldquo;clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous language.&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mere assent in response to a series of questions from the bench may in some circumstances constitute an adequate waiver, but the court should nonetheless endeavor to have each defendant personally articulate in detail his intent to forego this significant constitutional protection. Recordation of the waiver colloque between defendant and judge, will also serve the government's interest by assisting in shielding any potential conviction from collateral attack, either on Sixth Amendment grounds or on a Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment &ldquo;fundamental fairness&rdquo; basis.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also Hyman, Joint Representation of Multiple Defendants in a Criminal Trial: The Court's Headache, 5 Hofstra L.Rev. 315, 334 (1977).</p>
<p class="note-body">Another possibility is that the court will order that the defendants be separately represented in subsequent proceedings in the case. Though the court must remain alert to and take account of the fact that &ldquo;certain advantages might accrue from joint representation,&rdquo; <em>Holloway v. Arkansas</em>, supra, it need not permit the joint representation to continue merely because the defendants express a willingness to so proceed. That is,</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">there will be cases where the court should require separate counsel to represent certain defendants despite the expressed wishes of such defendants. Indeed, failure of the trial court to require separate representation may&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;require a new trial, even though the defendants have expressed a desire to continue with the same counsel. The right to effective representation by counsel whose loyalty is undivided is so paramount in the proper administration of criminal justice that it must in some cases take precedence over all other considerations, including the expressed pref<!-- PDFPage:153 -->erence of the defendants concerned and their attorney.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>United States v. Carrigan</em>, supra (concurring opinion). See also <em>United States v. Lawriw</em>, supra; <em>Abraham v. United States</em>, supra; ABA Standards Relating to the Defense Function at 213, concluding that in some circumstances &ldquo;even full disclosure and consent of the client may not be an adequate protection.&rdquo; As noted in <em>United States v. Dolan</em>, 570 F.2d 1177 (3d Cir. 1978), such an order may be necessary where the trial judge is</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">not satisfied that the waiver is proper. For example, a defendant may be competent enough to stand trial, but not competent enough to understand the complex, subtle, and sometimes unforeseeable dangers inherent in multiple representation. More importantly, the judge may find that the waiver cannot be intelligently made simply because he is not in a position to inform the defendant of the foreseeable prejudices multiple representation might entail for him.</p>
<p class="note-body">As concluded in <em>Dolan</em>, &ldquo;exercise of the court's supervisory powers by disqualifying an attorney representing multiple criminal defendants in spite of the defendants&rsquo; express desire to retain that attorney does not necessarily abrogate defendant's sixth amendment rights&rdquo;. It does not follow from the absolute right of self-representation recognized in <em>Faretta v. California</em>, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), that there is an <em>absolute</em> right to counsel of one's own choice. Thus,</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">when a trial court finds an actual conflict of interest which impairs the ability of a criminal defendant's chosen counsel to conform with the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, the court should not be required to tolerate an inadequate representation of a defendant. Such representation not only constitutes a breach of professional ethics and invites disrespect for the integrity of the court, but it is also detrimental to the independent interest of the trial judge to be free from future attacks over the adequacy of the waiver or the fairness of the proceedings in his own court and the subtle problems implicating the defendant's comprehension of the waiver. Under such circumstances, the court can elect to exercise its supervisory authority over members of the bar to enforce the ethical standard requiring an attorney to decline multiple representation.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>United States v. Dolan</em>, supra. See also Geer, Conflict of Interest and Multiple Defendants in a Criminal Case: Professional Responsibilities of the Defense Attorney, 62 Minn.L.Rev. 119 (1978); Note, Conflict of Interests in Multiple Representation of Criminal Co-Defendants, 68 J.Crim.L.&C. 226 (1977).</p>
<p class="note-body">The failure in a particular case to conduct a rule 44(c) inquiry would not, standing alone, necessitate the reversal of a conviction of a jointly represented defendant. However, as is currently the case, a reviewing court is more likely to assume a conflict resulted from the joint representation when no inquiry or an inadequate inquiry was conducted. <em>United States v. Carrigan</em>, supra; <em>United States v. DeBerry</em>, supra. On the other hand, the mere fact that a rule 44(c) inquiry was conducted in the early stages of the case does not relieve the court of all responsibility in this regard thereafter. The obligation placed upon the court by rule 44(c) is a continuing one, and thus in a particular case further inquiry may be necessary on a later occasion because of new developments suggesting a potential conflict of interest.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>

<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 44 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 44 now refers to the &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; of counsel, rather than the assignment of counsel; the Committee believed the former term was more appropriate. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A. In Rule 44(c), the term &ldquo;retained or assigned&rdquo; has been deleted as being unnecessary, without changing the court's responsibility to conduct an inquiry where joint representation occurs.</p>

<p class="note-body">The rule is in substance the same as Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. It seems desirable that matters covered by this rule should be regulated in the same manner for civil and criminal cases, in order to preclude possibility of confusion.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule supersedes the method of computing time prescribed by Rule 13 of the Criminal Appeals Rules, promulgated on May 7, 1934, 292 U.S. 661.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). This rule abolishes the expiration of a term of court as a time limitation for the taking of any step in a criminal proceeding, as is done for civil cases by Rule 6(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. In view of the fact that the duration of terms of court varies among the several districts and the further fact that the length of time for the taking of any step limited by a term of court depends on the stage within the term when the time begins to run, specific time limitations have been substituted for the taking of any step which previously had to be taken within the term of court.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;This amendment conforms the subdivision with the amendments made effective on July 1, 1963, to the comparable provision in Civil Rule 6(a). The only major change is to treat Saturdays as legal holidays for the purpose of computing time.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;The amendment conforms the subdivision to the amendments made effective in 1948 to the comparable provision in Civil Rule 6(b). One of these conforming changes, substituting the words &ldquo;extend the time&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;enlarge the period&rdquo; clarifies the ambiguity which gave rise to the decision in <em>United States v. Robinson</em>, 361 U.S. 220 (1960). The amendment also, in connection with the amendments to Rules 29 and 37, makes it clear that the only circumstances under which extensions can be granted under Rules 29, 33, 34, 35, 37(a)(2) and 39(c) are those stated in them.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c).&mdash;Subdivision (c) of Rule 45 is rescinded as unnecessary in view of the 1963 amendment to 28 U.S.C. &sect;138 eliminating terms of court.</p>

Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day are to be observed on the third Monday in February, the last Monday in May and the fourth Monday in October, respectively, rather than, as heretofore, on February 22, May 30, and November 11, respectively. Columbus Day is to be observed on the second Monday in October. New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas continue to be observed on the traditional days.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (a) takes account of the fact that on rare occasion severe weather conditions or other circumstances beyond control will make it impossible to meet a filing deadline under Rule 45(a). Illustrative is an incident which occurred in Columbus, Ohio during the &ldquo;great blizzard of 1978,&rdquo; in which weather conditions deteriorated to the point where personnel in the clerk's office found it virtually impossible to reach the courthouse, and where the GSA Building Manager found it necessary to close and secure the entire building. The amendment covers that situation and also similar situations in which weather or other conditions made the clerk's office, though open, not readily accessible to the lawyer. Whether the clerk's office was in fact &ldquo;inaccessible&rdquo; on a given date is to be determined by the district court. Some state time computation statutes contain language somewhat similar to that in the amendment; see, e.g., Md.Code Ann. art. 94, &sect;2.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to extend the exclusion of intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays to the computation of time periods less than 11 days. Under the current version of the Rule, parties bringing motions under rules with 10-day periods could have as few as 5 working days to prepare their motions. This change corresponds to the change being made in the comparable provision in Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., which becomes a legal holiday effective January 1986, has been added to the list of legal holidays enumerated in the Rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 45 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">The additional three days provided by Rule 45(c) is extended to the means of service authorized by the new paragraph (D) added to Rule 5(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including&mdash;with the consent of the person served&mdash;service by electronic means. The means of service authorized in civil actions apply to criminal cases under Rule 49(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 45(d), which governs the timing of written motions and affidavits, has been moved to Rule 47.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 46. Release from Custody; Supervising Detention</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Before Trial.</strong> The provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3142 and 3144 govern pretrial release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) During Trial.</strong> A person released before trial continues on release during trial under the same <!-- PDFPage:155 -->terms and conditions. But the court may order different terms and conditions or terminate the release if necessary to ensure that the person will be present during trial or that the person's conduct will not obstruct the orderly and expeditious progress of the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Pending Sentencing or Appeal</strong> The provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3143 govern release pending sentencing or appeal. The burden of establishing that the defendant will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community rests with the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Pending Hearing on a Violation of Probation or Supervised Release.</strong> Rule 32.1(a)(6) governs release pending a hearing on a violation of probation or supervised release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Surety.</strong> The court must not approve a bond unless any surety appears to be qualified. Every surety, except a legally approved corporate surety, must demonstrate by affidavit that its assets are adequate. The court may require the affidavit to describe the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the property that the surety proposes to use as security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any encumbrance on that property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the number and amount of any other undischarged bonds and bail undertakings the surety has issued; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any other liability of the surety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Bail Forfeiture.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>Declaration.</em></strong> The court must declare the bail forfeited if a condition of the bond is breached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Setting Aside.</em></strong> The court may set aside in whole or in part a bail forfeiture upon any condition the court may impose if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the surety later surrenders into custody the person released on the surety's appearance bond; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it appears that justice does not require bail forfeiture.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Enforcement.</em></strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Default Judgment and Execution</em>. If it does not set aside a bail forfeiture, the court must, upon the government's motion, enter a default judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Jurisdiction and Service</em>. By entering into a bond, each surety submits to the district court's jurisdiction and irrevocably appoints the district clerk as its agent to receive service of any filings affecting its liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Motion to Enforce</em>. The court may, upon the government's motion, enforce the surety's liability without an independent action. The government must serve any motion, and notice as the court prescribes, on the district clerk. If so served, the clerk must promptly mail a copy to the surety at its last known address.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) <em>Remission.</em></strong> After entering a judgment under Rule 46(f)(3), the court may remit in whole or in part the judgment under the same conditions specified in Rule 46(f)(2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Exoneration.</strong> The court must exonerate the surety and release any bail when a bond condition has been satisfied or when the court has set aside or remitted the forfeiture. The court must exonerate a surety who deposits cash in the amount of the bond or timely surrenders the defendant into custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Supervising Detention Pending Trial.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> To eliminate unnecessary detention, the court must supervise the detention within the district of any defendants awaiting trial and of any persons held as material witnesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Reports.</em></strong> An attorney for the government must report biweekly to the court, listing each material witness held in custody for more than 10 days pending indictment, arraignment, or trial. For each material witness listed in the report, an attorney for the government must state why the witness should not be released with or without a deposition being taken under Rule 15(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Forfeiture of Property.</strong> The court may dispose of a charged offense by ordering the forfeiture of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3142(c)(1)(B)(xi) property under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146(d), if a fine in the amount of the property's value would be an appropriate sentence for the charged offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(j) Producing a Statement.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> Rule 26.2(a)&ndash;(d) and (f) applies at a detention hearing under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3142, unless the court for good cause rules otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Sanctions for Not Producing a Statement.</em></strong> If a party disobeys a Rule 26.2 order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony at the detention hearing.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(1). This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. 596, 597 [now 3141].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(2). This rule is substantially a restatement of Rule 6 of Criminal Appeals Rules, with the addition of a reference to bail pending certiorari. This rule does not supersede 18 U.S.C. 682 [now 3731] (Appeals; on behalf of the United States; rules of practice and procedure), which provides for the admission of the defendant to bail on his own recognizance pending an appeal taken by the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law, 28 U.S.C. [former] 657.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This rule is a restatement of existing practice, and is based in part on 6 U.S.C. 15 [now 31 U.S.C. 9103] (Bonds or notes of United States in lieu of recognizance, stipulation, bond, guaranty, or undertaking; place of deposit; return to depositor; contractors&rsquo; bonds).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). This rule is similar to Sec. 79 of A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure introducing, however, an element of flexibility. Corporate sureties are regulated by 6 U.S.C. 6&ndash;14 [now 31 U.S.C. 9304&ndash;9308].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). 1. With the exception hereafter noted, this rule is substantially a restatement of existing law in somewhat greater detail than contained in 18 U.S.C. [former] 601 (Remission of penalty of recognizance).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Subdivision (f)(2) changes existing law in that it increases the discretion of the court to set aside a forfeit<!-- PDFPage:156 -->ure. The present power of the court is limited to cases in which the defendant's default had not been willful.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The second sentence of paragraph (3) is similar to Rule 73(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. This paragraph also substitutes simple motion procedure for enforcing forfeited bail bonds for the procedure by <em>scire facias</em>, which was abolished by Rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (g). This rule is a restatement of existing law and practice. It is based in part on 18 U.S.C. 599 [now 3142] (Surrender by bail).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c).&mdash;The more inclusive word &ldquo;terms&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;amount&rdquo; in view of the amendment to subdivision (d) authorizing releases without security on such conditions as are necessary to insure the appearance of the defendant. The phrase added at the end of this subdivision is designed to encourage commissioners and judges to set the terms of bail so as to eliminate unnecessary detention. See <em>Stack v. Boyle</em>, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); <em>Bandy v. United States</em>, 81 S.Ct. 197 (1960); <em>Bandy v. United States</em>, 82 S.Ct. 11 (1961); <em>Carbo v. United States</em>, 82 S.Ct. 662 (1962); review den. 369 U.S. 868 (1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d).&mdash;The amendments are designed to make possible (and to encourage) the release on bail of a greater percentage of indigent defendants than now are released. To the extent that other considerations make it reasonably likely that the defendant will appear it is both good practice and good economics to release him on bail even though he cannot arrange for cash or bonds in even small amounts. In fact it has been suggested that it may be a denial of constitutional rights to hold indigent prisoners in custody for no other reason than their inability to raise the money for a bond. <em>Bandy v. United States</em>, 81 S.Ct. 197 (1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first change authorizes the acceptance as security of a deposit of cash or government securities in an amount less than the face amount of the bond. Since a defendant typically purchases a bail bond for a cash payment of a certain percentage of the face of the bond, a direct deposit with the court of that amount (returnable to the defendant upon his appearance) will often be equally adequate as a deterrent to flight. Cf. Ill.CodeCrim.Proc. &sect;110&ndash;7 (1963).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second change authorizes the release of the defendant without financial security on his written agreement to appear when other deterrents appear reasonably adequate. See the discussion of such deterrents in <em>Bandy v. United States</em>, 81 S.Ct. 197 (1960). It also permits the imposition of nonfinancial conditions as the price of dispensing with security for the bond. Such conditions are commonly used in England. Devin, The Criminal Prosecution in England, 89 (1958). See the suggestion in Note, Bail: An Ancient Practice Reexamined, 70 Yale L.J. 966, 975 (1961) that such conditions &ldquo;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* might include release in custody of a third party, such as the accused's employer, minister, attorney, or a private organization; release subject to a duty to report periodically to the court or other public official; or even release subject to a duty to return to jail each night.&rdquo; Willful failure to appear after forfeiture of bail is a separate criminal offense and hence an added deterrent to flight. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146.</p>
<p class="note-body">For full discussion and general approval of the changes made here see Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Criminal Justice 58&ndash;89 (1963).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (h).&mdash;The purpose of this new subdivision is to place upon the court in each district the responsibility for supervising the detention of defendants and witnesses and for eliminating all unnecessary detention. The device of the report by the attorney for the government is used because in many districts defendants will be held in custody in places where the court sits only at infrequent intervals and hence they cannot be brought personally before the court without substantial delay. The magnitude of the problem is suggested by the facts that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1960, there were 23,811 instances in which persons were held in custody pending trial and that the average length of detention prior to disposition (i.e., dismissal, acquittal, probation, sentence to imprisonment, or any other method of removing the case from the court docket) was 25.3 days. Federal Prisons 1960, table 22, p. 60. Since 27,645 of the 38,855 defendants whose cases were terminated during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1960, pleaded guilty (United States Attorneys Statistical Report, October 1960, p. 1 and table 2), it would appear that the greater part of the detention reported occurs prior to the initial appearance of the defendant before the court.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are intended primarily to bring rule 46 into general conformity with the Bail Reform Act of 1966 and to deal in the rule with some issues not now included within the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) makes explicit that the Bail Reform Act of 1966 controls release on bail prior to trial. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146 refers to release of a defendant. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3149 refers to release of a material witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) deals with an issue not dealt with by the Bail Reform Act of 1966 or explicitly in former rule 46, that is, the issue of bail during trial. The rule gives the trial judge discretion to continue the prior conditions of release or to impose such additional conditions as are adequate to insure presence at trial or to insure that his conduct will not obstruct the orderly and expeditious progress of the trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides for release during the period between a conviction and sentencing and for the giving of a notice of appeal or of the expiration of the time allowed for filing notice of appeal. There are situations in which defense counsel may informally indicate an intention to appeal but not actually give notice of appeal for several days. To deal with this situation the rule makes clear that the district court has authority to release under the terms of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148 pending notice of appeal (<em>e.g</em>., during the ten days after entry of judgment; see rule 4(b) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure). After the filing of notice of appeal, release by the district court shall be in accordance with the provisions of rule 9(b) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. The burden of establishing that grounds for release exist is placed upon the defendant in the view that the fact of conviction justifies retention in custody in situations where doubt exists as to whether a defendant can be safely released pending either sentence or the giving of notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (g) remain unchanged. They were formerly lettered (e), (f), (g), and (h).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The addition of subdivision (i) is one of a series of similar amendments to Rules 26.2, 32, 32.1, and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings Under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 which extend Rule 26.2 to other proceedings and hearings. As pointed out in the Committee Note to the amendment to Rule 26.2, there is continuing and compelling need to assess the credibility and reliability of information relied upon by the court, whether the witness's testimony is being considered at a pretrial proceeding, at trial, or a post-trial proceeding. Production of a witness's prior statements directly furthers that goal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:157 --><p class="note-body">The need for reliable information is no less crucial in a proceeding to determine whether a defendant should be released from custody. The issues decided at pretrial detention hearings are important to both a defendant and the community. For example, a defendant charged with criminal acts may be incarcerated prior to an adjudication of guilt without bail on grounds of future dangerousness which is not subject to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the defendant clearly has an interest in remaining free prior to trial, the community has an equally compelling interest in being protected from potential criminal activity committed by persons awaiting trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">In upholding the constitutionality of pretrial detention based upon dangerousness, the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Salerno</em>, 481 U.S. 739 (1986), stressed the existence of procedural safeguards in the Bail Reform Act. The Act provides for the right to counsel and the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. <em>See, e.g</em>., 18 U.S.C. &sect;3142(f) (right of defendant to cross-examine adverse witness). Those safeguards, said the Court, are &ldquo;specifically designed to further the accuracy of that determination.&rdquo; 481 U.S. at 751. The Committee believes that requiring the production of a witness's statement will further enhance the fact-finding process.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee recognized that pretrial detention hearings are often held very early in a prosecution, and that a particular witness's statement may not yet be on file, or even known about. Thus, the amendment recognizes that in a particular case, the court may decide that good cause exists for not applying the rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 46 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the general rule is that an appeal to a circuit court deprives the district court of jurisdiction, Rule 46(c) recognizes the apparent exception to that rule&mdash;that the district court retains jurisdiction to decide whether the defendant should be detained, even if a notice of appeal has been filed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Meyers</em>, 95 F.3d 1475 (10th Cir. 1996), <em>cert. denied</em>, 522 U.S. 1006 (1997) (initial decision of whether to release defendant pending appeal is to be made by district court); <em>United States v. Affleck</em>, 765 F.2d 944 (10th Cir. 1985); <em>Jago v. United States District Court</em>, 570 F.2d 618 (6th Cir. 1978) (release of defendant pending appeal must first be sought in district court). <em>See also</em> Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 9(b) and the accompanying Committee Note.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 46(h) deletes the requirement that the attorney for the government file bi-weekly reports with the court concerning the status of any defendants in pretrial detention. The Committee believed that the requirement was no longer necessary in light of the Speedy Trial Act provisions. 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3161, et seq. On the other hand, the requirement that the attorney for the government file reports regarding detained material witnesses has been retained in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 46(i) addresses the ability of a court to order forfeiture of property where a defendant has failed to appear as required by the court. The language in the current rule, Rule 46(h), was originally included by Congress. The new language has been restyled with no change in substance or practice intended. Under this provision, the court may only forfeit property as permitted under 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3146(d) and 3142(c)(1)(B)(xi). The term &ldquo;appropriate sentence&rdquo; means a sentence that is consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body">1994&mdash;Subd. (i)(1). Pub. L. 103&ndash;322 substituted &ldquo;3142&rdquo; for &ldquo;3144&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1984&mdash;Subd. (a). Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;209(d)(1), substituted &ldquo;&sect;&sect;3142 and 3144&rdquo; for &ldquo;&sect;3146, &sect;3148, or &sect;3149&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subd. (c). Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;209(d)(2), substituted &ldquo;3143&rdquo; for &ldquo;3148&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subd. (e)(2). Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;209(d)(3), substituted &ldquo;be set aside in whole or in part upon such conditions as the court may impose, if a person released upon execution of an appearance bond with a surety is subsequently surrendered by the surety into custody or if it otherwise appears that justice does not require the forfeiture&rdquo; for &ldquo;set aside, upon such conditions as the court may impose, if it appears that justice does not require the enforcement of the forfeiture&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subd. (h). Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;209(d)(4), added subd. (h).</p>

<p class="note-body">2. This rule is intended to state general requirements for all motions. For particular provisions applying to specific motions, see Rules 6(b)(2), 12, 14, 15, 16, 17(b) and (c), 21, 22, 29 and Rule 41(e). See also Rule 49.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The last sentence providing that a motion may be supported by affidavit is not intended to permit &ldquo;speaking motions&rdquo; (e.g. motion to dismiss an indictment for insufficiency supported by affidavits), but to authorize the use of affidavits when affidavits are appropriate to establish a fact (e.g. authority to take a deposition or former jeopardy).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The first sentence of this rule will change existing law. The common-law rule that the public prosecutor may enter a <em>nolle prosequi</em> in his discretion, without any action by the court, prevails in the Federal courts, <em>Confiscation Cases</em>, 7 Wall. 454, 457; <em>United States v. Woody</em>, 2 F.2d 262 (D.Mont.). This provision will permit the filing of a nolle prosequi only by leave of court. This is similar to the rule now prevailing in many States. A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure, Commentaries, pp. 895&ndash;897.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule confers the power to file a dismissal by leave of court on the Attorney General, as well as on the United States attorney, since under existing law the Attorney General exercises &ldquo;general superintendence and direction&rdquo; over the United States attorneys &ldquo;as to the manner of discharging their respective duties,&rdquo; 5 U.S.C. 317 [now 28 U.S.C. 509, 547]. Moreover it is the administrative practice for the Attorney General to supervise the filing of a <em>nolle prosequi</em> by United States attorneys. Consequently it seemed appropriate that the Attorney General should have such power directly.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The rule permits the filing of a dismissal of an indictment, information or complaint. The word &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; was included in order to resolve a doubt prevailing in some districts as to whether the United States attorney may file a <em>nolle prosequi</em> between the time when the defendant is bound over by the United States commissioner and the finding of an indictment. It has been assumed in a few districts that the power does not exist and that the United States attorney must await action of the grand jury, even if he deems it proper to dismiss the prosecution. This situation is an unnecessary hardship to some defendants.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The second sentence is a restatement of existing law, <em>Confiscation Cases</em>, 7 Wall. 454&ndash;457; <em>United States v. Shoemaker</em>, 27 Fed. Cases No. 16, 279 (C.C.Ill.). If the trial has commenced, the defendant has a right to insist on a disposition on the merits and may properly object to the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule is a restatement of the inherent power of the court to dismiss a case for want of prosecution. <em>Ex parte Altman</em>, 34 F.Supp. 106 (S.D.Cal.).</p>

Carlone</em>, 666 F.2d 1112, 1116 (7th Cir. 1981) (suggesting that Rule 48(b) could provide an alternate basis in an extreme case to dismiss an indictment, without reference to Speedy Trial Act); <em>United States v. Balochi</em>, 527 F.2d 562, 563&ndash;64 (4th Cir. 1976) (per curiam) (Rule 48(b) is broader in compass).

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;The words &ldquo;adverse parties&rdquo; in the original rule introduced a question of interpretation. When, for example, is a co-defendant an adverse party? The amendment requires service on each of the parties thus avoiding the problem of interpretation and promoting full exchange of information among the parties. No restriction is intended, however, upon agreements among co-defendants or between the defendants and the <!-- PDFPage:159 -->government restricting exchange of papers in the interest of eliminating unnecessary expense. Cf. the amendment made effective July 1, 1963, to Civil Rule 5(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c).&mdash;The words &ldquo;affected thereby&rdquo; are deleted in order to require notice to all parties. Cf. the similar change made effective July 1, 1963, to Civil Rule 77(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">The sentence added at the end of the subdivision eliminates the possibility of extension of the time to appeal beyond the provision for a 30 day extension on a showing or &ldquo;excusable neglect&rdquo; provided in Rule 37(a)(2). Cf. the similar change made in Civil Rule 77(d) effective in 1948. The question has arisen in a number of cases whether failure or delay in giving notice on the part of the clerk results in an extension of the time for appeal. The &ldquo;general rule&rdquo; has been said to be that in the event of such failure or delay &ldquo;the time for taking an appeal runs from the date of later actual notice or receipt of the clerk's notice rather than from the date of entry of the order.&rdquo; <em>Lohman v. United States</em>, 237 F.2d 645, 646 (6th Cir. 1956). See also <em>Rosenbloom v. United States</em>, 355 U.S. 80 (1957) (permitting an extension). In two cases it has been held that no extension results from the failure to give notice of entry of judgments (as opposed to orders) since such notice is not required by Rule 49(d). <em>Wilkinson v. United States</em>, 278 F.2d 604 (10th Cir. 1960), cert. den. 363 U.S. 829; <em>Hyche v. United States</em>, 278 F.2d 915 (5th Cir. 1960), cert. den. 364 U.S. 881. The excusable neglect extension provision in Rule 37(a)(2) will cover most cases where failure of the clerk to give notice of judgments or orders has misled the defendant. No need appears for an indefinite extension without time limit beyond the 30 day period.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1968 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment corrects the reference to Rule 37(a)(2), the pertinent provisions of which are contained in Rule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">18 U.S.C. &sect;3575(a) and 21 U.S.C. &sect;849(a), dealing respectively with dangerous special offender sentencing and dangerous special drug offender sentencing, provide for the prosecutor to file notice of such status &ldquo;with the court&rdquo; and for the court to &ldquo;order the notice sealed&rdquo; under specified circumstances, but also declare that disclosure of this notice shall not be made &ldquo;to the presiding judge without the consent of the parties&rdquo; before verdict or plea of guilty or nolo contendere. It has been noted that these provisions are &ldquo;regrettably unclear as to where, in fact, such notice is to be filed&rdquo; and that possibly filing with the chief judge is contemplated. <em>United States v. Tramunti</em>, 377 F.Supp. 6 (S.D.N.Y. 1974). But such practice has been a matter of dispute when the chief judge would otherwise have been the presiding judge in the case, <em>United States v. Gaylor</em>, No. 80&ndash;5016 (4th Cir. 1981), and &ldquo;it does not solve the problem in those districts where there is only one federal district judge appointed,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Tramunti, supra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of subdivision (e) clarifies that the filing of such notice with the court is to be accomplished by filing with the clerk of the court, which is generally the procedure for filing with the court; see subdivision (d) of this rule. Except in a district having a single judge and no United States magistrate, the clerk will then, as provided in the second sentence, transmit the notice to the chief judge or to some other judge or a United States magistrate if the chief judge is scheduled to be the presiding judge in the case, so that the determination regarding sealing of the notice may be made without the disclosure prohibited by the aforementioned statutes. But in a district having a single judge and no United States magistrate this prohibition means the clerk may not disclose the notice to the court at all until the time specified by statute. The last sentence of subdivision (e) contemplates that in such instances the clerk will seal the notice if the case falls within the local rule describing when &ldquo;a public record may prejudice fair consideration of a pending criminal matter,&rdquo; the determination called for by the aforementioned statutes. The local rule might provide, for example, that the notice is to be sealed upon motion by any party.</p>

The direction that preference shall be given to criminal proceedings as far as practicable is generally recognized as desirable in the orderly administration of justice.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The addition to the rule proposed by subdivision (b) is designed to achieve the more prompt disposition of criminal cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">Preventing undue delay in the administration of criminal justice has become an object of increasing interest and concern. This is reflected in the Congress. See, e.g., 116 Cong.Rec. S7291&ndash;97 (daily ed. May 18, 1970) (remarks of Senator Ervin). Bills have been introduced fixing specific time limits. See S. 3936, H.R. 14822, H.R. 15888, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:160 --><p class="note-body">Proposals for dealing with the problem of delay have also been made by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Courts (1967) especially pp. 84&ndash;90, and by the American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Speedy Trial (Approved Draft, 1968). Both recommend specific time limits for each stage in the criminal process as the most effective way of achieving prompt disposition of criminal cases. See also Note, Nevada's 1967 Criminal Procedure Law from Arrest to Trial: One State's Response to a Widely Recognized Need, 1969 Utah L.Rev. 520, 542 no. 114.</p>
<p class="note-body">Historically, the right to a speedy trial has been thought of as a protection for the defendant. Delay can cause a hardship to a defendant who is in custody awaiting trial. Even if afforded the opportunity for pretrial release, a defendant nonetheless is likely to suffer anxiety during a period of unwanted delay, and he runs the risk that his memory and those of his witnesses may suffer as time goes on.</p>
<p class="note-body">Delay can also adversely affect the prosecution. Witnesses may lose interest or disappear or their memories may fade thus making them more vulnerable to cross-examination. See Note, The Right to a Speedy Criminal Trial, 57 Colum.L.Rev. 846 (1957).</p>
<p class="note-body">There is also a larger public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases which may transcend the interest of the particular prosecutor, defense counsel, and defendant. Thus there is need to try to expedite criminal cases even when both prosecution and defense may be willing to agree to a continuance or continuances. It has long been said that it is the certain and prompt imposition of a criminal sanction rather than its severity that has a significant deterring effect upon potential criminal conduct. See Banfield and Anderson, Continuances in the Cook County Criminal Courts, 35 U.Chi.L.Rev. 259, 259&ndash;63 (1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">Providing specific time limits for each stage of the criminal justice system is made difficult, particularly in federal courts, by the widely varying conditions which exist between the very busy urban districts on the one hand and the far less busy rural districts on the other hand. In the former, account must be taken of the extremely heavy caseload, and the prescription of relatively short time limits is realistic only if there is provided additional prosecutorial and judicial manpower. In some rural districts, the availability of a grand jury only twice a year makes unrealistic the provision of short time limits within which an indictment must be returned. This is not to say that prompt disposition of criminal cases cannot be achieved. It means only that the achieving of prompt disposition may require solutions which vary from district to district. Finding the best methods will require innovation and experimentation. To encourage this, the proposed draft mandates each district court to prepare a plan to achieve the prompt disposition of criminal cases in the district. The method prescribed for the development and approval of the district plans is comparable to that prescribed in the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1863(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Each plan shall include rules which specify time limits and a means for reporting the status of criminal cases. The appropriate length of the time limits is left to the discretion of the individual district courts. This permits each district court to establish time limits that are appropriate in light of its criminal caseload, frequency of grand jury meetings, and any other factors which affect the progress of criminal actions. Where local conditions exist which contribute to delay, it is contemplated that appropriate efforts will be made to eliminate those conditions. For example, experience in some rural districts demonstrates that grand juries can be kept on call thus eliminating the grand jury as a cause for prolonged delay. Where manpower shortage is a major cause for delay, adequate solutions will require congressional action. But the development and analysis of the district plans should disclose where manpower shortages exist; how large the shortages are; and what is needed, in the way of additional manpower, to achieve the prompt disposition of criminal cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The district court plans must contain special provision for prompt disposition of cases in which there is reason to believe that the pretrial liberty of a defendant poses danger to himself, to any other person, or to the community. Prompt disposition of criminal cases may provide an alternative to the pretrial detention of potentially dangerous defendants. See 116 Cong.Rec. S7291&ndash;97 (daily ed. May 18, 1970) (remarks of Senator Ervin). Prompt disposition of criminal cases in which the defendant is held in pretrial detention would ensure that the deprivation of liberty prior to conviction would be minimized.</p>
<p class="note-body">Approval of the original plan and any subsequent modification must be obtained from a reviewing panel made up of one judge from the district submitting the plan (either the chief judge or another active judge appointed by him) and the members of the judicial council of the circuit. The makeup of this reviewing panel is the same as that provided by the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. &sect;1863(a). This reviewing panel is also empowered to direct the modification of a district court plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently adopted a set of rules for the prompt disposition of criminal cases. See 8 Cr.L. 2251 (Jan. 13, 1971). These rules, effective July 5, 1971, provide time limits for the early trial of high risk defendants, for court control over the granting of continuances, for criteria to control continuance practice, and for sanction against the prosecution or defense in the event of noncompliance with prescribed time limits.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment designates the first paragraph of Rule 50 as subdivision (a) entitled &ldquo;Calendars,&rdquo; in view of the recent addition of subdivision (b) to the rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1976 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment to rule 50(b) takes account of the enactment of The Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3152&ndash;3156, 3161&ndash;3174. As the various provisions of the Act take effect, see 18 U.S.C. &sect;3163, they and the district plans adopted pursuant thereto will supplant the plans heretofore adopted under rule 50(b). The first such plan must be prepared and submitted by each district court before July 1, 1976. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3165(e)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">That part of rule 50(b) which sets out the necessary contents of district plans has been deleted, as the somewhat different contents of the plans required by the Act are enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3166. That part of rule 50(b) which describes the manner in which district plans are to be submitted, reviewed, modified and reported upon has also been deleted, for these provisions now appear in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3165(c) and (d).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 50 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence in current Rule 50(a), which says that a court may place criminal proceedings on a calendar, has been deleted. The Committee believed that the sentence simply stated a truism and was no longer necessary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:161 --><p class="note-body">Current Rule 50(b), which simply mirrors 18 U.S.C. &sect;3165, has been deleted in its entirety. The rule was added in 1971 to meet congressional concerns in pending legislation about deadlines in criminal cases. Provisions governing deadlines were later enacted by Congress and protections were provided in the Speedy Trial Act. The Committee concluded that in light of those enactments, Rule 50(b) was no longer necessary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Exceptions Unnecessary.</strong> Exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Preserving a Claim of Error.</strong> A party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court&mdash;when the court ruling or order is made or sought&mdash;of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action and the grounds for that objection. If a party does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence of an objection does not later prejudice that party.

<p class="note-body">1. This rule is practically identical with Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. It relates to a matter of trial practice which should be the same in civil and criminal cases in the interest of avoiding confusion. The corresponding civil rule has been construed in <em>Ulm v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc</em>., 115 F.2d 492 (C.C.A. 2d), and <em>Bucy v. Nevada Construction Company</em>, 125 F.2d 213, 218 (C.C.A. 9th). See, also, Orfield, 22 Texas L.R. 194, 221. As to the method of taking objections to instructions to the jury, see Rule 30.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Many States have abolished the use of exceptions in criminal and civil cases. See, e.g., Cal.Pen. Code (Deering, 1941), sec. 1259; Mich.Stat.Ann. (Henderson, 1938), secs. 28.1046, 28.1053; Ohio Gen Code Ann. (Page, 1938), secs. 11560, 13442&ndash;7; Oreg.Comp. Laws Ann. (1940), secs. 5&ndash;704, 26&ndash;1001.</p>

<p class="note-body">Although the word &ldquo;radio&rdquo; has been deleted from the rule, the Committee does not believe that the amendment is a substantive change but rather one that accords with judicial interpretation applying the current rule to other forms of broadcasting and functionally equivalent means. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hastings</em>, 695 F.2d 1278, 1279, n. 5 (11th Cir. 1983) (television proceedings prohibited); <em>United States v. McVeigh</em>, 931 F. Supp. 753 (D. Colo. 1996) (release of tape recordings of proceedings prohibited). Given modern technology capabilities, the Committee believed that a more generalized reference to &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; is appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, although the revised rule does not explicitly recognize exceptions within the rules themselves, the restyled rule recognizes that other rules might permit, for example, video teleconferencing, which clearly involves &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; of the proceedings, even if only for limited purposes.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 79 [28 U.S.C., Appendix], prescribed in detail the books and records to be kept by the clerk in civil cases. Subsequently to the effective date of the civil rules, however, the Act establishing the Administrative Office of the United States Courts became law (Act of August 7, 1939; 53 Stat. 1223; 28 U.S.C. 444&ndash;450 [now 332&ndash;333, 456, 601&ndash;610]). One of the duties of the Director of that Office is to have charge, under the supervision and direction of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, of all administrative matters relating to the offices of the clerks and other clerical and administrative personnel of the courts, 28 U.S.C. 446 [now 604, 609]. In view of this circumstance it seemed best not to prescribe the records to be kept by the clerks of the district courts and by the United States commissioners, in criminal proceedings, but to vest the power to do so in the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with the approval of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges.</p>

The amendment will make it possible for the Director to permit use of more sophisticated record-keeping techniques, including those which may obviate the need for a &ldquo;criminal docket&rdquo; book.

In particular, the major purpose of the reformulation is to enhance the local rulemaking process by requiring appropriate public notice of proposed rules and an opportunity to comment on them. See Committee Note to Fed.R.Civ.P. 83.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. This rule is amended to reflect the requirement that local rules be consistent not only with the national rules but also with Acts of Congress. The amendment also states that local rules should not repeat national rules and Acts of Congress.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:164 --><p class="note-body">The amendment also requires that the numbering of local rules conform with any numbering system that may be prescribed by the Judicial Conference. Lack of uniform numbering might create unnecessary traps for counsel and litigants. A uniform numbering system would make it easier for an increasingly national bar to locate a local rule that applies to a particular procedural issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) is new. Its aim is to protect against loss of rights in the enforcement of local rules relating to matters of form. The proscription of paragraph (2) is narrowly drawn&mdash;covering only nonwillful violations and only those involving local rules directed to matters of form. It does not limit the court's power to impose substantive penalties upon a party if it or its attorney stubbornly or repeatedly violates a local rule, even one involving merely a matter of form. Nor does it affect the court's power to enforce local rules that involve more than mere matters of form&mdash;for example, a local rule requiring that the defendant waive a jury trial within a specified time.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. This rule provides flexibility to the court in regulating practice when there is no controlling law. Specifically, it permits the court to regulate practice in any manner consistent with Acts of Congress, with rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2072, and with the district's local rules. This rule recognizes that courts rely on multiple directives to control practice. Some courts regulate practice through the published Federal Rules and the local rules of the court. Some courts also have used internal operating procedures, standing orders, and other internal directives. Although such directives continue to be authorized, they can lead to problems. Counsel or litigants may be unaware of the various directives. In addition, the sheer volume of directives may impose an unreasonable barrier. For example, it may be difficult to obtain copies of the directives. Finally, counsel or litigants may be unfairly sanctioned for failing to comply with a directive. For these reasons, the amendment disapproves imposing any sanction or other disadvantage on a person for noncompliance with such an internal directive, unless the alleged violator has been furnished in a particular case with actual notice of the requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">There should be no adverse consequence to a party or attorney for violating special requirements relating to practice before a particular judge unless the party or attorney has actual notice of those requirements. Furnishing litigants with a copy outlining the judge's practices&mdash;or attaching instructions to a notice setting a case for conference or trial&mdash;would suffice to give actual notice, as would an order in a case specifically adopting by reference a judge's standing order and indicating how copies can be obtained.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 57 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 58. Petty Offenses and Other Misdemeanors</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Scope.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> These rules apply in petty offense and other misdemeanor cases and on appeal to a district judge in a case tried by a magistrate judge, unless this rule provides otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Petty Offense Case Without Imprisonment.</em></strong> In a case involving a petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed, the court may follow any provision of these rules that is not inconsistent with this rule and that the court considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Definition.</em></strong> As used in this rule, the term &ldquo;petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed&rdquo; means a petty offense for which the court determines that, in the event of conviction, no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pretrial Procedure.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>Charging Document.</em></strong> The trial of a misdemeanor may proceed on an indictment, information, or complaint. The trial of a petty offense may also proceed on a citation or violation notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Initial Appearance.</em></strong> At the defendant's initial appearance on a petty offense or other misdemeanor charge, the magistrate judge must inform the defendant of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the charge, and the minimum and maximum penalties, including imprisonment, fines, any special assessment under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3013, and restitution under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3556;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the right to retain counsel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the right to request the appointment of counsel if the defendant is unable to retain counsel&mdash;unless the charge is a petty offense for which the appointment of counsel is not required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the defendant's right not to make a statement, and that any statement made may be used against the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the right to trial, judgment, and sentencing before a district judge&mdash;unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the charge is a petty offense; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the defendant consents to trial, judgment, and sentencing before a magistrate judge;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the right to a jury trial before either a magistrate judge or a district judge&mdash;unless the charge is a petty offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) if the defendant is held in custody and charged with a misdemeanor other than a petty offense, the right to a preliminary hearing under Rule 5.1, and the general circumstances, if any, under which the defendant may secure pretrial release.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Arraignment.</em></strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Plea Before a Magistrate Judge</em>. A magistrate judge may take the defendant's plea in a petty offense case. In every other misdemeanor case, a magistrate judge may take the plea only if the defendant consents either in writing or on the record to be tried before a magistrate judge and specifically waives trial before a district judge. The defendant may plead not guilty, guilty, or (with the consent of the magistrate judge) nolo contendere.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Failure to Consent</em>. Except in a petty offense case, the magistrate judge must order a defendant who does not consent to trial before a magistrate judge to appear before a district judge for further proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Additional Procedures in Certain Petty Offense Cases.</strong> The following procedures also apply in a case involving a petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>Guilty or Nolo Contendere Plea.</em></strong> The court must not accept a guilty or nolo contendere plea unless satisfied that the defendant understands the nature of the charge and the maximum possible penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Waiving Venue.</em></strong></p>
<!-- PDFPage:165 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Conditions of Waiving Venue</em>. If a defendant is arrested, held, or present in a district different from the one where the indictment, information, complaint, citation, or violation notice is pending, the defendant may state in writing a desire to plead guilty or nolo contendere; to waive venue and trial in the district where the proceeding is pending; and to consent to the court's disposing of the case in the district where the defendant was arrested, is held, or is present.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Effect of Waiving Venue</em>. Unless the defendant later pleads not guilty, the prosecution will proceed in the district where the defendant was arrested, is held, or is present. The district clerk must notify the clerk in the original district of the defendant's waiver of venue. The defendant's statement of a desire to plead guilty or nolo contendere is not admissible against the defendant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Sentencing.</em></strong> The court must give the defendant an opportunity to be heard in mitigation and then proceed immediately to sentencing. The court may, however, postpone sentencing to allow the probation service to investigate or to permit either party to submit additional information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) <em>Notice of a Right to Appeal.</em></strong> After imposing sentence in a case tried on a not-guilty plea, the court must advise the defendant of a right to appeal the conviction and of any right to appeal the sentence. If the defendant was convicted on a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Paying a Fixed Sum in Lieu of Appearance.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> If the court has a local rule governing forfeiture of collateral, the court may accept a fixed-sum payment in lieu of the defendant's appearance and end the case, but the fixed sum may not exceed the maximum fine allowed by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Notice to Appear.</em></strong> If the defendant fails to pay a fixed sum, request a hearing, or appear in response to a citation or violation notice, the district clerk or a magistrate judge may issue a notice for the defendant to appear before the court on a date certain. The notice may give the defendant an additional opportunity to pay a fixed sum in lieu of appearance. The district clerk must serve the notice on the defendant by mailing a copy to the defendant's last known address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Summons or Warrant.</em></strong> Upon an indictment, or upon a showing by one of the other charging documents specified in Rule 58(b)(1) of probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, the court may issue an arrest warrant or, if no warrant is requested by an attorney for the government, a summons. The showing of probable cause must be made under oath or under penalty of perjury, but the affiant need not appear before the court. If the defendant fails to appear before the court in response to a summons, the court may summarily issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Recording the Proceedings.</strong> The court must record any proceedings under this rule by using a court reporter or a suitable recording device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) New Trial.</strong> Rule 33 applies to a motion for a new trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Appeal.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>From a District Judge's Order or Judgment. </em></strong>The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure govern an appeal from a district judge's order or a judgment of conviction or sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>From a Magistrate Judge's Order or Judgment.</em></strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Interlocutory Appeal</em>. Either party may appeal an order of a magistrate judge to a district judge within 10 days of its entry if a district judge's order could similarly be appealed. The party appealing must file a notice with the clerk specifying the order being appealed and must serve a copy on the adverse party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Appeal from a Conviction or Sentence</em>. A defendant may appeal a magistrate judge's judgment of conviction or sentence to a district judge within 10 days of its entry. To appeal, the defendant must file a notice with the clerk specifying the judgment being appealed and must serve a copy on an attorney for the government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Record</em>. The record consists of the original papers and exhibits in the case; any transcript, tape, or other recording of the proceedings; and a certified copy of the docket entries. For purposes of the appeal, a copy of the record of the proceedings must be made available to a defendant who establishes by affidavit an inability to pay or give security for the record. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts must pay for those copies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Scope of Appeal</em>. The defendant is not entitled to a trial de novo by a district judge. The scope of the appeal is the same as in an appeal to the court of appeals from a judgment entered by a district judge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Stay of Execution and Release Pending Appeal. </em></strong>Rule 38 applies to a stay of a judgment of conviction or sentence. The court may release the defendant pending appeal under the law relating to release pending appeal from a district court to a court of appeals.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1990</h4>
<p class="note-body">This new rule is largely a restatement of the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Misdemeanors before United States Magistrates which were promulgated in 1980 to replace the Rules for the Trial of Minor Offenses before United States Magistrates (1970). The Committee believed that a new single rule should be incorporated into the Rules of Criminal Procedure where those charged with its execution could readily locate it and realize its relationship with the other Rules. A number of technical changes have been made throughout the rule and unless otherwise noted, no substantive changes were intended in those amendments. The Committee envisions no major changes in the way in which the trial of misdemeanors and petty offenses are currently handled.</p>
<p class="note-body">The title of the rule has been changed by deleting the phrase &ldquo;Before United States Magistrates&rdquo; to indicate that this rule may be used by district judges as well as magistrates. The phrase &ldquo;and Petty Offenses&rdquo; has been <!-- PDFPage:166 -->added to the title and elsewhere throughout the rule because the term &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; does not include an &ldquo;infraction.&rdquo; <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3559(a). A petty offense, however, is defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect;19 as a Class B misdemeanor, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction, with limitations on fines of no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for an organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is an amended version of current Magistrates Rule 1. Deletion of the phrase &ldquo;before United States Magistrates under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401&rdquo; in Rule 1(a) will enable district judges to use the abbreviated procedures of this rule. Consistent with that change, the term &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; is amended to read &ldquo;the court,&rdquo; wherever appropriate throughout the rule, to indicate that both judges and magistrates may use the rule. The last sentence in (a)(1) has been amended to reflect that the rule also governs an appeal from a magistrate's decision to a judge of the district court. An appeal from a district judge's decision would be governed by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Subdivision (a)(2) rephrases prior language in Magistrate Rule 1(b). Subdivision (a)(3) adds a statutory reference to 18 U.S.C. &sect;19, which defines a petty offense as a &ldquo;Class B misdemeanor, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction&rdquo; with the $5,000 and $10,000 fine limitations noted <em>supra</em>. The phrase &ldquo;regardless of the penalty authorized by law&rdquo; has been deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is an amended version of current Magistrates Rule 2. The last sentence in current Rule 2(a) has been deleted because 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(a), provides that a magistrate will have jurisdiction to try misdemeanor cases when specially designated to do so by the district court or courts served by the Magistrate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)</em> reflects the standard rights advisements currently included in Magistrates Rule 2 with several amendments. Subdivision (b)(2)(A) specifically requires that the defendant be advised of all penalties which may be imposed upon conviction, including specifically a special assessment and restitution. A number of technical, nonsubstantive, changes have been made in the contents of advisement of rights. A substantive change is reflected in subdivision (b)(2)(G), currently Magistrates Rule 2(b)(7), and (8). That rule currently provides that, unless the prosecution is on an indictment or information, a defendant who is charged with a misdemeanor other than a petty offense has a right to a preliminary hearing, if the defendant does not consent to be tried by the magistrate. As amended, only a defendant in custody has a right to a preliminary hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3)(A)</em> is based upon Magistrates Rule 2(c) and has been amended by deleting the last sentence, which provides that trial may occur within 30 days &ldquo;upon written consent of the defendant.&rdquo; The change is warranted because the Speedy Trial Act does not apply to petty offenses. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3172(2). Subdivision (b)(3)(B), &ldquo;Failure to Consent,&rdquo; currently appears in Magistrates Rule 3(a). The first sentence has been amended to make it applicable to all misdemeanor and petty offense defendants who fail to consent. The last sentence of Rule 3(a) has been deleted entirely. Because the clerk is responsible for all district court case files, including those for misdemeanor and petty offense cases tried by magistrates, it is not necessary to state that the file be transmitted to the clerk of court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is an amended version of current Magistrates Rule 3 with the exception of Rule 3(a), which, as noted <em>supra</em> is now located in subdivision (b)(3)(B) of the new rule. The phrase &ldquo;petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed&rdquo; has been deleted because the heading for subdivision (c) limits its application to those petty offenses. The Committee recognizes that subdivision (c)(2) might result in attempted forum shopping. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shaw</em>, 467 F. Supp. 86 (W.D. La. 1979), <em>affm'd</em>, 615 F. 2d 251 (5th Cir. 1980). In order to maintain a streamlined and less formal procedure which is consistent with the remainder of the Rule, subdivision (c)(2) does not require the formal &ldquo;consent&rdquo; of the United States Attorneys involved before a waiver of venue may be accomplished. <em>Cf</em>. Rule 20 (Transfer From the District for Plea and Sentence). The Rule specifically envisions that there will be communication and coordination between the two districts involved. To that end, reasonable efforts should be made to contact the United States Attorney in the district in which the charges were instituted. Subdivision (c)(4), formerly Rule 3(d), now specifically provides that the defendant be advised of the right to appeal the sentence. This subdivision is also amended to provide for advising the defendant of the right to appeal a sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act when the defendant is sentenced following a plea of guilty. Both amendments track the language of Rule 32(a)(2), as amended by the Sentencing Reform Act.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is an amended version of Magistrates Rule 4. The amendments are technical in nature and no substantive change is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> consists of the first sentence of Magistrates Rule 5. The second sentence of that Rule was deleted as being inconsistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;753(b) which gives the court discretion to decide how the proceedings will be recorded. The third sentence is deleted to preclude routine waivers of a verbatim record and to insure that all petty offenses are recorded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em> replaces Magistrates Rule 6 and simply incorporates by reference Rule 33.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> is an amended version of Magistrates Rule 7. Because the new rule may be used by both magistrates and judges, subdivision (g)(1) was added to make it clear that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure govern any appeal in a case tried by a district judge pursuant to the new rule. Subdivision (g)(2)(B), based upon Magistrates Rule 7(b), now provides for appeal of a sentence by a magistrate and is thus consistent with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3742(f). Finally, subdivision (g)(3) is based upon Magistrates Rule 7(d) but has been amended to provide that a stay of execution is applicable, if an appeal is taken from a sentence as well as from a conviction. This change is consistent with the recent amendment of Rule 38 by the Sentencing Reform Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new rule does not include Magistrates Rules 8 and 9. Rule 8 has been deleted because the subject of local rules is covered in Rule 57. Rule 9, which defined a petty offense, is now covered in 18 U.S.C. &sect;19.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive changes are intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Sec. 202, amended 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(b) and 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(a) to remove the requirement that a defendant must consent to a trial before a magistrate judge in a petty offense that is a class B misdemeanor charging a motor vehicle offense, a class C misdemeanor, or an infraction. Section 202 also changed 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(b) to provide that in all other misdemeanor cases, the defendant may consent to trial either orally on the record or in writing. The amendments to Rule 58(b)(2) and (3) conform the rule to the new statutory language and include minor stylistic changes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 58 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and <!-- PDFPage:167 -->terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">The title of the rule has been changed to &ldquo;Petty Offenses and Other Misdemeanors.&rdquo; In Rule 58(c)(2)(B) (regarding waiver of venue), the Committee amended the rule to require that the &ldquo;district clerk,&rdquo; instead of the magistrate judge, inform the original district clerk if the defendant waives venue and the prosecution proceeds in the district where the defendant was arrested. The Committee intends no change in practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">In Rule 58(g)(1) and (g)(2)(A), the Committee deleted as unnecessary the word &ldquo;decision&rdquo; because its meaning is covered by existing references to an &ldquo;order, judgment, or sentence&rdquo; by a district judge or magistrate judge. In the Committee's view, deletion of that term does not amount to a substantive change.</p>
