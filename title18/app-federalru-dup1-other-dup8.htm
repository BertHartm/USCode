<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Appearance Before Federal Magistrate Judge</cap-smallcap>. If a person is arrested in a district other than that in which the offense is alleged to have been committed, that person shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 5. Preliminary proceedings concerning the defendant shall be conducted in accordance with Rules 5 and 5.1, except that if no preliminary examination is held because an indictment has been returned or an information filed or because the defendant elects to have the preliminary examination conducted in the district in which the prosecution is pending, the person shall be held to answer upon a finding that such person is the person named in the indictment, information or warrant. If held to answer, the defendant shall be held to answer in the district court in which the prosecution is pending&mdash;provided that a warrant is issued in that district if the arrest was made without a warrant&mdash;upon production of the warrant or a certified copy thereof. The warrant or certified copy may be produced by facsimile transmission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement by Federal Magistrate Judge</cap-smallcap>. In addition to the statements required by Rule 5, the federal magistrate judge shall inform the defendant of the provisions of Rule 20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Papers</cap-smallcap>. If a defendant is held or discharged, the papers in the proceeding and any bail taken shall be transmitted to the clerk of the district court in which the prosecution is pending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Arrest of Probationer or Supervised Releasee</cap-smallcap>. If a person is arrested for a violation of probation or supervised release in a district other than the district having jurisdiction, such person must be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge. The person may be released under Rule 46(c). The federal magistrate judge shall:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Proceed under Rule 32.1 if jurisdiction over the person is transferred to that district;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Hold a prompt preliminary hearing if the alleged violation occurred in that district, and either (i) hold the person to answer in the district court of the district having jurisdiction or (ii) dismiss the proceedings and so notify that court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Otherwise order the person held to answer in the district court of the district having jurisdiction upon production of certified copies of the judgment, the warrant, and the application for the warrant, and upon a finding that the person before the magistrate judge is the person named in the warrant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Arrest for Failure To Appear</cap-smallcap>. If a person is arrested on a warrant in a district other than that in which the warrant was issued, and the warrant was issued because of the failure of the person named therein to appear as required pursuant to a subpoena or the terms of that person's release, the person arrested must be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge. Upon produc<!-- PDFPage:121 -->tion of the warrant or a certified copy thereof and upon a finding that the person before the magistrate judge is the person named in the warrant, the federal magistrate judge shall hold the person to answer in the district in which the warrant was issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Release or Detention</cap-smallcap>. If a person was previously detained or conditionally released, pursuant to chapter 207 of title 18, United States Code, in another district where a warrant, information, or indictment issued, the federal magistrate judge shall take into account the decision previously made and the reasons set forth therefor, if any, but will not be bound by that decision. If the federal magistrate judge amends the release or detention decision or alters the conditions of release, the magistrate judge shall set forth the reasons therefor in writing.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. This rule modifies and revamps existing procedure. The present practice has developed as a result of a series of judicial decisions, the only statute dealing with the subject being exceedingly general, 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial):</p>
<p class="note-body">For any crime or offense against the United States, the offender may, by any justice or judge of the United States, or by any United States commissioner, or by any chancellor, judge of a supreme or superior court, chief or first judge of common pleas, mayor of a city, justice of the peace, or other magistrate, of any State where he may be found, and agreeably to the usual mode of process against offenders in such State, and at the expense of the United States, be arrested and imprisoned, or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offense. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Where any offender or witness is committed in any district other than that where the offense is to be tried, it shall be the duty of the judge of the district where such offender or witness is imprisoned, seasonably to issue, and of the marshal to execute, a warrant for his removal to the district where the trial is to be had.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The scope of a removal hearing, the issues to be considered, and other similar matters are governed by judicial decisions, <em>Beavers v. Henkel</em>, 194 U.S. 73; <em>Tinsley v. Treat</em>, 205 U.S. 20; <em>Henry v. Henkel</em>, 235 U.S. 219; <em>Rodman v. Pothier</em>, 264 U.S. 399; <em>Morse v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 80; <em>Fetters v. United States ex rel. Cunningham</em>, 283 U.S. 638; <em>United States ex rel. Kassin v. Mulligan</em>, 295 U.S. 396; see, also, 9 Edmunds, Cyclopedia of Federal Procedure 39053, <em>et seq.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">2. The purpose of removal proceedings is to accord safeguards to a defendant against an improvident removal to a distant point for trial. On the other hand, experience has shown that removal proceedings have at times been used by defendants for dilatory purposes and in attempting to frustrate prosecution by preventing or postponing transportation even as between adjoining districts and between places a few miles apart. The object of the rule is adequately to meet each of these two situations.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. For the purposes of removal, all cases in which the accused is apprehended in a district other than that in which the prosecution is pending have been divided into two groups: first, those in which the place of arrest is either in another district of the same State, or if in another State, then less than 100 miles from the place where the prosecution is pending; and second, cases in which the arrest occurs in a State other than that in which the prosecution is pending and the place of arrest is 100 miles or more distant from the latter place.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the first group of cases, removal proceedings are abolished. The defendant's right to the usual preliminary hearing is, of course, preserved, but the committing magistrate, if he holds defendant would bind him over to the district court in which the prosecution is pending. As ordinarily there are no removal proceedings in State prosecutions as between different parts of the same State, but the accused is transported by virtue of the process under which he was arrested, it seems reasonable that no removal proceedings should be required in the Federal courts as between districts in the same State. The provision as to arrest in another State but at a place less than 100 miles from the place where the prosecution is pending was added in order to preclude obstruction against bringing the defendant a short distance for trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the second group of cases mentioned in the first paragraph, removal proceedings are continued. The practice to be followed in removal hearings will depend on whether the demand for removal is based upon an indictment or upon an information or complaint. In the latter case, proof of identity and proof of reasonable cause to believe the defendant guilty will have to be adduced in order to justify the issuance of a warrant of removal. In the former case, proof of identity coupled with a certified copy of the indictment will be sufficient, as the indictment will be conclusive proof of probable cause. The distinction is based on the fact that in case of an indictment, the grand jury, which is an arm of the court, has already found probable cause. Since the action of the grand jury is not subject to review by a district judge in the district in which the grand jury sits, it seems illogical to permit such review collaterally in a removal proceeding by a judge in another district.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. For discussions of this rule see, Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 654, 656; Holtzoff, 3 F.R.D. 445, 450&ndash;452; Holtzoff, 12 George Washington L.R. 119, 127&ndash;130; Holtzoff, The Federal Bar Journal, October 1944, 18&ndash;37; Berge, 42 Mich.L.R. 353, 374; Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 4.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). The rule provides that all removal hearings shall take place before a United States commissioner or a Federal judge. It does not confer such jurisdiction on State or local magistrates. While theoretically under existing law State and local magistrates have authority to conduct removal hearings, nevertheless as a matter of universal practice, such proceedings are always conducted before a United States commissioner or a Federal judge, 9 Edmunds, Cyclopedia of Federal Procedure 3919.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment conforms to the change made in the corresponding procedure in Rule 5(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to make clear that the person shall be taken before the federal magistrate &ldquo;without unnecessary delay.&rdquo; Although the former rule was silent in this regard, it probably would have been interpreted to require prompt appearance, and there is therefore advantage in making this explicit in the rule itself. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;652 (1969, Supp. 1971). Subdivision (a) is amended to also make clear that the person is to be brought before a &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; rather than a state or local magistrate authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041. The former rules were inconsistent in this regard. Although rule 40(a) provided that the person may be brought before a state or local officer authorized by <!-- PDFPage:122 -->former rule 5(a), such state or local officer lacks authority to conduct a preliminary examination under rule 5(c), and a principal purpose of the appearance is to hold a preliminary examination where no prior indictment or information has issued. The Federal Magistrates Act should make it possible to bring a person before a federal magistrate. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;653, especially n.35 (1969, Supp. 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to provide that the federal magistrate should inform the defendant of the fact that he may avail himself of the provisions of rule 20 if applicable in the particular case. However, the failure to so notify the defendant should not invalidate the removal procedure. Although the old rule is silent in this respect, it is current practice to so notify the defendant, and it seems desirable, therefore, to make this explicit in the rule itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that an order of removal under subdivision (b)(3) can be made only by a judge of the United States and cannot be made by a United States magistrate is retained. However, subdivision (b)(5) authorizes issuance of the warrant of removal by a United States magistrate if he is authorized to do so by a rule of district court adopted in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b):</p>
<p class="note-body">Any district court *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may establish rules pursuant to which any full-time United States magistrate *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may be assigned *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although former rule 40(b)(3) required that the warrant of removal be issued by a judge of the United States, there appears no constitutional or statutory prohibition against conferring this authority upon a United States magistrate in accordance with 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(b). The background history is dealt with in detail in 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;40.01 and 40.02 (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(4) makes explicit reference to provisions of the Bail Reform Act of 1966 by incorporating a cross-reference to 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146 and &sect;3148.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This substantial revision of rule 40 abolishes the present distinction between arrest in a nearby district and arrest in a distant district, clarifies the authority of the magistrate with respect to the setting of bail where bail had previously been fixed in the other district, adds a provision dealing with arrest of a probationer in a district other than the district of supervision, and adds a provision dealing with arrest of a defendant or witness for failure to appear in another district.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). Under subdivision (a) of the present rule, if a person is arrested in a nearby district (another district in the same state, or a place less than 100 miles away), the usual rule 5 and 5.1 preliminary proceedings are conducted. But under subdivision (b) of the present rule, if a person is arrested in a distant district, then a hearing leading to a warrant of removal is held. New subdivision (a) would make no distinction between these two situations and would provide for rule 5 and 5.1 proceedings in all instances in which the arrest occurs outside the district where the warrant issues or where the offense is alleged to have been committed.</p>
<p class="note-body">This abolition of the distinction between arrest in a nearby district and arrest in a distant district rests upon the conclusion that the procedures prescribed in rules 5 and 5.1 are adequate to protect the rights of an arrestee wherever he might be arrested. If the arrest is without a warrant, it is necessary under rule 5 that a complaint be filed forthwith complying with the requirements of rule 4(a) with respect to the showing of probable cause. If the arrest is with a warrant, that warrant will have been issued upon the basis of an indictment or of a complaint or information showing probable cause, pursuant to rules 4(a) and 9(a). Under rule 5.1 dealing with the preliminary examination, the defendant is to be held to answer only upon a showing of probable cause that an offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (a), there are two situations in which no preliminary examination will be held. One is where &ldquo;an indictment has been returned or an information filed,&rdquo; which pursuant to rule 5(c) obviates the need for a preliminary examination. The order is where &ldquo;the defendant elects to have the preliminary examination conducted in the district in which the prosecution is pending.&rdquo; A defendant might wish to elect that alternative when, for example, the law in that district is that the complainant and other material witnesses may be required to appear at the preliminary examination and give testimony. See <em>Washington v. Clemmer</em>, 339 F.2d 715 (D.C. Cir. 1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (a) continues the present requirement that if the arrest was without a warrant a warrant must thereafter issue in the district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed. This will ensure that in the district of anticipated prosecution there will have been a probable cause determination by a magistrate or grand jury.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). New subdivision (b) follows existing subdivision (b)(2) in requiring the magistrate to inform the defendant of the provisions of rule 20 applicable in the particular case. Failure to so notify the defendant should not invalidate the proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). New subdivision (c) follows existing subdivision (b)(4) as to transmittal of papers.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). New subdivision (d) has no counterpart in the present rule. It provides a procedure for dealing with the situation in which a probationer is arrested in a district other than the district of supervision, consistent with 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653, which provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">If the probationer shall be arrested in any district other than that in which he was last supervised, he shall be returned to the district in which the warrant was issued, unless jurisdiction over him is transferred as above provided to the district in which he is found, and in that case he shall be detained pending further proceedings in such district.</p>
<p class="note-body">One possibility, provided for in subdivision (d)(1), is that of transferring jurisdiction over the probationer to the district in which he was arrested. This is permissible under the aforementioned statute, which provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Whenever during the period of his probation, a probationer heretofore or hereafter placed on probation, goes from the district in which he is being supervised to another district, jurisdiction over him may be transferred, in the discretion of the court, from the court for the district from which he goes to the court for the other district, with the concurrence of the latter court. Thereupon the court for the district to which jurisdiction is transferred shall have all power with respect to the probationer that was previously possessed by the court for the district from which the transfer is made, except that the period of probation shall not be changed without the consent of the sentencing court. This process under the same conditions may be repeated whenever during the period of this probation the probationer goes from the district in which he is being supervised to another district.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Such transfer may be particularly appropriate when it is found that the probationer has now taken up residence in the district where he was arrested or where the alleged occurrence deemed to constitute a violation of probation took place in the district of arrest. In current practice, probationers arrested in a district other than that of their present supervision are sometimes unnecessarily returned to the district of their supervision, at considerable expense and loss of time, when the more appropriate course of action would have been transfer of probation jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(2) and (3) deal with the situation in which there is not a transfer of probation jurisdiction <!-- PDFPage:123 -->to the district of arrest. If the alleged probation violation occurred in the district of arrest, then, under subdivision (d)(2), the preliminary hearing provided for in rule 32.1(a)(1) is to be held in that district. This is consistent with the reasoning in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), made applicable to probation cases in <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli</em>, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), where the Court stressed that often a parolee &ldquo;is arrested at a place distant from the state institution, to which he may be returned before the final decision is made concerning revocation,&rdquo; and cited this as a factor contributing to the conclusion that due process requires &ldquo;that some minimal inquiry be conducted at or reasonably near the place of the alleged parole violation or arrest and as promptly as convenient after arrest while information is fresh and sources are available.&rdquo; As later noted in <em>Gerstein v. Pugh</em>, 420 U.S. 103 (1975):</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">In <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli</em> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* we held that a parolee or probationer arrested prior to revocation is entitled to an informal preliminary hearing at the place of arrest, with some provision for live testimony. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* That preliminary hearing, more than the probable cause determination required by the Fourth Amendment, serves the purpose of gathering and preserving live testimony, since the final revocation hearing frequently is held at some distance from the place where the violation occurred.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, if the alleged violation did not occur in that district, then first-hand testimony concerning the violation is unlikely to be available there, and thus the reasoning of <em>Morrissey</em> and <em>Gerstein</em> does not call for holding the preliminary hearing in that district. In such a case, as provided in subdivision (d)(3), the probationer should be held to answer in the district court of the district having probation jurisdiction. The purpose of the proceeding there provided for is to ascertain the identity of the probationer and provide him with copies of the warrant and the application for the warrant. A probationer is subject to the reporting condition at all times and is also subject to the continuing power of the court to modify such conditions. He therefore stands subject to return back to the jurisdiction district without the necessity of conducting a hearing in the district of arrest to determine whether there is probable cause to revoke his probation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). New subdivision (e) has no counterpart in the present rule. It has been added because some confusion currently exists as to whether present rule 40(b) is applicable to the case in which a bench warrant has issued for the return of a defendant or witness who has absented himself and that person is apprehended in a distant district. In <em>Bandy v. United States</em>, 408 F.2d 518 (8th Cir. 1969), a defendant, who had been released upon his personal recognizance after conviction and while petitioning for certiorari and who failed to appear as required after certiorari was denied, objected to his later arrest in New York and removal to Leavenworth without compliance with the rule 40 procedures. The court concluded:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The short answer to <em>Bandy's</em> first argument is found in <em>Rush v. United States</em>, 290 F.2d 709, 710 (5 Cir. 1961): &ldquo;The provisions of Rules 5 and 40, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. may not be availed of by a prisoner in escape status&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; As noted by Holtzoff, &ldquo;Removal of Defendants in Federal Criminal Procedure&rdquo;, 4 F.R.D. 455, 458 (1946):</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;Resort need not be had, however, to this [removal] procedure for the purpose of returning a prisoner who has been recaptured after an escape from custody. It has been pointed out that in such a case the court may summarily direct his return under its general power to issue writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction and agreeable to the usages and principles of law. In fact, in such a situation no judicial process appears necessary. The prisoner may be retaken and administratively returned to the custody from which he escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Bandy's arrest in New York was pursuant to a bench warrant issued by the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota on May 1, 1962, when Bandy failed to surrender himself to commence service of his sentence on the conviction for filing false income tax refunds. As a fugitive from justice, Bandy was not entitled upon apprehension to a removal hearing, and he was properly removed to the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas to commence service of sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Consistent with Bandy, new subdivision (e) does not afford such a person all of the protections provided for in subdivision (a). However, subdivision (e) does ensure that a determination of identity will be made before that person is held to answer in the district of arrest.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). Although the matter of bail is dealt with in rule 46 and 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3146 and 3148, new subdivision (f) has been added to clarify the situation in which a defendant makes his initial appearance before the United States magistrate and there is a warrant issued by a judge of a different district who has endorsed the amount of bail on the warrant. The present ambiguity of the rule is creating practical administrative problems. If the United States magistrate concludes that a lower bail is appropriate, the judge who fixed the original bail on the warrant has, on occasion, expressed the view that this is inappropriate conduct by the magistrate. If the magistrate, in such circumstances, does not reduce the bail to the amount supported by all of the facts, there may be caused unnecessary inconvenience to the defendant, and there would arguably be a violation of at least the spirit of the Bail Reform Act and the Eighth Amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Procedures Manual for United States Magistrates, issued under the authority of the Judicial Conference of the United States, provides in ch. 6, pp. 8&ndash;9:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Where the arrest occurs in a &ldquo;distant&rdquo; district, the rules do not expressly limit the discretion of the magistrate in the setting of conditions of release. However, whether or not the magistrate in the district of arrest has authority to set his own bail under Rule 40, considerations of propriety and comity would dictate that the magistrate should not attempt to set bail in a lower amount than that fixed by a judge in another district. If an unusual situation should arise where it appears from all the information available to the magistrate that the amount of bail endorsed on the warrant is excessive, he should consult with a judge of his own district or with the judge in the other district who fixed the bail in order to resolve any difficulties. (Where an amount of bail is merely recommended on the indictment by the United States attorney, the magistrate has complete discretion in setting conditions of release.)</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Rule 40 as amended would encourage the above practice and hopefully would eliminate the present confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (f) requires that the magistrate set forth the reasons for his action in writing whenever he fixes bail in an amount different from that previously fixed. Setting forth the reasons for the amount of bail fixed, certainly a sound practice in all circumstances, is particularly appropriate when the bail differs from that previously fixed in another district. The requirement that reasons be set out will ensure that the &ldquo;considerations of propriety and comity&rdquo; referred to above will be specifically taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Modification of Proposed 1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1(2) of Pub. L. 96&ndash;42 [set out as a note under section 2074 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure] provided in part that the amendment proposed by the Supreme Court [in its order of Apr. 30, 1979] affecting rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [this rule] would take effect on Aug. 1, 1979, as amended by that section. See 1979 Amendment note below.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:124 --><h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to 40(d) is intended to make it clear that the transfer provisions therein apply whenever the arrest occurs other than in the district of probation jurisdiction, and that if probable cause is found at a preliminary hearing held pursuant to Rule 40(d)(2) the probationer should be held to answer in the district having probation jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body">On occasion, the district of probation supervision and the district of probation jurisdiction will not be the same. See, e.g., <em>Cupp v. Byington</em>, 179 F.Supp. 669 (S.D.Ind. 1960) (supervision in Southern District of Indiana, but jurisdiction never transferred from District of Nevada). In such circumstances, it is the district having <em>jurisdiction</em> which may revoke the defendant's probation. <em>Cupp v. Byington</em>, supra; 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653 (&ldquo;the court for the district having jurisdiction over him *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may revoke the probation&rdquo;; if probationer goes to another district, &ldquo;jurisdiction over him may be transferred,&rdquo; and only then does &ldquo;the court for the district to which jurisdiction is transferred *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* have all the power with respect to the probationer that was previously possessed by the court for the district from which the transfer was made&rdquo;). That being the case, that is the jurisdiction to which the probationer should be transferred as provided in Rule 40(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because Rule 32.1 has now taken effect, a cross-reference to those provisions has been made in subdivision (d)(1) so as to clarify how the magistrate is to proceed if jurisdiction is transferred.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments recognize that convicted defendants may be on supervised release as well as on probation. See 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3583, and 3624(e).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (a) is intended to expedite determining where a defendant will be held to answer by permitting facsimile transmission of a warrant or a certified copy of the warrant. The amendment recognizes an increased reliance by the public in general, and the legal profession in particular, on accurate and efficient transmission of important legal documents by facsimile machines.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is also amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (d) is intended to clarify the authority of a magistrate judge to set conditions of release in those cases where a probationer or supervised releasee is arrested in a district other than the district having jurisdiction. As written, there appeared to be a gap in Rule 40, especially under (d)(1) where the alleged violation occurs in a jurisdiction other than the district having jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body">A number of rules contain references to pretrial, trial, and post-trial release or detention of defendants, probationers and supervised releasees. Rule 46, for example, addresses the topic of release from custody. Although Rule 46(c) addresses custody pending sentencing and notice of appeal, the rule makes no explicit provision for detaining or releasing probationers or supervised releasees who are later arrested for violating terms of their probation or release. Rule 32.1 provides guidance on proceedings involving revocation of probation or supervised release. In particular, Rule 32.1(a)(1) recognizes that when a person is held in custody on the ground that the person violated a condition of probation or supervised release, the judge or United States magistrate judge may release the person under Rule 46(c), pending the revocation proceeding. But no other explicit reference is made in Rule 32.1 to the authority of a judge or magistrate judge to determine conditions of release for a probationer or supervised releasee who is arrested in a district other than the district having jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment recognizes that a judge or magistrate judge considering the case of a probationer or supervised releasee under Rule 40(d) has the same authority vis a vis decisions regarding custody as a judge or magistrate judge proceeding under Rule 32.1(a)(1). Thus, regardless of the ultimate disposition of an arrested probationer or supervised releasee under Rule 40(d), a judge or magistrate judge acting under that rule may rely upon Rule 46(c) in determining whether custody should be continued and if not, what conditions, if any, should be placed upon the person.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 40(a) is a technical, conforming change to reflect an amendment to Rule 5, which recognizes a limited exception to the general rule that all arrestees must be taken before a federal magistrate judge.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Issue Warrant</cap-smallcap>. Upon the request of a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government, a search warrant authorized by this rule may be issued (1) by a federal magistrate judge, or a state court of record within the federal district, for a search of property or for a person within the district and (2) by a federal magistrate judge for a search of property or for a person either within or outside the district if the property or person is within the district when the warrant is sought but might move outside the district before the warrant is executed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Property or Persons Which May Be Seized With a Warrant</cap-smallcap>. A warrant may be is<!-- PDFPage:125 -->sued under this rule to search for and seize any (1) property that constitutes evidence of the commission of a criminal offense; or (2) contraband, the fruits of crime, or things otherwise criminally possessed; or (3) property designed or intended for use or which is or has been used as the means of committing a criminal offense; or (4) person for whose arrest there is probable cause, or who is unlawfully restrained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and Contents.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Warrant Upon Affidavit</em>. A warrant other than a warrant upon oral testimony under paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall issue only on an affidavit or affidavits sworn to before the federal magistrate judge or state judge and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. If the federal magistrate judge or state judge is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, that magistrate judge or state judge shall issue a warrant identifying the property or person to be seized and naming or describing the person or place to be searched. The finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part. Before ruling on a request for a warrant the federal magistrate judge or state judge may require the affiant to appear personally and may examine under oath the affiant and any witnesses the affiant may produce, provided that such proceeding shall be taken down by a court reporter or recording equipment and made part of the affidavit. The warrant shall be directed to a civil officer of the United States authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law thereof or to a person so authorized by the President of the United States. It shall command the officer to search, within a specified period of time not to exceed 10 days, the person or place named for the property or person specified. The warrant shall be served in the daytime, unless the issuing authority, by appropriate provision in the warrant, and for reasonable cause shown, authorizes its execution at times other than daytime. It shall designate a federal magistrate judge to whom it shall be returned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Warrant Upon Oral Testimony.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>General Rule</cap-smallcap>. If the circumstances make it reasonable to dispense, in whole or in part, with a written affidavit, a Federal magistrate judge may issue a warrant based upon sworn testimony communicated by telephone or other appropriate means, including facsimile transmission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>. The person who is requesting the warrant shall prepare a document to be known as a duplicate original warrant and shall read such duplicate original warrant, verbatim, to the Federal magistrate judge. The Federal magistrate judge shall enter, verbatim, what is so read to such magistrate judge on a document to be known as the original warrant. The Federal magistrate judge may direct that the warrant be modified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>. If the Federal magistrate judge is satisfied that the circumstances are such as to make it reasonable to dispense with a written affidavit and that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, the Federal magistrate judge shall order the issuance of a warrant by directing the person requesting the warrant to sign the Federal magistrate judge's name on the duplicate original warrant. The Federal magistrate judge shall immediately sign the original warrant and enter on the face of the original warrant the exact time when the warrant was ordered to be issued. The finding of probable cause for a warrant upon oral testimony may be based on the same kind of evidence as is sufficient for a warrant upon affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Recording and Certification of Testimony</cap-smallcap>. When a caller informs the Federal magistrate judge that the purpose of the call is to request a warrant, the Federal magistrate judge shall immediately place under oath each person whose testimony forms a basis of the application and each person applying for that warrant. If a voice recording device is available, the Federal magistrate judge shall record by means of such device all of the call after the caller informs the Federal magistrate judge that the purpose of the call is to request a warrant. Otherwise a stenographic or longhand verbatim record shall be made. If a voice recording device is used or a stenographic record made, the Federal magistrate judge shall have the record transcribed, shall certify the accuracy of the transcription, and shall file a copy of the original record and the transcription with the court. If a longhand verbatim record is made, the Federal magistrate judge shall file a signed copy with the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>. The contents of a warrant upon oral testimony shall be the same as the contents of a warrant upon affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Additional Rule for Execution</cap-smallcap>. The person who executes the warrant shall enter the exact time of execution on the face of the duplicate original warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Motion To Suppress Precluded</cap-smallcap>. Absent a finding of bad faith, evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant issued under this paragraph is not subject to a motion to suppress on the ground that the circumstances were not such as to make it reasonable to dispense with a written affidavit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Execution and Return With Inventory</cap-smallcap>. The officer taking property under the warrant shall give to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was taken. The return shall be made promptly and shall be accompanied by a written inventory of any property taken. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the applicant for the warrant and the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, if they are present, or in the presence of at least one credible person other than the applicant for the warrant or the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, and shall be verified by the officer. The federal magistrate judge shall upon request deliver a copy of the inventory to the person from whom or from whose premises the <!-- PDFPage:126 -->property was taken and to the applicant for the warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Motion for Return of Property</cap-smallcap>. A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure or by the deprivation of property may move the district court for the district in which the property was seized for the return of the property on the ground that such person is entitled to lawful possession of the property. The court shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision of the motion. If the motion is granted, the property shall be returned to the movant, although reasonable conditions may be imposed to protect access and use of the property in subsequent proceedings. If a motion for return of property is made or comes on for hearing in the district of trial after an indictment or information is filed, it shall be treated also as a motion to suppress under Rule 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Motion To Suppress</cap-smallcap>. A motion to suppress evidence may be made in the court of the district of trial as provided in Rule 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Return of Papers to Clerk</cap-smallcap>. The federal magistrate judge before whom the warrant is returned shall attach to the warrant a copy of the return, inventory and all other papers in connection therewith and shall file them with the clerk of the district court for the district in which the property was seized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Scope and Definition</cap-smallcap>. This rule does not modify any act, inconsistent with it, regulating search, seizure and the issuance and execution of search warrants in circumstances for which special provision is made. The term &ldquo;property&rdquo; is used in this rule to include documents, books, papers and any other tangible objects. The term &ldquo;daytime&rdquo; is used in this rule to mean the hours from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. according to local time. The phrase &ldquo;federal law enforcement officer&rdquo; is used in this rule to mean any government agent, other than an attorney for the government as defined in Rule 54(c), who is engaged in the enforcement of the criminal laws and is within any category of officers authorized by the Attorney General to request the issuance of a search warrant.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is a codification of existing law and practice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 611.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 612; <em>Conyer v. United States</em>, 80 F.2d 292 (C.C.A. 6th). This provision does not supersede or repeal special statutory provisions permitting the issuance of search warrants in specific circumstances. See Subdivision (g) and Note thereto, <em>infra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). This rule is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 613&ndash;616, 620; <em>Dumbra v. United States</em>, 268 U.S. 435.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This rule is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 621&ndash;624.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). This rule is a restatement of existing law and practice, with the exception hereafter noted, 18 U.S.C. [former] 625, 626; <em>Weeks v. United States</em>, 232 U.S. 383; <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States</em>, 251 U.S. 385; <em>Agello v. United States</em>, 269 U.S. 20; <em>Gouled v. United States</em>, 255 U.S. 298. While under existing law a motion to suppress evidence or to compel return of property obtained by an illegal search and seizure may be made either before a commissioner subject to review by the court on motion, or before the court, the rule provides that such motion may be made only before the court. The purpose is to prevent multiplication of proceedings and to bring the matter before the court in the first instance. While during the life of the Eighteenth Amendment when such motions were numerous it was a common practice in some districts for commissioners to hear such motions, the prevailing practice at the present time is to make such motions before the district court. This practice, which is deemed to be preferable, is embodied in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). This rule is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 627; Cf. Rule 5(c) (last sentence).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (g). While Rule 41 supersedes the general provisions of 18 U.S.C. 611&ndash;626 [now 18 U.S.C. 3105, 3109], relating to search warrants, it does not supersede, but preserves, all other statutory provisions permitting searches and seizures in specific situations.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3).&mdash;The amendment is to substitute proper reference to Title 18 in place of the repealed acts.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:127 --><p class="note-body">Subdivision (g).&mdash;To eliminate reference to sections of the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, which have been repealed by the Act of June 25, 1948, c. 645, which enacted Title 18.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to provide that a search warrant may be issued only upon the request of a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government. The phrase &ldquo;federal law enforcement officer&rdquo; is defined in subdivision (h) in a way which will allow the Attorney General to designate the category of officers who are authorized to make application for a search warrant. The phrase &ldquo;attorney for the government&rdquo; is defined in rule 54.</p>
<p class="note-body">The title to subdivision (b) is changed to make it conform more accurately to the content of the subdivision. Subdivision (b) is also changed to modernize the language used to describe the property which may be seized with a lawfully issued search warrant and to take account of a recent Supreme Court decision (<em>Warden v. Haden</em>, 387 U.S. 294 (1967)) and recent congressional action (18 U.S.C. &sect;3103a) which authorize the issuance of a search warrant to search for items of solely evidential value. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3103a provides that &ldquo;a warrant may be issued to search for and seize any property that constitutes evidence of a criminal offense.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent state legislation authorizes the issuance of a search warrant for evidence of crime. See, <em>e.g</em>., Cal. Penal Code &sect;1524(4) (West Supp. 1968); Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, &sect;108&ndash;3 (1965); LSA C.Cr.P. art. 161 (1967); N.Y. CPL &sect;690.10(4) (McKinney, 1971); Ore.Rev.Stat. &sect;141.010 (1969); Wis.Stat. &sect;968.13(2) (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">The general weight of recent text and law review comment has been in favor of allowing a search for evidence. 8 Wigmore, Evidence &sect;2184a. (McNaughton rev. 1961); Kamisar. The Wiretapping-Eavesdropping Problem: A professor's View, 44 Minn.L.Rev. 891 (1960); Kaplan, Search and Seizure: A No-Man's Land in the Criminal Law, 49 Calif.L.Rev. 474 (1961); Comments: 66 Colum.L.Rev. 355 (1966), 45 N.C.L.Rev. 512 (1967), 20 U.Chi.L.Rev. 319 (1953).</p>
<p class="note-body">There is no intention to limit the protection of the fifth amendment against compulsory self-incrimination, so items which are solely &ldquo;testimonial&rdquo; or &ldquo;communicative&rdquo; in nature might well be inadmissible on those grounds. <em>Schmerber v. California</em>, 384 U.S. 757 (1966). The court referred to the possible fifth amendment limitation in <em>Warden v. Hayden, supra:</em></p>
<p class="note-body">This case thus does not require that we consider whether there are items of evidential value whose very nature precludes them from being the object of a reasonable search and seizure. [387 U.S. at 303].</p>
<p class="note-body">See ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure &sect;551.03(2) and commentary at pp. 3&ndash;5 (April 30, 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">It seems preferable to allow the fifth amendment limitation to develop as cases arise rather than attempt to articulate the constitutional doctrine as part of the rule itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (c) is intended to make clear that a search warrant may properly be based upon a finding of probable cause based upon hearsay. That a search warrant may properly be issued on the basis of hearsay is current law. See, <em>e.g., Jones v. United States</em>, 362 U.S. 257 (1960); <em>Spinelli v. United States</em>, 393 U.S. 410 (1969). See also <em>State v. Beal</em>, 40 Wis.2d 607, 162 N.W.2d 640 (1968), reversing prior Wisconsin cases which held that a search warrant could not properly issue on the basis of hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision in subdivision (c) that the magistrate may examine the affiant or witnesses under oath is intended to assure him an opportunity to make a careful decision as to whether there is probable cause. It seems desirable to do this as an incident to the issuance of the warrant rather than having the issue raised only later on a motion to suppress the evidence. See L. Tiffany, D. McIntyre, and D. Rotenberg, Detection of Crime 118 (1967). If testimony is taken it must be recorded, transcribed, and made part of the affidavit or affidavits. This is to insure an adequate basis for determining the sufficiency of the evidentiary grounds for the issuance of the search warrant if that question should later arise.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the warrant itself state the grounds for its issuance and the names of any affiants, is eliminated as unnecessary paper work. There is no comparable requirement for an arrest warrant in rule 4. A person who wishes to challenge the validity of a search warrant has access to the affidavits upon which the warrant was issued.</p>
<p class="note-body">The former requirement that the warrant require that the search be conducted &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is changed to read &ldquo;within a specified period of time not to exceed 10 days.&rdquo; The former rule contained an inconsistency between subdivision (c) requiring that the search be conducted &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; and subdivision (d) requiring execution &ldquo;within 10 days after its date.&rdquo; The amendment resolves this ambiguity and confers discretion upon the issuing magistrate to specify the time within which the search may be conducted to meet the needs of the particular case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is also changed to allow the magistrate to authorize a search at a time other than &ldquo;daytime,&rdquo; where there is &ldquo;reasonable cause shown&rdquo; for doing so. To make clear what &ldquo;daytime&rdquo; means, the term is defined in subdivision (h).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) is amended to conform its language to the Federal Magistrates Act. The language &ldquo;The warrant may be executed and returned only within 10 days after its date&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The matter is now covered adequately in proposed subdivision (c) which gives the issuing officer authority to fix the time within which the warrant is to be executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (e) and the addition of subdivision (f) are intended to require the motion to suppress evidence to be made in the trial court rather than in the district in which the evidence was seized as now allowed by the rule. In <em>DiBella v. United States</em>, 369 U.S. 121 (1962), the court, in effect, discouraged motions to suppress in the district in which the property was seized:</p>
<p class="note-body">There is a decision in the Second Circuit, <em>United States v. Klapholz</em>, 230 F.2d 494 (1956), allowing the Government an appeal from an order granting a post-indictment motion to suppress, apparently for the single reason that the motion was filed in the district of seizure rather than of trial; but the case was soon thereafter taken by a District Court to have counseled declining jurisdiction of such motions for reasons persuasive against allowing the appeal: &ldquo;This course will avoid a needless duplication of effort by two courts and provide a more expeditious resolution of the controversy besides avoiding the risk of determining prematurely and inadequately the admissibility of evidence at the trial.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A piecemeal adjudication such as that which would necessarily follow from a disposition of the motion here might conceivably result in prejudice either to the Government or the defendants, or both.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Lester</em>, 21 F.R.D. 30, 31 (D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1957). Rule 41(e), of course, specifically provides for making of the motion in the district of seizure On a summary hearing, however, the ruling there is likely always to be tentative. We think it accords most satisfactorily with sound administration of the Rules to treat such rulings as interlocutory. [369 U.S. at 132&ndash;133.]</p>
<p class="note-body">As amended, subdivision (e) provides for a return of the property if (1) the person is entitled to lawful possession <em>and</em> (2) the seizure was illegal. This means that the judge in the district of seizure does not have to decide the legality of the seizure in cases involving contraband which, even if seized illegally, is not to be returned.</p>
<p class="note-body">The five grounds for returning the property, presently listed in the rule, are dropped for two reasons&mdash;(1) substantive grounds for objecting to illegally obtained evidence (<em>e.g., Miranda</em>) are not ordinarily codified in the rules and (2) the categories are not entirely accurate. See <em>United States v. Howard</em>, 138 F.Supp. 376, 380 (D.Md. 1956).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:128 --><p class="note-body">A sentence is added to subdivision (e) to provide that a motion for return of property, made in the district of trial, shall be treated also as a motion to suppress under rule 12. This change is intended to further the objective of rule 12 which is to have all pretrial motions disposed of in a single court appearance rather than to have a series of pretrial motions made on different dates, causing undue delay in administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f) is new and reflects the position that it is best to have the motion to suppress made in the court of the district of trial rather than in the court of the district in which the seizure occurred. The motion to suppress in the district of trial should be made in accordance with the provisions of rule 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g) is changed to conform to subdivision (c) which requires the return to be made before a federal judicial officer even though the search warrant may have been issued by a nonfederal magistrate.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (h) is former rule 41(g) with the addition of a definition of the term &ldquo;daytime&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;federal law enforcement officer.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment restores the words &ldquo;court of record&rdquo; which were inadvertently omitted from the amended text of the subdivision which was transmitted by the Judicial Conference to the Supreme Court and prescribed by the Court on April 24, 1972.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1977 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 41(c)(2) is added to establish a procedure for the issuance of a search warrant when it is not reasonably practicable for the person obtaining the warrant to present a written affidavit to a magistrate or a state judge as required by subdivision (c)(1). At least two states have adopted a similar procedure, Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;13&ndash;1444(c)&ndash;1445(c) (Supp. 1973); Cal.Pen. Code &sect;&sect;1526(b), 1528(b) (West Supp. 1974), and comparable amendments are under consideration in other jurisdictions. See Israel, Legislative Regulation of Searches and Seizures: The Michigan Proposals, 73 Mich.L.Rev. 221, 258&ndash;63 (1975); Nakell, Proposed Revisions of North Carolina's Search and Seizure Law, 52 N.Car.L.Rev. 277, 306&ndash;11 (1973). It has been strongly recommended that &ldquo;every State enact legislation that provides for the issuance of search warrants pursuant to telephoned petitions and affidavits from police officers.&rdquo; National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Report on Police 95 (1973). Experience with the procedure has been most favorable. Miller, Telephonic Search Warrants: The San Diego Experience, 9 The Prosecutor 385 (1974).</p>
<p class="note-body">The trend of recent Supreme Court decisions has been to give greater priority to the use of a search warrant as the proper way of making a lawful search:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">It is a cardinal rule that, in seizing goods and articles, law enforcement agents must secure and use search warrants whenever reasonably practicable. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This rule rests upon the desirability of having magistrates rather than police officers determine when searches and seizures are permissible and what limitations should be placed upon such activities. <em>Trupiano v. United States</em>, 334 U.S. 699, 705 (1948), quoted with approval in <em>Chimel v. California</em>, 395 U.S. 752, 758 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire</em>, 403 U.S. 443 (1971); Note, Chambers v. Maroney: New Dimensions in the Law of Search and Seizure, 46 Indiana L.J. 257, 262 (1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Use of search warrants can best be encouraged by making it administratively feasible to obtain a warrant when one is needed. One reason for the nonuse of the warrant has been the administrative difficulties involved in getting a warrant, particularly at times of the day when a judicial officer is ordinarily unavailable. See L. Tiffany, D. McIntyre, and D. Rotenberg, Detection of Crime 105&ndash;116 (1967); LaFave, Improving Police Performance Through the Exclusionary Rule, 30 Mo.L.Rev. 391, 411 (1965). Federal law enforcement officers are not infrequently confronted with situations in which the circumstances are not sufficiently &ldquo;exigent&rdquo; to justify the serious step of conducting a warrantless search of private premises, but yet there exists a significant possibility that critical evidence would be lost in the time it would take to obtain a search warrant by traditional means. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Johnson</em>,&mdash;F.2d&mdash;(D.C. Cir. June 16, 1975).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(2) provides that a warrant may be issued on the basis of an oral statement of a person not in the physical presence of the federal magistrate. Telephone, radio, or other electronic methods of communication are contemplated. For the warrant to properly issue, four requirements must be met:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The applicant&mdash;a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government, as required by subdivision (a)&mdash;must persuade the magistrate that the circumstances of time and place make it reasonable to request the magistrate to issue a warrant on the basis of oral testimony. This restriction on the issuance of a warrant recognizes the inherent limitations of an oral warrant procedure, the lack of demeanor evidence, and the lack of a written record for the reviewing magistrate to consider before issuing the warrant. See Comment, Oral Search Warrants: A New Standard of Warrant Availability, 21 U.C.L.A. Law Review 691, 701 (1974). Circumstances making it reasonable to obtain a warrant on oral testimony exist if delay in obtaining the warrant might result in the destruction or disappearance of the property [see <em>Chimel v. California</em>, 395 U.S. 752, 773&ndash;774 (1969) (White, dissenting); Landynski, The Supreme Court's Search for Fourth Amendment Standards: The Warrantless Search, 45 Conn.B.J. 2, 25 (1971)]; or because of the time when the warrant is sought, the distance from the magistrate of the person seeking the warrant, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The applicant must orally state facts sufficient to satisfy the probable cause requirement for the issuance of the search warrant. (See subdivision (c)(1).) This information may come from either the applicant federal law enforcement officer or the attorney for the government or a witness willing to make an oral statement. The oral testimony must be recorded at this time so that the transcribed affidavit will provide an adequate basis for determining the sufficiency of the evidence if that issue should later arise. See Kipperman. Inaccurate Search Warrant Affidavits as a Ground for Suppressing Evidence, 84 Harv.L.Rev. 825 (1971). It is contemplated that the recording of the oral testimony will be made by a court reporter, by a mechanical recording device, or by a verbatim contemporaneous writing by the magistrate. Recording a telephone conversation is no longer difficult with many easily operated recorders available. See 86:2 L.A. Daily Journal 1 (1973); Miller, Telephonic Search Warrants: The San Diego Experience, 9 The Prosecutor 385, 386 (1974).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The applicant must read the contents of the warrant to the federal magistrate in order to enable the magistrate to know whether the requirements of certainty in the warrant are satisfied. The magistrate may direct that changes be made in the warrant. If the magistrate approves the warrant as requested or as modified by the magistrate, he then issues the warrant by directing the applicant to sign the magistrate's name to the duplicate original warrant. The magistrate then causes to be made a written copy of the approved warrant. This constitutes the original warrant. The magistrate enters the time of issuance of the duplicate original warrant on the face of the original warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Return of the duplicate original warrant and the original warrant must conform to subdivision (d). The transcript of the sworn oral testimony setting forth the grounds for issuance of the warrant must be signed by affiant in the presence of the magistrate and filed with the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because federal magistrates are likely to be accessible through the use of the telephone or other electronic devices, it is unnecessary to authorize state judges to issue warrants under subdivision (c)(2).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:129 --><p class="note-body">Although the procedure set out in subdivision (c)(2) contemplates resort to technology which did not exist when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, the Advisory Committee is of the view that the procedure complies with all of the requirements of the Amendment. The telephonic search warrant process has been upheld as constitutional by the courts, e.g., <em>People v. Peck</em>, 38 Cal.App.3d 993, 113 Cal.Rptr. 806 (1974), and has consistently been so viewed by commentators. See Israel, Legislative Regulation of Searches and Seizures: The Michigan Proposals, 73 Mich.L.Rev. 221, 260 (1975); Nakell, Proposed Revisions of North Carolina's Search and Seizure Law, 52 N.Car.L.Rev. 277, 310 (1973); Comment, Oral Search Warrants: A New Standard of Warrant Availability, 21 U.C.L.A.Rev. 691, 697 (1973).</p>
<p class="note-body">Reliance upon oral testimony as a basis for issuing a search warrant is permissible under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Campbell v. Minnesota</em>, 487 F.2d 1 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>United States ex rel. Gaugler v. Brierley</em>, 477 F.2d 516 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>Tabasko v. Barton</em>, 472 F.2d 871 (6th Cir. 1972); <em>Frazier v. Roberts</em>, 441 F.2d 1224 (8th Cir. 1971). Thus, the procedure authorized under subdivision (c)(2) is not objectionable on the ground that the oral statement is not transcribed in advance of the issuance of the warrant. <em>People v. Peck</em>, 38 Cal.App.3d 993, 113 Cal.Rptr. 806 (1974). Although it has been questioned whether oral testimony will suffice under the Fourth Amendment if some kind of contemporaneous record is not made of that testimony, see dissent from denial of certiorari in <em>Christofferson v. Washington</em>, 393 U.S. 1090 (1969), this problem is not present under the procedure set out in subdivision (c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Fourth Amendment requires that warrants issue &ldquo;upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation.&rdquo; The significance of the oath requirement is &ldquo;that someone must take the responsibility for the facts alleged, giving rise to the probable cause for the issuance of a warrant.&rdquo; <em>United States ex rel. Pugh v. Pate</em>, 401 F.2d 6 (7th Cir. 1968); See also <em>Frazier v. Roberts</em>, 441 F.2d 1224 (8th Cir. 1971). This is accomplished under the procedure required by subdivision (c)(2); the need for an oath under the Fourth Amendment does not &ldquo;require a face to face confrontation between the magistrate and the affiant.&rdquo; <em>People v. Chavaz</em>, 27 Cal.App.3d 883, 104 Cal.Rptr. 247 (1972). See also <em>People v. Aguirre</em>, 26 Cal.App.3d 7, 103 Cal.Rptr. 153 (1972), noting it is unnecessary that &ldquo;oral statements [be] taken in the physical presence of the magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The availability of the procedure authorized by subdivision (c)(2) will minimize the necessity of federal law enforcement officers engaging in other practices which, at least on occasion, might threaten to a greater extent those values protected by the Fourth Amendment. Although it is permissible for an officer in the field to relay his information by radio or telephone to another officer who has more ready access to a magistrate and who will thus act as the affiant, <em>Lopez v. United States</em>, 370 F.2d 8 (5th Cir. 1966); <em>State v. Banks</em>, 250 N.C. 728, 110 S.E.2d 322 (1959), that procedure is less desirable than that permitted under subdivision (c)(2), for it deprives &ldquo;the magistrate of the opportunity to examine the officer at the scene, who is in a much better position to answer questions relating to probable cause and the requisite scope of the search.&rdquo; Israel, Legislative Regulation of Searches and Seizures: The Michigan Proposals, 73 Mich.L.Rev. 221, 260 (1975). Or, in the absence of the subdivision (c)(2) procedure, officers might take &ldquo;protective custody&rdquo; of the premises and occupants for a significant period of time while a search warrant was sought by traditional means. The extent to which the &ldquo;protective custody&rdquo; procedure may be employed consistent with the Fourth Amendment is uncertain at best; see Griswold, Criminal Procedure, 1969&mdash;Is It a Means or an End?, 29 Md.L.Rev. 307, 317 (1969). The unavailability of the subdivision (c)(2) procedure also makes more tempting an immediate resort to a warrantless search in the hope that the circumstances will later be found to have been sufficiently &ldquo;exigent&rdquo; to justify such a step. See Miller, Telephonic Search Warrants: The San Diego Experience, 9 The Prosecutor 385, 386 (1974), noting a dramatic increase in police utilization of the warrant process following enactment of a telephonic warrant statute.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 95&ndash;354; 1977 Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="note-body">The committee agrees with the Supreme Court that it is desirable to encourage Federal law enforcement officers to seek search warrants in situations where they might otherwise conduct warrantless searches by providing for a telephone search warrant procedure with the basic characteristics suggested in the proposed Rule 41(c)(2). As the Supreme Court has observed, &ldquo;It is a cardinal rule that, in seizing goods and articles, law enforcement agents must secure and use search warrants whenever reasonably practicable.&rdquo; After consideration of the Supreme Court version and a proposal set forth in H.R. 7888, the committee decided to use the language of the House bill as the vehicle, with certain modifications.</p>
<p class="note-body">A new provision, as indicated in subparagraph (c)(2)(A), is added to establish a procedure for the issuance of a search warrant where the circumstances make it reasonable to dispense with a written affidavit to be presented in person to a magistrate. At least two States have adopted a similar procedure&mdash;Arizona and California&mdash;and comparable amendments are under consideration in other jurisdictions. Such a procedure has been strongly recommended by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals and State experience with the procedure has been favorable. The telephone search warrant process has been upheld as constitutional by the courts and has consistently been so viewed by commentators.</p>
<p class="note-body">In recommending a telephone search warrant procedure, the Advisory Committee note on the Supreme Court proposal points out that the preferred method of conducting a search is with a search warrant. The note indicates that the rationale for the proposed change is to encourage Federal law enforcement officers to seek search warrants in situations when they might otherwise conduct warrantless searches. &ldquo;Federal law enforcement officers are not infrequently confronted with situations in which the circumstances are not sufficiently &lsquo;exigent&rsquo; to justify the serious step of conducting a warrantless search of private premises, but yet there exists a significant possibility that critical evidence would be lost in the time it would take to obtain a search warrant by traditional means.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(2)(B) provides that the person requesting the warrant shall prepare a &ldquo;duplicate original warrant&rdquo; which will be read and recorded verbatim by the magistrate on an &ldquo;original warrant.&rdquo; The magistrate may direct that the warrant be modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(2)(C) provides that, if the magistrate is satisfied that the circumstances are such as to make it reasonable to dispense with a written affidavit and that grounds for the application exist or there is probable cause to believe that they exist, he shall order the issuance of the warrant by directing the requestor to sign the magistrate's name on the duplicate original warrant. The magistrate is required to sign the original warrant and enter the time of issuance thereon. The finding of probable cause may be based on the same type of evidence appropriate for a warrant upon affidavit.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(2)(D) requires the magistrate to place the requestor and any witness under oath and, if a voice recording device is available, to record the proceeding. If a voice recording is not available, the proceeding must be recorded verbatim stenographically or in longhand. Verified copies must be filed with the court as specified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(2)(E) provides that the contents of the warrant upon oral testimony shall be the same as the contents of a warrant upon affidavit.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (c)(2)(F) provides that the person who executes the warrant shall enter the exact time of execution on the face of the duplicate original warrant. <!-- PDFPage:130 -->Unlike H.R. 7888, this subparagraph does not require the person who executes the warrant to have physical possession of the duplicate original warrant at the time of the execution of the warrant. The committee believes this would make an unwise and unnecessary distinction between execution of regular warrants issued on written affidavits and warrants issued by telephone that would limit the flexibility and utility of this procedure for no useful purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, subparagraph (c)(2)(G) makes it clear that, absent a finding of bad faith by the government, the magistrate's judgment that the circumstances made it reasonable to dispense with a written affidavit&mdash;a decision that does not go to the core question of whether there was probable cause to issue a warrant&mdash;is not a ground for granting a motion to suppress evidence.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Modification of Proposed 1977 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2(e) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;78 provided in part that the amendment by the Supreme Court [in its order of Apr. 26, 1976] to subdivision (c) of rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [subd. (c) of this rule] is approved in a modified form.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment to Rule 41 is intended to make it possible for a search warrant to issue to search <em>for</em> a person under two circumstances: (i) when there is probable cause to arrest that person; or (ii) when that person is being unlawfully restrained. There may be instances in which a search warrant would be required to conduct a search in either of these circumstances. Even when a search warrant would not be required to enter a place to search for a person, a procedure for obtaining a warrant should be available so that law enforcement officers will be encouraged to resort to the preferred alternative of acquiring &ldquo;an objective predetermination of probable cause&rdquo; <em>Katz v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), in this instance, that the person sought is at the place to be searched.</p>
<p class="note-body">That part of the amendment which authorizes issuance of a search warrant to search for a person unlawfully restrained is consistent with ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure &sect;SS 210.3(1)(d) (Proposed Official Draft, 1975), which specifies that a search warrant may issue to search for &ldquo;an individual *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* who is unlawfully held in confinement or other restraint.&rdquo; As noted in the Commentary thereto, id. at p. 507:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Ordinarily such persons will be held against their will and in that case the persons are, of course, not subject to &ldquo;seizure.&rdquo; But they are, in a sense, &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of crime, and the use of search warrants for these purposes presents no conceptual difficulties.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some state search warrant provisions also provide for issuance of a warrant in these circumstances. See, e. g., Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, &sect;108&ndash;3 (&ldquo;Any person who has been kidnapped in violation of the laws of this State, or who has been kidnapped in another jurisdiction and is now concealed within this State&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">It may be that very often exigent circumstances, especially the need to act very promptly to protect the life or well-being of the kidnap victim, would justify an immediate warrantless search for the person restrained. But this is not inevitably the case. Moreover, as noted above there should be available a process whereby law enforcement agents may acquire in advance a judicial determination that they have cause to intrude upon the privacy of those at the place where the victim is thought to be located.</p>
<p class="note-body">That part of the amendment which authorizes issuance of a search warrant to search for a person to be arrested is also consistent with ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure &sect;SS 210.3(1)(d) (Proposed Official Draft, 1975), which states that a search warrant may issue to search for &ldquo;an individual for whose arrest there is reasonable cause.&rdquo; As noted in the Commentary thereto, id. at p. 507, it is desirable that there be &ldquo;explicit statutory authority for such searches.&rdquo; Some state search warrant provisions also expressly provide for the issuance of a search warrant to search for a person to be arrested. See, e. g., Del.Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;2305 (&ldquo;Persons for whom a warrant of arrest has been issued&rdquo;). This part of the amendment to Rule 41 covers a defendant or witness for whom an arrest warrant has theretofore issued, or a defendant for whom grounds to arrest exist even though no arrest warrant has theretofore issued. It also covers the arrest of a deportable alien under 8 U.S.C. &sect;1252, whose presence at a certain place might be important evidence of criminal conduct by another person, such as the harboring of undocumented aliens under 8 U.S.C. &sect;1324(a)(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>United States v. Watson</em>, 423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976), the Court once again alluded to &ldquo;the still unsettled question&rdquo; of whether, absent exigent circumstances, officers acting without a warrant may enter private premises to make an arrest. Some courts have indicated that probable cause alone ordinarily is sufficient to support an arrest entry. <em>United States v. Fernandez</em>, 480 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States ex rel. Wright v. Woods</em>, 432 F.2d 1143 (7th Cir. 1970). There exists some authority, however, that except under exigent circumstances a warrant is required to enter the defendant's own premises, <em>United States v. Calhoun</em>, 542 F.2d 1094 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Lindsay</em>, 506 F.2d 166 (D.C.Cir. 1974); <em>Dorman v. United States</em>, 435 F.2d 385 (D.C.Cir. 1970), or, at least, to enter the premises of a third party, <em>Virgin Islands v. Gereau</em>, 502 F.2d 914 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>Fisher v. Volz</em>, 496 F.2d 333 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>Huotari v. Vanderport</em>, 380 F.Supp. 645 (D.Minn. 1974).</p>
<p class="note-body">It is also unclear, assuming a need for a warrant, what kind of warrant is required, although it is sometimes assumed that an arrest warrant will suffice, e. g., <em>United States v. Calhoun</em>, supra; <em>United States v. James</em>, 528 F.2d 999 (5th Cir. 1976). There is a growing body of authority, however, that what is needed to justify entry of the premises of a third party to arrest is a search warrant, e. g., <em>Virgin Islands v. Gereau</em>, supra; <em>Fisher v. Volz</em>, supra. The theory is that if the privacy of this third party is to be protected adequately, what is needed is a probable cause determination by a magistrate that the wanted person is presently within that party's premises. &ldquo;A warrant for the arrest of a suspect may indicate that the police officer has probable cause to believe the suspect committed the crime; it affords no basis to believe the suspect is in some stranger's home.&rdquo; <em>Fisher v. Volz</em>, supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">It has sometimes been contended that a search warrant should be required for a nonexigent entry to arrest even when the premises to be entered are those of the person to be arrested. Rotenberg & Tanzer, Searching for the Person to be Seized, 35 Ohio St.L.J. 56, 69 (1974). Case authority in support is lacking, and it may be that the protections of a search warrant are less important in such a situation because ordinarily &ldquo;rudimentary police procedure dictates that a suspect's residence be eliminated as a possible hiding place before a search is conducted elsewhere.&rdquo; <em>People v. Sprovieri</em>, 95 Ill.App.2d 10, 238 N.E.2d 115 (1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">Despite these uncertainties, the fact remains that in some circuits under some circumstances a search warrant is required to enter private premises to arrest. Moreover, the law on this subject is in a sufficient state of uncertainty that this position may be taken by other courts. It is thus important that Rule 41 clearly express that a search warrant for this purpose may issue. And even if future decisions head the other direction, the need for the amendment would still exist. It is clear that law enforcement officers &ldquo;may not constitutionally enter the home of a private individual to search for another person, though he be named in a valid arrest warrant in their possession, absent probable cause to believe that the named suspect is present within at the time.&rdquo; <em>Fisher v. Volz</em>, supra. The cautious officer is entitled to a procedure whereby he may have this probable cause determination made by a neutral and detached magistrate in advance of the entry.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:131 --><h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 41(e) conforms the rule to the practice in most districts and eliminates language that is somewhat confusing. The Supreme Court has upheld warrants for the search and seizure of property in the possession of persons who are not suspected of criminal activity. See, e.g., <em>Zurcher v. Stanford Daily</em>, 436 U.S. 547 (1978). Before the amendment, Rule 41(e) permitted such persons to seek return of their property if they were aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure. But, the rule failed to address the harm that may result from the interference with the lawful use of property by persons who are not suspected of wrongdoing. Courts have recognized that once the government no longer has a need to use evidence, it should be returned. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Wilson</em>, 540 F.2d 1100 (D.C. Cir. 1976). Prior to the amendment, Rule 41(e) did not explicitly recognize a right of a property owner to obtain return of lawfully seized property even though the government might be able to protect its legitimate law enforcement interests in the property despite its return&mdash;e.g., by copying documents or by conditioning the return on government access to the property at a future time. As amended, Rule 41(e) provides that an aggrieved person may seek return of property that has been unlawfully seized, and a person whose property has been lawfully seized may seek return of property when aggrieved by the government's continued possession of it.</p>
<p class="note-body">No standard is set forth in the rule to govern the determination of whether property should be returned to a person aggrieved either by an unlawful seizure or by deprivation of the property. The fourth amendment protects people from unreasonable seizures as well as unreasonable searches, <em>United States v. Place</em>, 462 U.S. 696, 701 (1983), and reasonableness under all of the circumstances must be the test when a person seeks to obtain the return of property. If the United States has a need for the property in an investigation or prosecution, its retention of the property generally is reasonable. But, if the United States&rsquo; legitimate interests can be satisfied even if the property is returned, continued retention of the property would become unreasonable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment deletes language dating from 1944 stating that evidence shall not be admissible at a hearing or at a trial if the court grants the motion to return property under Rule 41(e). This language has not kept pace with the development of exclusionary rule doctrine and is currently only confusing. The Supreme Court has now held that evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment, but in good faith pursuant to a warrant, may be used even against a person aggrieved by the constitutional violation. <em>United States v. Leon</em>, 468 U.S. 897 (1984). The Court has also held that illegally seized evidence may be admissible against persons who are not personally aggrieved by an illegal search or seizure. <em>Rakas v. Illinois</em>, 439 U.S. 128 (1978). Property that is inadmissible for one purpose (e.g., as part of the government's case-in-chief) may be admissible for another purpose (e.g., impeachment, <em>United States v. Havens</em>, 446 U.S. 620 (1980)). Federal courts have relied upon these decisions and permitted the government to retain and to use evidence as permitted by the fourth amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 41(e) is not intended to deny the United States the use of evidence permitted by the fourth amendment and federal statutes, even if the evidence might have been unlawfully seized. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Calandra</em>, 414 U.S. 338, 349 n.6 (1978) (&ldquo;Rule 41(e) does not constitute a statutory expansion of the exclusionary rule.&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Roberts</em>, 852 F.2d 671 (2nd Cir. 1988) (exceptions to exclusionary rule applicable to Rule 41(e)). Thus, the exclusionary provision is deleted, and the scope of the exclusionary rule is reserved for judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">In opting for a reasonableness approach and in deleting the exclusionary language, the Committee rejects the analysis of <em>Sovereign News Co. v. United States</em>, 690 F.2d 569 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 814 (1983), which held that the United States must return photocopies of lawfully seized business records unless it could demonstrate that the records were &ldquo;necessary for a specific investigation.&rdquo; As long as the government has a law enforcement purpose in copying records, there is no reason why it should be saddled with a heavy burden of justifying the copying. Although some cases have held that the government must return copies of records where the originals were illegally seized&mdash;See, e.g., <em>United States v. Wallace & Tiernan Co</em>., 336 U.S. 793, 801 (1948); <em>Goodman v. United States</em>, 369 F.2d 166 (9th Cir. 1966)&mdash;these holdings are questionable in situations in which the government is permitted under Supreme Court decisions to use illegally seized evidence, and their reasoning does not apply to legally seized evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">As amended, Rule 41(e) avoids an all or nothing approach whereby the government must either return records and make no copies or keep originals notwithstanding the hardship to their owner. The amended rule recognizes that reasonable accommodations might protect both the law enforcement interests of the United States and the property rights of property owners and holders. In many instances documents and records that are relevant to ongoing or contemplated investigations and prosecutions may be returned to their owner as long as the government preserves a copy for future use. In some circumstances, however, equitable considerations might justify an order requiring the government to return or destroy all copies of records that it has seized. See, e.g., <em>Paton v. LaPrade</em>, 524 F.2d 862, 867&ndash;69 (3rd Cir. 1975). The amended rule contemplates judicial action that will respect both possessory and law enforcement interests.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;judge&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;court&rdquo; in the second sentence of subdivision (e) to clarify that a magistrate may receive evidence in the course of making a finding or a proposed finding for consideration by the district judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1990 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 41(a). The amendment to Rule 41(a) serves several purposes. First, it furthers the constitutional preference for warrants by providing a mechanism whereby a warrant may be issued in a district for a person or property that is moving into or through a district or might move outside the district while the warrant is sought or executed. Second, it clarifies the authority of federal magistrates to issue search warrants for property that is relevant to criminal investigation being conducted in a district and, although located outside the United States, that is in a place where the United States may lawfully conduct a search.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is not intended to expand the class of persons authorized to request a warrant and the language &ldquo;upon request of a federal law enforcement officer,&rdquo; modifies all warrants covered by Rule 41. The amendment is intended to make clear that judges of state courts of record within a federal district may issue search warrants for persons or property located within that district. The amendment does not prescribe the circumstances in which a warrant is required and is not intended to change the law concerning warrant requirements. Rather the rule provides a mechanism for the issuance of a warrant when one is required, or when a law enforcement officer desires to seek a warrant even though warrantless activity is permissible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 41(a)(1) permits anticipatory warrants by omitting the words &ldquo;is located,&rdquo; which in the past required that in all instances the object of the search had to be located within the district at the time the warrant was issued. Now a search for property or a person within the district, or expected to be within the district, is valid if it otherwise complies with the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 41(a)(2) authorizes execution of search warrants in another district under limited circumstances. Be<!-- PDFPage:132 -->cause these searches are unusual, the rule limits to federal magistrates the authority to issue such warrants. The rule permits a federal magistrate to issue a search warrant for property within the district which is moving or may move outside the district. The amendment recognizes that there are inevitable delays between the application for a warrant and its authorization, on the one hand, and the execution of the warrant, on the other hand. The amendment also recognizes that when property is in motion, there may be good reason to delay execution until the property comes to rest. The amendment provides a practical tool for federal law enforcement officers that avoids the necessity of their either seeking several warrants in different districts for the same property or their relying on an exception to the warrant requirement for search of property or a person that has moved outside a district.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment affords a useful warrant procedure to cover familiar fact patterns, like the one typified by <em>United States v. Chadwick</em>, 433 U.S. 1 (1976). In <em>Chadwick</em>, agents in San Diego observed suspicious activities involving a footlocker carried onto a train. When the train arrived in Boston, the agents made an arrest and conducted a warrantless search of the footlocker (which the Supreme Court held was invalid). Under the amended rule, agents who have probable cause in San Diego would be able to obtain a warrant for a search of the footlocker even though it is moving outside the district. Agents, who will not be sure exactly where the footlocker will be unloaded from the train, may execute the warrant when the journey ends. <em>See also United States v. Karo</em>, 468 U.S. 705 (1984) (rejecting argument that obtaining warrant to monitor beeper would not comply with requirement of particularity because its final destination may not be known); <em>United States v. Knotts</em>, 460 U.S. 276 (1983) (agents followed beeper across state lines). The Supreme Court's holding in <em>Chadwick</em> permits law enforcement officers to seize and hold an object like a footlocker while seeking a warrant. Although the amended rule would not disturb this holding, it provides a mechanism for agents to seek a probable cause determination and a warrant before interfering with the property and seizing it. It encourages reliance on warrants.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is not intended to abrogate the requirements of probable cause and prompt execution. At some point, a warrant issued in one district might become stale when executed in another district. But staleness can be a problem even when a warrant is executed in the district in which it was issued. <em>See generally United States v. Harris</em>, 403 U.S. 573, 579, 589 (1971). And at some point, an intervening event might make execution of a warrant unreasonable. <em>Cf. Illinois v. Andreas</em>, 463 U.S. 765, 772 (1983). Evaluations of the execution of a warrant must, in the nature of things, be made after the warrant is issued.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nor does the amendment abrogate the requirement of particularity. Thus, it does not authorize searches of premises other than a particular place. As recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Karo, supra</em>, although agents may not know exactly where moving property will come to rest, they can still describe with particularity the object to be searched.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment would authorize the search of a particular object or container provided that law enforcement officials were otherwise in a lawful position to execute the search without making an impermissible intrusion. For example, it would authorize the search of luggage moving aboard a plane.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 41(a)(3) [The Supreme Court did not adopt the addition of a subsection (3) to Rule 41(a)] provides for warrants to search property outside the United States. No provision for search warrants for persons is made lest the rule be read as a substitute for extradition proceedings. As with the provision for searches outside a district, <em>supra</em>, this provision is limited to search warrants issued by federal magistrates. The phrase &ldquo;relevant to criminal investigation&rdquo; is intended to encompass all of the types of property that are covered by Rule 41(b), which is unchanged by the amendment. That phrase also is intended to include those investigations which begin with the request for the search warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some searches and seizures by federal officers outside the territory of the United States may be governed by the fourth amendment. <em>See generally</em> Saltzburg, the Reach of the Bill of Rights Beyond the Terra Firma of the United States, 20 Va. J. Int'l L. 741 (1980). Prior to the amendment of the rule, it was unclear how federal officers might obtain warrants authorizing searches outside the district of the issuing magistrate. Military Rule of Evidence 315 provided guidance for searches of military personnel and property and nonmilitary property in a foreign country. But it had no civilian counterpart. <em>See generally</em> S. Saltzburg, L. Schinasi, & D. Schlueter, <em>Military Rules of Evidence Manual</em> 274&ndash;95 (2d ed. 1986).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the amendment rests on the assumption that the Constitution applies to some extraterritorial searches, <em>cf United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez</em>, 110 S. Ct. 1056, 494 U.S. 259 (1990) (fourth amendment inapplicable to extraterritorial searches of property owned by nonresident aliens), it does not address the question of when the Constitution requires a warrant. Nor does it address the issue of whether international agreements or treaties or the law of a foreign nation might be applicable. <em>See United States v. Patterson</em>, 812 F. 2d 486 (9th Cir. 1987). Instead, the amendment is intended to provide necessary clarification as to how a warrant may be obtained when law enforcement officials are required, or find it desirable, to do so.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 41(c)(2)(A) is intended to expand the authority of magistrates and judges in considering oral requests for search warrants. It also recognizes the value of, and the public's increased dependence on facsimile machines to transmit written information efficiently and accurately. As amended, the Rule should thus encourage law enforcement officers to seek a warrant, especially when it is necessary, or desirable, to supplement oral telephonic communications by written materials which may now be transmitted electronically as well. The magistrate issuing the warrant may require that the original affidavit be ultimately filed. The Committee considered, but rejected, amendments to the Rule which would have permitted other means of electronic transmission, such as the use of computer modems. In its view, facsimile transmissions provide some method of assuring the authenticity of the writing transmitted by the affiant.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee considered amendments to Rule 41(c)(2)(B), Application, Rule 41(c)(2)(C), Issuance, and Rule 41(g), Return of Papers to Clerk, but determined that allowing use of facsimile transmissions in those instances would not save time and would present problems and questions concerning the need to preserve facsimile copies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is also amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule-making power of the Supreme Court with respect to criminal proceedings was extended to proceedings to punish for criminal contempt of court by the Act of November 21, 1941 (55 Stat. 779), 18 U.S.C. 689 [see 3771, 3772].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law, <em>Ex parte Terry</em>, 128 U.S. 289; <em>Cooke v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 517, 534.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). 1. This rule is substantially a restatement of the procedure prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 386&ndash;390 [now 18 U.S.C. 401, 402, 3285, 3691], and 29 U.S.C. 111 [now 18 U.S.C. 3692].</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The requirement in the second sentence that the notice shall describe the criminal contempt as such is intended to obviate the frequent confusion between criminal and civil contempt proceedings and follows the suggestion made in <em>McCann v. New York Stock Exchange</em>, 80 F.2d 211 (C.C.A. 2d). See also <em>Nye v. United States</em>, 313 U.S. 33, 42&ndash;43.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The fourth sentence relating to trial by jury preserves the right to a trial by jury in those contempt cases in which it is granted by statute, but does not enlarge the right or extend it to additional cases. The respondent in a contempt proceeding may demand a trial by jury as of right if the proceeding is brought under the Act of March 23, 1932, c. 90, sec. 11, 47 Stat. 72, 29 U.S.C. 111 [now 18 U.S.C. 3692] (Norris-La Guardia Act), or the Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, sec. 22, 38 Stat. 738, 28 U.S.C. 387 (Clayton Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The provision in the sixth sentence disqualifying the judge affected by the contempt if the charge involves disrespect to or criticism of him, is based, in part, on 29 U.S.C. former &sect;112 (Contempts; demand for retirement of judge sitting in proceeding) and the observations of Chief Justice Taft in <em>Cooke v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 517, 539, 45 S.Ct. 390, 69 L.Ed. 767.</p>
