<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. The Constitution of the United States, Article III. Section 2, Paragraph 3, provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Amendment VI provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body-block">28 U.S.C. former &sect;114 (now &sect;&sect;1393, 1441) provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">All prosecutions for crimes or offenses shall be had within the division of such districts where the same were committed, unless the court, or the judge thereof, upon the application of the defendant, shall order the cause to be transferred for prosecution to another division of the district.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The word &ldquo;prosecutions,&rdquo; as used in this statute, does not include the finding and return of an indictment. The prevailing practice of impaneling a grand jury for the entire district at a session in some division and of distributing the indictments among the divisions in which the offenses were committed is deemed proper <!-- PDFPage:81 -->and legal, <em>Salinger v. Loisel</em>, 265 U.S. 224, 237. The court stated that this practice is &ldquo;attended with real advantages.&rdquo; The rule is a restatement of existing law and is intended to sanction the continuance of this practice. For this reason, the rule requires that only the trial be held in the division in which the offense was committed and permits other proceedings to be had elsewhere in the same district.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Within the framework of the foregoing constitutional provisions and the provisions of the general statute, 28 U.S.C. 114 [now 1393, 1441], <em>supra</em>, numerous statutes have been enacted to regulate the venue of criminal proceedings, particularly in respect to continuing offenses and offenses consisting of several transactions occurring in different districts. <em>Armour Packing Co. v. United States</em>, 209 U.S. 56, 73&ndash;77; <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 323 U.S. 273. These special venue provisions are not affected by the rule. Among these statutes are the following:</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment eliminates the requirement that the prosecution shall be in a division in which the offense was committed and vests discretion in the court to fix the place of trial at any place within the district with due regard to the convenience of the defendant and his witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Sixth Amendment provides that the defendant shall have the right to a trial &ldquo;by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; There is no constitutional right to trial within a division. See <em>United States v. Anderson</em>, 328 U.S. 699, 704, 705 (1946); <em>Barrett v. United States</em>, 169 U.S. 218 (1898); <em>Lafoon v. United States</em>, 250 F.2d 958 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Carrillo v. Squier</em>, 137 F.2d 648 (9th Cir. 1943); <em>McNealey v. Johnston</em>, 100 F.2d 280, 282 (9th Cir. 1938). Cf. <em>Platt v. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co</em>., 376 U.S. 240 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">The former requirement for venue within the division operated in an irrational fashion. Divisions have been created in only half of the districts, and the differentiation between those districts with and those without divisions often bears no relationship to comparative size or population. In many districts a single judge is required to sit in several divisions and only brief and infrequent terms may be held in particular divisions. As a consequence under the original rule there was often undue delay in the disposition of criminal cases&mdash;delay which was particularly serious with respect to defendants who had been unable to secure release on bail pending the holding of the next term of court.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court is satisfied that there exists in the place fixed for trial prejudice against the defendant so great as to render the trial unfair, the court may, of course, fix another place of trial within the district (if there be such) where such prejudice does not exist. Cf. Rule 21 dealing with transfers between districts.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment is intended to eliminate an inconsistency between rule 18, which in its present form has <!-- PDFPage:82 -->been interpreted not to allow trial in a division other than that in which the offense was committed except as dictated by the convenience of the defendant and witnesses, <em>Dupoint v. United States</em>, 388 F.2d 39 (5th Cir. 1968), and the Speedy Trial Act of 1974. This Act provides:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">In any case involving a defendant charged with an offense, the appropriate judicial officer, at the earliest practicable time, shall, after consultation with the counsel for the defendant and the attorney for the Government, set the case for trial on a day certain, or list it for trial on a weekly or other short-term trial calendar at a place within the judicial district so as to assure a speedy trial.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">18 U.S.C. &sect;3161(a). This provision is intended to &ldquo;permit the trial of a case at any place within the judicial district. This language was included in anticipation of problems which might occur in districts with statutory divisions, where it could be difficult to set trial outside the division.&rdquo; H.R.Rep. No. 93&ndash;1508, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1974).</p>
<p class="note-body">The change does not offend the venue or vicinage provisions of the Constitution. Article III, &sect;2, clause 3 places venue (the geographical location of the trial) &ldquo;in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed,&rdquo; while the Sixth Amendment defines the vicinage (the geographical location of the jurors) as &ldquo;the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.&rdquo; The latter provision makes &ldquo;no reference to a division within a judicial district.&rdquo; <em>United States v. James</em>, 528 F.2d 999 (5th Cir. 1976). &ldquo;It follows a fortiori that when a district is not separated into divisions,&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* trial at any place within the district is allowable under the Sixth Amendment&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Fernandez</em>, 480 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1973). See also <em>Zicarelli v. Gray</em>, 543 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1976) and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nor is the change inconsistent with the Declaration of Policy in the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, which reads:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">It is the policy of the United States that all litigants in Federal courts entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">28 U.S.C. &sect;1861. This language does not mean that the Act requires &ldquo;the trial court to convene not only in the district but also in the division wherein the offense occurred,&rdquo; as:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">There is no hint in the statutory history that the Jury Selection Act was intended to do more than provide improved judicial machinery so that grand and petit jurors would be selected at random by the use of objective qualification criteria to ensure a representative cross section of the district or division in which the grand or petit jury sits. <em>United States v. Cates</em>, 485 F.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to rule 18 does not eliminate either of the existing considerations which bear upon fixing the place of trial within a district, but simply adds yet another consideration in the interest of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974. The amendment does not authorize the fixing of the place of trial for yet other reasons. Cf. <em>United States v. Fernandez</em>, 480 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1973) (court in the exercise of its supervisory power held improper the fixing of the place of trial &ldquo;for no apparent reason other than the convenience of the judge&rdquo;).</p>
