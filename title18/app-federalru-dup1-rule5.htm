<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5. Initial Appearance Before the Magistrate Judge</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, an officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, if a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041. If a person arrested without a warrant is brought before a magistrate judge, a complaint, satisfying the probable cause requirements of Rule 4(a), shall be promptly filed. When a person, arrested with or without a warrant or given a summons, appears initially before the magistrate judge, the magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with the applicable subdivisions of this rule. An officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint charging solely a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073 need not comply with this rule if the person arrested is transferred without unnecessary delay to the custody of appropriate state or local authorities in the district of arrest and an attorney for the government moves promptly, in the district in which the warrant was issued, to dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Misdemeanors and Other Petty Offenses</cap-smallcap>. If the charge against the defendant is a misdemeanor or other petty offense triable by a United States magistrate judge under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401, the magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with Rule 58.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Offenses Not Triable by the United States Magistrate Judge</cap-smallcap>. If the charge against the defendant is not triable by the United States magistrate judge, the defendant shall not be called upon to plead. The magistrate judge shall inform the defendant of the complaint against the defendant and of any affidavit filed therewith, of the defendant's right to retain counsel or to request the assignment of counsel if the defendant is unable to obtain counsel, and of the general circumstances under which the defendant may secure pretrial release. The magistrate judge shall inform the defendant that the defendant is not required to make a statement and that any statement made by the defendant may be used against the defendant. The magistrate judge shall also inform the defendant of the right to a preliminary examination. The magistrate judge shall allow the defendant reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel and shall detain or conditionally release the defendant as provided by statute or in these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A defendant is entitled to a preliminary examination, unless waived, when charged with any offense, other than a petty offense, which is to be tried by a judge of the district court. If the defendant waives preliminary examination, the magistrate judge shall forthwith hold the defendant to answer in the district court. If the defendant does not waive the preliminary examination, the magistrate judge shall schedule a preliminary examination. Such examination shall be held within a reasonable time but in any event not later than 10 days following the initial appearance if the defendant is in custody and no later than 20 days if the defendant is not in custody, provided, however, that the preliminary examination shall not be held if the defendant is indicted or if an information against the defendant is filed in district court before the date set for the preliminary examination. With the consent of the defendant and upon a showing of good cause, taking into account the public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases, time limits specified in this subdivision may be extended one or more times by a federal magistrate judge. In the absence of such consent by the defendant, time limits may be extended by a judge of the United States only upon a showing that extraordinary circumstances exist and that delay is indispensable to the interests of justice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The time within which a prisoner must be brought before a committing magistrate is defined differently in different statutes. The rule supersedes all statutory provisions on this point and fixes a single standard, i.e., &ldquo;without unnecessary delay&rdquo;, 18 U.S.C. [former] 593 (Operating illicit distillery; arrest; bail); sec. [former] 595 (Persons arrested taken before nearest officer for hearing); 5 U.S.C. 300a [now 18 U.S.C. 3052, 3107] (Division of Investigation; authority of officers to serve warrants and make arrests); 16 U.S.C. 10 (Arrests by employees of park service for violations of laws and regulations); sec. 706 (Migratory Bird Treaty Act; arrests; search warrants); D.C. Code (1940), Title 4, sec. 140 (Arrests without warrant); see, also, 33 U.S.C. 436, 446, 452; 46 U.S.C. 708 [now 18 U.S.C. 2279]. What constitutes &ldquo;unnecessary delay&rdquo;, i.e., reasonable time within which the prisoner should be brought before a committing magistrate, must be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances of the case. The following authorities discuss the question what constitutes reasonable time for this purpose in various situations: <em>Carroll v. Parry</em>, 48 App.D.C. 453; <em>Janus v. United States</em>, 38 F.2d 431 (C.C.A. 9th); <em>Commonwealth v. Di Stasio</em>, 294 Mass. 273; <em>State v. Freeman</em>, 86 N.C. 683; <em>Peloquin v. Hibner</em>, 231 Wis. 77; see, also, Warner, 28 Va.L.R. 315, 339&ndash;341.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule also states the prevailing state practice, A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), Commentaries to secs. 35, 36.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions</em> (b) and (c). 1. These rules prescribe a uniform procedure to be followed at preliminary hearings before a commissioner. They supersede the general provisions of 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial). The procedure prescribed by the rules is that generally prevailing. See <em>Wood v. United States</em>, 128 F.2d 265, 271&ndash;272 (App. D.C.); A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), secs. 39&ndash;60 and Commentaries thereto; <em>Manual for United States Commissioners</em>, pp. 6&ndash;10, published by Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Pleas before a commissioner are excluded, as a plea of guilty at this stage has no legal status or function except to serve as a waiver of preliminary examination. It has been held inadmissible in evidence at the trial, if the defendant was not represented by counsel when the plea was entered. <em>Wood v. United States</em>, 128 F.2d 265 (App. D.C.) The rule expressly provides for a waiver of examination, thereby eliminating any necessity for a provision as to plea.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first change is designed to insure that under the revision made in Rule 4(a) the defendant arrested on a warrant will receive the same information concerning the basis for the issuance of the warrant as would previously have been given him by the complaint itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second change obligates the commissioner to inform the defendant of his right to request the assignment of counsel if he is unable to obtain counsel. Cf. the amendment to Rule 44, and the Advisory Committee's Note thereon.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">There are a number of changes made in rule 5 which are designed to improve the editorial clarity of the rule; to conform the rule to the Federal Magistrates Act; and to deal explicitly in the rule with issues as to which the rule was silent and the law uncertain.</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal editorial change is to deal separately with the initial appearance before the magistrate and the preliminary examination. They are dealt with together in old rule 5. They are separated in order to prevent confusion as to whether they constitute a single or two separate proceedings. Although the preliminary examination can be held at the time of the initial appearance, in practice this ordinarily does not occur. Usually counsel need time to prepare for the preliminary examination and as a consequence a separate date is typically set for the preliminary examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because federal magistrates are reasonably available to conduct initial appearances, the rule is drafted on the assumption that the initial appearance is before a federal magistrate. If experience under the act indicates that there must be frequent appearances before state or local judicial officers it may be desirable to draft an additional rule, such as the following, detailing the procedure for an initial appearance before a state or local judicial officer:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Initial Appearance Before a State or Local Judicial Officer</em>. If a United States magistrate is not reasonably available under rule 5(a), the arrested person shall be brought before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041, and such officer shall inform the person of the rights specified in rule 5(c) and shall authorize the release of the arrested person under the terms provided for by these rules and by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146. The judicial officer shall immediately transmit any written order of release and any papers filed before him to the appropriate United States magistrate of the district and order the arrested person to appear before such United States magistrate within three days if not in custody or at the next regular hour of business of the United States magistrate if the arrested person is retained in custody. Upon his appearance before the United States magistrate, the procedure shall be that prescribed in rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several changes are made to conform the language of the rule to the Federal Magistrates Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The term &ldquo;magistrate,&rdquo; which is defined in new rule 54, is substituted for the term &ldquo;commissioner.&rdquo; As defined, &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; includes those state and local judicial officers specified in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041, and thus the initial appearance may be before a state or local judicial officer when a federal magistrate is not reasonably available. This is made explicit in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Subdivision (b) conforms the rule to the procedure prescribed in the Federal Magistrate Act when a defendant appears before a magistrate charged with a &ldquo;minor offense&rdquo; as defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(f):</p>
<p class="note-body-block">&ldquo;misdemeanors punishable under the laws of the United States, the penalty for which does not exceed imprisonment for a period of one year, or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both, except that such term does not include .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [specified exceptions].&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">If the &ldquo;minor offense&rdquo; is tried before a United States magistrate, the procedure must be in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before United States Magistrates, (January 27, 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Subdivision (d) makes clear that a defendant is not entitled to a preliminary examination if he has been indicted by a grand jury prior to the date set for the preliminary examination or, in appropriate cases, if any information is filed in the district court prior to that date. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80, pp. 137&ndash;140 (1969, Supp. 1971). This is also provided in the Federal Magistrates Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5 is also amended to deal with several issues not dealt with in old rule 5:</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to make clear that a complaint, complying with the requirements of rule 4(a), must be filed whenever a person has been arrested without a warrant. This means that the complaint, or an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint, must show probable cause. As provided in rule 4(a) the showing of probable cause &ldquo;may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that defendant should be notified of the general circumstances under which he is entitled to pretrial release under the Bail Reform Act of 1966 (18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3141&ndash;3152). Defendants often do not in fact have counsel at the initial appearance and thus, unless told by the magistrate, may be unaware of their right to pretrial release. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;78 N. 61 (1969).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:22 --><p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) makes clear that a defendant who does not waive his right to trial before a judge of the district court is entitled to a preliminary examination to determine probable cause for any offense except a petty offense. It also, by necessary implication, makes clear that a defendant is not entitled to a preliminary examination if he consents to be tried on the issue of guilt or innocence by the United States magistrate, even though the offense may be one not heretofore triable by the United States commissioner and therefore one as to which the defendant had a right to a preliminary examination. The rationale is that the preliminary examination serves only to justify holding the defendant in custody or on bail during the period of time it takes to bind the defendant over to the district court for trial. See <em>State v. Solomon</em>, 158 Wis. 146, 147 N.W. 640 (1914). A similar conclusion is reached in the New York Proposed Criminal Procedure Law. See McKinney's Session Law News, April 10, 1969, at p. A&ndash;119.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) also contains time limits within which the preliminary examination must be held. These are taken from 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060. The provisions for the extension of the prescribed time limits are the same as the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060 with two exceptions: The new language allows delay consented to by the defendant only if there is &ldquo;a showing of good cause, taking into account the public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases.&rdquo; This reflects the view of the Advisory Committee that delay, whether prosecution or defense induced, ought to be avoided whenever possible. The second difference between the new rule and 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060 is that the rule allows the decision to grant a continuance to be made by a United States magistrate as well as by a judge of the United States. This reflects the view of the Advisory Committee that the United States magistrate should have sufficient judicial competence to make decisions such as that contemplated in subdivision (c).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of subdivision (b) reflects the recent amendment of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(a), by the Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, to read: &ldquo;When specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or courts he serves, any United States magistrate shall have jurisdiction to try persons accused of, and sentence persons convicted of, misdemeanors committed within that judicial district.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1990 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b) is amended to conform the rule to Rule 58.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 5 is intended to address the interplay between the requirements for a prompt appearance before a magistrate judge and the processing of persons arrested for the offense of unlawfully fleeing to avoid prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073, when no federal prosecution is intended. Title 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073 provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Whoever moves or travels in interstate or foreign commerce with intent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, under the laws of the place from which he flees .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Violations of this section may be prosecuted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only upon formal approval in writing by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General of the United States, which function of approving prosecutions may not be delegated.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">In enacting &sect;1073, Congress apparently intended to provide assistance to state criminal justice authorities in an effort to apprehend and prosecute state offenders. It also appears that by requiring permission of high ranking officials, Congress intended that prosecutions be limited in number. In fact, prosecutions under this section have been rare. The purpose of the statute is fulfilled when the person is apprehended and turned over to state or local authorities. In such cases the requirement of Rule 5 that any person arrested under a federal warrant must be brought before a federal magistrate judge becomes a largely meaningless exercise and a needless demand upon federal judicial resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addressing this problem, several options are available to federal authorities when no federal prosecution is intended to ensue after the arrest. First, once federal authorities locate a fugitive, they may contact local law enforcement officials who make the arrest based upon the underlying out-of-state warrant. In that instance, Rule 5 is not implicated and the United States Attorney in the district issuing the &sect;1073 complaint and warrant can take action to dismiss both. In a second scenario, the fugitive is arrested by federal authorities who, in compliance with Rule 5, bring the person before a federal magistrate judge. If local law enforcement officers are present, they can take custody, once the United States Attorney informs the magistrate judge that there will be no prosecution under &sect;1073. Depending on the availability of state or local officers, there may be some delay in the Rule 5 proceedings; any delays following release to local officials, however, would not be a function of Rule 5. In a third situation, federal authorities arrest the fugitive but local law enforcement authorities are not present at the Rule 5 appearance. Depending on a variety of practices, the magistrate judge may calendar a removal hearing under Rule 40, or order that the person be held in federal custody pending further action by the local authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment, officers arresting a fugitive charged only with violating &sect;1073 need not bring the person before a magistrate judge under Rule 5(a) if there is no intent to actually prosecute the person under that charge. Two requirements, however, must be met. First, the arrested fugitive must be transferred without unnecessary delay to the custody of state officials. Second, steps must be taken in the appropriate district to dismiss the complaint alleging a violation of &sect;1073. The rule continues to contemplate that persons arrested by federal officials are entitled to prompt handling of federal charges, if prosecution is intended, and prompt transfer to state custody if federal prosecution is not contemplated.</p>
