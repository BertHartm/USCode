<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body">In particular, Rule 2 has been amended to clarify the purpose of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. The words &ldquo;are intended&rdquo; have been changed to read &ldquo;are to be interpreted.&rdquo; The Committee believed that that was the original intent of the drafters and more accurately reflects the purpose of the rules.</p>
