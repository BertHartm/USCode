<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Any property, real or personal, involved in a violation or attempted violation, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to a violation, of section 2339C of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;proceeds&rdquo; is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In cases involving illegal goods, illegal services, unlawful activities, and telemarketing and health care fraud schemes, the term &ldquo;proceeds&rdquo; means property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly, as the result of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture, and any property traceable thereto, and is not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In cases involving lawful goods or lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner, the term &ldquo;proceeds&rdquo; means the amount of money acquired through the illegal transactions resulting in the forfeiture, less the direct costs incurred in providing the goods or services. The claimant shall have the burden of proof with respect to the issue of direct costs. The direct costs shall not include any part of the overhead expenses of the entity providing the goods or services, or any part of the income taxes paid by the entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In cases involving fraud in the process of obtaining a loan or extension of credit, the court shall allow the claimant a deduction from the forfeiture to the extent that the loan was repaid, or the debt was satisfied, without any financial loss to the victim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in section 985, any property subject to forfeiture to the United States under subsection (a) may be seized by the Attorney General and, in the case of property involved in a violation investigated by the Secretary of the Treasury or the United States Postal Service, the property may also be seized by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Postal Service, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Seizures pursuant to this section shall be made pursuant to a warrant obtained in the same manner as provided for a search warrant under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, except that a seizure may be made without a warrant if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a complaint for forfeiture has been filed in the United States district court and the court issued an arrest warrant in rem pursuant to the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the seizure is made pursuant to a lawful arrest or search; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) another exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement would apply; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the property was lawfully seized by a State or local law enforcement agency and transferred to a Federal agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of rule 41(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a seizure warrant may be issued pursuant to this subsection by a judicial officer in any district in which a forfeiture action against the property may be filed under section 1355(b) of title 28, and may be executed in any district in which the property is found, or transmitted to the central authority of any foreign state for service in accordance with any treaty or other international agreement. Any motion for the return of property seized under this section shall be filed in the district court in which the seizure warrant was issued or in the district court for the district in which the property was seized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If any person is arrested or charged in a foreign country in connection with an offense that would give rise to the forfeiture of property in the United States under this section or under the Controlled Substances Act, the Attorney General may apply to any Federal judge or magistrate judge in the district in which the property is located for an ex parte order restraining the property subject to forfeiture for not more than 30 days, except that the time may be extended for good cause shown at a hearing conducted in the manner provided in rule 43(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The application for the restraining order shall set forth the nature and circumstances of the foreign charges and the basis for belief that the person arrested or charged has property in the United States that would be subject to forfeiture, and shall contain a statement that the restraining order is needed to preserve the availability of property for such time as is necessary to receive evidence from the foreign country or elsewhere in support of probable cause for the seizure of the property under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Property taken or detained under this section shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, subject only to the orders and decrees of the court or the official having jurisdiction thereof. Whenever property is seized under this subsection, the Attor<!-- PDFPage:239 -->ney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) place the property under seal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) remove the property to a place designated by him; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require that the General Services Administration take custody of the property and remove it, if practicable, to an appropriate location for disposition in accordance with law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) For purposes of this section, the provisions of the customs laws relating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture, condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws, the disposition of such property or the proceeds from the sale of such property under this section, the remission or mitigation of such forfeitures, and the compromise of claims (19 U.S.C. 1602 et seq.), insofar as they are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been incurred, under this section, except that such duties as are imposed upon the customs officer or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of property under the customs laws shall be performed with respect to seizures and forfeitures of property under this section by such officers, agents, or other persons as may be authorized or designated for that purpose by the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be. The Attorney General shall have sole responsibility for disposing of petitions for remission or mitigation with respect to property involved in a judicial forfeiture proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, except section 3 of the Anti Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, is authorized to retain property forfeited pursuant to this section, or to transfer such property on such terms and conditions as he may determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to any other Federal agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to any State or local law enforcement agency which participated directly in any of the acts which led to the seizure or forfeiture of the property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C), to any Federal financial institution regulatory agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to reimburse the agency for payments to claimants or creditors of the institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to reimburse the insurance fund of the agency for losses suffered by the fund as a result of the receivership or liquidation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C), upon the order of the appropriate Federal financial institution regulatory agency, to the financial institution as restitution, with the value of the property so transferred to be set off against any amount later recovered by the financial institution as compensatory damages in any State or Federal proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(C), to any Federal financial institution regulatory agency, to the extent of the agency's contribution of resources to, or expenses involved in, the seizure and forfeiture, and the investigation leading directly to the seizure and forfeiture, of such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) as restoration to any victim of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture, including, in the case of a money laundering offense, any offense constituting the underlying specified unlawful activity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In&nbsp;<sup><a href="#981_1_target" name="981_1">1</a></sup> the case of property referred to in subsection (a)(1)(D), to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other Federal financial institution regulatory agency (as defined in section 8(e)(7)(D) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, shall ensure the equitable transfer pursuant to paragraph (2) of any forfeited property to the appropriate State or local law enforcement agency so as to reflect generally the contribution of any such agency participating directly in any of the acts which led to the seizure or forfeiture of such property. A decision by the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service pursuant to paragraph (2) shall not be subject to review. The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of the use of any property the custody of which was transferred pursuant to this section to any non-Federal agency. The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service may order the discontinuance of any forfeiture proceedings under this section in favor of the institution of forfeiture proceedings by State or local authorities under an appropriate State or local statute. After the filing of a complaint for forfeiture under this section, the Attorney General may seek dismissal of the complaint in favor of forfeiture proceedings under State or local law. Whenever forfeiture proceedings are discontinued by the United States in favor of State or local proceedings, the United States may transfer custody and possession of the seized property to the appropriate State or local official immediately upon the initiation of the proper actions by such officials. Whenever forfeiture proceedings are discontinued by the United States in favor of State or local proceedings, notice shall be sent to all known interested parties advising them of the discontinuance or dismissal. The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of the seizure, detention, and transfer of seized property to State or local officials. The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of a transfer under paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) All right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a) of this section shall vest in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Upon the motion of the United States, the court shall stay the civil forfeiture proceeding if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the Government to conduct a related criminal investiga<!-- PDFPage:240 -->tion or the prosecution of a related criminal case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the motion of a claimant, the court shall stay the civil forfeiture proceeding with respect to that claimant if the court determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the claimant is the subject of a related criminal investigation or case;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the claimant has standing to assert a claim in the civil forfeiture proceeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) continuation of the forfeiture proceeding will burden the right of the claimant against self-incrimination in the related investigation or case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to the impact of civil discovery described in paragraphs (1) and (2), the court may determine that a stay is unnecessary if a protective order limiting discovery would protect the interest of one party without unfairly limiting the ability of the opposing party to pursue the civil case. In no case, however, shall the court impose a protective order as an alternative to a stay if the effect of such protective order would be to allow one party to pursue discovery while the other party is substantially unable to do so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection, the terms &ldquo;related criminal case&rdquo; and &ldquo;related criminal investigation&rdquo; mean an actual prosecution or investigation in progress at the time at which the request for the stay, or any subsequent motion to lift the stay is made. In determining whether a criminal case or investigation is &ldquo;related&rdquo; to a civil forfeiture proceeding, the court shall consider the degree of similarity between the parties, witnesses, facts, and circumstances involved in the two proceedings, without requiring an identity with respect to any one or more factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In requesting a stay under paragraph (1), the Government may, in appropriate cases, submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect an ongoing criminal investigation or pending criminal trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Whenever a civil forfeiture proceeding is stayed pursuant to this subsection, the court shall enter any order necessary to preserve the value of the property or to protect the rights of lienholders or other persons with an interest in the property while the stay is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A determination by the court that the claimant has standing to request a stay pursuant to paragraph (2) shall apply only to this subsection and shall not preclude the Government from objecting to the standing of the claimant by dispositive motion or at the time of trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) In addition to the venue provided for in section 1395 of title 28 or any other provision of law, in the case of property of a defendant charged with a violation that is the basis for forfeiture of the property under this section, a proceeding for forfeiture under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant owning such property is found or in the judicial district in which the criminal prosecution is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) Whenever property is civilly or criminally forfeited under this chapter, the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury, as the case may be, may transfer the forfeited personal property or the proceeds of the sale of any forfeited personal or real property to any foreign country which participated directly or indirectly in the seizure or forfeiture of the property, if such a transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has been agreed to by the Secretary of State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is authorized in an international agreement between the United States and the foreign country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is made to a country which, if applicable, has been certified under section 481(h)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#981_2_target" name="981_2">2</a></sup> of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A decision by the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to review. The foreign country shall, in the event of a transfer of property or proceeds of sale of property under this subsection, bear all expenses incurred by the United States in the seizure, maintenance, inventory, storage, forfeiture, and disposition of the property, and all transfer costs. The payment of all such expenses, and the transfer of assets pursuant to this paragraph, shall be upon such terms and conditions as the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury may, in his discretion, set.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of this section shall not be construed as limiting or superseding any other authority of the United States to provide assistance to a foreign country in obtaining property related to a crime committed in the foreign country, including property which is sought as evidence of a crime committed in the foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A certified order or judgment of forfeiture by a court of competent jurisdiction of a foreign country concerning property which is the subject of forfeiture under this section and was determined by such court to be the type of property described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, and any certified recordings or transcripts of testimony taken in a foreign judicial proceeding concerning such order or judgment of forfeiture, shall be admissible in evidence in a proceeding brought pursuant to this section. Such certified order or judgment of forfeiture, when admitted into evidence, shall constitute probable cause that the property forfeited by such order or judgment of forfeiture is subject to forfeiture under this section and creates a rebuttable presumption of the forfeitability of such property under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A certified order or judgment of conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction of a foreign country concerning an unlawful drug activity which gives rise to forfeiture under this section and any certified recordings or transcripts of testimony taken in a foreign judicial proceeding concerning such order or judgment of conviction shall be admissible in evidence in a proceeding brought pursuant to this section. Such certified order or judgment of conviction, when admitted into evidence, creates a rebuttable presumption that the unlawful drug activity giving rise to forfeiture under this section has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection shall not be construed as limit<!-- PDFPage:241 -->ing the admissibility of any evidence otherwise admissible, nor shall they limit the ability of the United States to establish probable cause that property is subject to forfeiture by any evidence otherwise admissible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; means the Attorney General or his delegate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; means the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Interbank Accounts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purpose of a forfeiture under this section or under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), if funds are deposited into an account at a foreign bank, and that foreign bank has an interbank account in the United States with a covered financial institution (as defined in section 5318(j)(1) of title 31), the funds shall be deemed to have been deposited into the interbank account in the United States, and any restraining order, seizure warrant, or arrest warrant in rem regarding the funds may be served on the covered financial institution, and funds in the interbank account, up to the value of the funds deposited into the account at the foreign bank, may be restrained, seized, or arrested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Authority to suspend</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, may suspend or terminate a forfeiture under this section if the Attorney General determines that a conflict of law exists between the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign bank is located and the laws of the United States with respect to liabilities arising from the restraint, seizure, or arrest of such funds, and that such suspension or termination would be in the interest of justice and would not harm the national interests of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>No requirement for government to trace funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a forfeiture action is brought against funds that are restrained, seized, or arrested under paragraph (1), it shall not be necessary for the Government to establish that the funds are directly traceable to the funds that were deposited into the foreign bank, nor shall it be necessary for the Government to rely on the application of section 984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Claims brought by owner of the funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a forfeiture action is instituted against funds restrained, seized, or arrested under paragraph (1), the owner of the funds deposited into the account at the foreign bank may contest the forfeiture by filing a claim under section 983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Interbank account</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;interbank account&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 984(c)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Owner.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in clause (ii), the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) means the person who was the owner, as that term is defined in section 983(d)(6), of the funds that were deposited into the foreign bank at the time such funds were deposited; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) If a person with standing to contest the forfeiture of property in a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute is financially unable to obtain representation by counsel, and the property subject to forfeiture is real property that is being used by the person as a primary residence, the court, at the request of the person, shall insure that the person is represented by an attorney for the Legal Services Corporation with respect to the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) At appropriate times during a representation under subparagraph (A), the Legal Services Corporation shall submit a statement of reasonable attorney fees and costs to the court.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) For the purposes of this paragraph, ways in which a person may show that such person did all that reasonably could be expected may include demonstrating that such person, to the extent permitted by law&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An otherwise valid claim under subparagraph (A) shall not be denied on the ground that the claimant gave nothing of value in exchange for the property if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the property is the primary residence of the claimant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) depriving the claimant of the property would deprive the claimant of the means to maintain reasonable shelter in the community for the claimant and all dependents residing with the claimant;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the claimant acquired his or her interest in the property through marriage, divorce, or legal separation, or the claimant was the spouse or legal dependent of a person whose death resulted in the transfer of the property to the claimant through inheritance or probate,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that the court shall limit the value of any real property interest for which innocent ownership is recognized under this subparagraph to the value necessary to maintain reasonable shelter in the community for such claimant and all dependents residing with the claimant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, no person may assert an ownership interest under this subsection in contraband or other property that it is illegal to possess.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If the court determines, in accordance with this section, that an innocent owner has a partial interest in property otherwise subject to forfeiture, or a joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety in such property, the court may enter an appropriate order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) severing the property;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Motion To Set Aside Forfeiture.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Government knew, or reasonably should have known, of the moving party's interest and failed to take reasonable steps to provide such party with notice; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the moving party did not know or have reason to know of the seizure within sufficient time to file a timely claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Notwithstanding the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, if the court grants a motion under paragraph (1), the court shall set aside the declaration of forfeiture as to the interest of the moving party without prejudice to the right of the Government to commence a subsequent forfeiture proceeding as to the interest of the moving party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any proceeding described in subparagraph (A) shall be commenced&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) if nonjudicial, within 60 days of the entry of the order granting the motion; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A motion filed under this subsection shall be the exclusive remedy for seeking to set aside a declaration of forfeiture under a civil forfeiture statute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Release Of Seized Property.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the claimant has sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will be available at the time of the trial;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the continued possession by the Government pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing the functioning of a business, preventing an individual from working, or leaving an individual homeless;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by the Government of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) none of the conditions set forth in paragraph (8) applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A claimant seeking release of property under this subsection must request possession of the property from the appropriate official, and the request must set forth the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (1) are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) If not later than 15 days after the date of a request under paragraph (2) the property has not been released, the claimant may file a petition in the district court in which the complaint has been filed or, if no complaint has been filed, in the district court in which the seizure warrant was issued or in the district court for the district in which the property was seized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The petition described in subparagraph (A) shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (1) are met; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the steps the claimant has taken to secure release of the property from the appropriate official.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Government establishes that the claimant's claim is frivolous, the court shall deny the petition. In responding to a petition under this subsection on other grounds, the Government may in appropriate cases submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect an ongoing criminal investigation or pending criminal trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The court shall render a decision on a petition filed under paragraph (3) not later than 30 days after the date of the filing, unless such 30-day limitation is extended by consent of the parties or by the court for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a petition is filed under paragraph (3); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the claimant demonstrates that the requirements of paragraph (1) have been met,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the district court shall order that the property be returned to the claimant, pending completion of proceedings by the Government to obtain forfeiture of the property.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Government may place a lien against the property or file a lis pendens to ensure that the property is not transferred to another person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:250 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) This subsection shall not apply if the seized property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is contraband, currency, or other monetary instrument, or electronic funds unless such currency or other monetary instrument or electronic funds constitutes the assets of a legitimate business which has been seized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is to be used as evidence of a violation of the law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by reason of design or other characteristic, is particularly suited for use in illegal activities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) is likely to be used to commit additional criminal acts if returned to the claimant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Proportionality.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The claimant under subsection (a)(4) may petition the court to determine whether the forfeiture was constitutionally excessive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In making this determination, the court shall compare the forfeiture to the gravity of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The claimant shall have the burden of establishing that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional by a preponderance of the evidence at a hearing conducted by the court without a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the court finds that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the offense it shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture as necessary to avoid a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Civil Fine.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In any civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute in which the Government prevails, if the court finds that the claimant's assertion of an interest in the property was frivolous, the court may impose a civil fine on the claimant of an amount equal to 10 percent of the value of the forfeited property, but in no event shall the fine be less than $250 or greater than $5,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any civil fine imposed under this subsection shall not preclude the court from imposing sanctions under rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In addition to the limitations of section 1915 of title 28, United States Code, in no event shall a prisoner file a claim under a civil forfeiture statute or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding based on a civil forfeiture statute if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous or malicious, unless the prisoner shows extraordinary and exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, create receiverships, appoint conservators, custodians, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to seize, secure, maintain, or preserve the availability of property subject to civil forfeiture&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) upon the filing of a civil forfeiture complaint alleging that the property with respect to which the order is sought is subject to civil forfeiture; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) prior to the filing of such a complaint, if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a substantial probability that the United States will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An order entered pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be effective for not more than 90 days, unless extended by the court for good cause shown, or unless a complaint described in paragraph (1)(A) has been filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A temporary restraining order under this subsection may be entered upon application of the United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing when a complaint has not yet been filed with respect to the property, if the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought is subject to civil forfeiture and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture. Such a temporary order shall expire not more than 10 days after the date on which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held pursuant to this subsection, evidence and information that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) real property that is the subject of a civil forfeiture action shall not be seized before entry of an order of forfeiture; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owners or occupants of the real property shall not be evicted from, or otherwise deprived of the use and enjoyment of, real property that is the subject of a pending forfeiture action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The filing of a lis pendens and the execution of a writ of entry for the purpose of conducting an inspection and inventory of the property shall not be considered a seizure under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Government shall initiate a civil forfeiture action against real property by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) filing a complaint for forfeiture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) posting a notice of the complaint on the property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) serving notice on the property owner, along with a copy of the complaint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the property owner cannot be served with the notice under paragraph (1) because the owner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is a fugitive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) resides outside the United States and efforts at service pursuant to rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are unavailing; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) cannot be located despite the exercise of due diligence,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">constructive service may be made in accordance with the laws of the State in which the property is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If real property has been posted in accordance with this subsection, it shall not be necessary for the court to issue an arrest warrant in rem, or to take any other action to establish in rem jurisdiction over the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Real property may be seized prior to the entry of an order of forfeiture if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Government notifies the court that it intends to seize the property before trial; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the court&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) issues a notice of application for warrant, causes the notice to be served on the property owner and posted on the property, and conducts a hearing in which the property owner has a meaningful opportunity to be heard; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) makes an ex parte determination that there is probable cause for the forfeiture and that there are exigent circumstances that permit the Government to seize the property without prior notice and an opportunity for the property owner to be heard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), to establish exigent circumstances, the Government shall show that less restrictive measures such as a lis pendens, restraining order, or bond would not suffice to protect the Government's interests in preventing the sale, destruction, or continued unlawful use of the real property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the court authorizes a seizure of real property under subsection (d)(1)(B)(ii), it shall conduct a prompt post-seizure hearing during which the property owner shall have an opportunity to contest the basis for the seizure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) applies only to civil forfeitures of real property and interests in real property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) does not apply to forfeitures of the proceeds of the sale of such property or interests, or of money or other assets intended to be used to acquire such property or interests; and</p>
