<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;82, 87, 100, 101 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;&sect;35, 36, 47, 48, 35 Stat. 1095, 1096&ndash;1098; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197; Nov. 22, 1943, ch. 302, 57 Stat. 591.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 82, 87, 100, and 101 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Changes necessary to effect the consolidation were made. Words &ldquo;or shall willfully injure or commit any depredation against&rdquo; were taken from said section 82 so as to confine it to embezzlement or theft.</p>
<p class="note-body">The quoted language, rephrased in the present tense, appears in section 1361 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;in a jail&rdquo; which followed &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; and preceded &ldquo;for not more than one year&rdquo; in said section 82, were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Language relating to receiving stolen property is from said section 101.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or aid in concealing&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 2 of this title. Procedural language at end of said section 101 &ldquo;and such person may be tried either before or after the conviction of the principal offender&rdquo; was transferred to and rephrased in section 3435 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder&rdquo; in said section 82 were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions for fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than 1 year for an offense involving $100 or less and for fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than 10 years, or both, for <!-- PDFPage:131 -->an offense involving a greater amount were written into this section as more in conformity with the later congressional policy expressed in sections 82 and 87 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., than the nongraduated penalties of sections 100 and 101 of said title 18.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the purchasing power of the dollar is less than it was when $50 was the figure which determined whether larceny was petit larceny or grand larceny, the sum $100 was substituted as more consistent with modern values.</p>
<p class="note-body">The meaning of &ldquo;value&rdquo; in the last paragraph of the revised section is written to conform with that provided in section 2311 of this title by inserting the words &ldquo;face, par, or&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section incorporates the recommendation of Paul W. Hyatt, president, board of commissioners of the Idaho State Bar Association, that sections 82 and 100 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., be combined and simplified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, with respect to section 101 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., this section meets the suggestion of P. F. Herrick, United States attorney for Puerto Rico, that the punishment provision of said section be amended to make the offense a misdemeanor where the amount involved is $50 or less.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
