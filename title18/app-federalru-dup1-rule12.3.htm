<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Response to the Notice.</em></strong> An attorney for the government must serve a written response on the defendant or the defendant's attorney within 10 days after receiving the defendant's notice, but no later than 20 days before trial. The response must admit or deny that the defendant exercised the public authority identified in the defendant's notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) <em>Disclosing Witnesses.</em></strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Government's Request</em>. An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant disclose the name, address, and telephone number of each witness the defendant intends to rely on to establish a public-authority defense. An attorney for <!-- PDFPage:70 -->the government may serve the request when the government serves its response to the defendant's notice under Rule 12.3(a)(3), or later, but must serve the request no later than 20 days before trial.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Continuing Duty to Disclose.</strong> Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to the other party the name, address, and telephone number of any additional witness if:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.3(a)(4) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Failure to Comply.</strong> If a party fails to comply with this rule, the court may exclude the testimony of any undisclosed witness regarding the public-authority defense. This rule does not limit the defendant's right to testify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Protective Procedures Unaffected.</strong> This rule does not limit the court's authority to issue appropriate protective orders or to order that any filings be under seal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Inadmissibility of Withdrawn Intention.</strong> Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under Rule 12.3(a), later withdrawn, is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention.</p>
