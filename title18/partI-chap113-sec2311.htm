<p class="note-body">The definitive provisions in each of said sections were separated therefrom and consolidated into this one section defining terms used in this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the definition of &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo;, words &ldquo;designed for running on land but not on rails&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;not designed for running on rails&rdquo; so as to conform with the ruling in the case of <em>McBoyle</em> v. <em>U.S</em>. (1931, 51 S. Ct. 340, 283, U. S. 25, 75 L. Ed. 816), in which the Supreme Court held that &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; is limited to vehicles running on land and that motor vehicle does not include an airplane.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the paragraph defining &ldquo;value&rdquo; which came from said section 417 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., words &ldquo;In the event that a defendant is charged in the same indictment with two or more violations of sections 413&ndash;419 of this title, then&rdquo; were omitted and the same meaning was preserved by the substitution of the words &ldquo;a single&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;such.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
