<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 241, 244, 244a, 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (R.S. 2139; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, &sect;1, 19 Stat. 244; July 23, 1892, ch. 234, 27 Stat. 260; May 25, 1918, ch. 86, &sect;1, 40 Stat. 563; June 30, 1919, ch. 4, &sect;1, 41 Stat. 4; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396; June 27, 1934, ch. 846, 48 Stat. 1245; June 15, 1938, ch. 435, &sect;1, 52 Stat. 696).</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision of section 244 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, conforms with the effect thereon of sections 241, 244a, and 254 of said title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions relating to scope of term &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; in section 1151 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative and provision for commitment for nonpayment of fine was deleted. Such change was also recommended by United States District Judge T. Blake Kennedy. (See reviser's note under section 1154 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
