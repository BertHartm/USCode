<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 248 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (June 20, 1936, ch. 635, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 49 Stat. 1557).</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; of the United States was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in section 5 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words of punishment &ldquo;$250&rdquo; and &ldquo;six months&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;$500&rdquo; and &ldquo;one year&rdquo; respectively, as more consonant with penalties for similar offenses in this chapter. (See sections 701, 704, 705 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Punishment provision was also changed to omit reference to &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; in view of definitive section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;upon conviction&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage, because punishment can only be imposed after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
