<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 100 of title 31, Money and Finance, section 130 of title 38, Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans&rsquo; Relief, and section 841 of title 43, Public Lands, all U.S.C., 1940 ed. (May 21, 1872, ch. 178, 17 Stat. 137).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; were deleted as unnecessary. (See definition of &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; in section 1 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and shall upon conviction, be&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage since punishment can follow only after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">To clarify meaning of &ldquo;executive department&rdquo; word &ldquo;executive&rdquo; before &ldquo;department&rdquo; was deleted and words &ldquo;or agency&rdquo; were inserted after it. (See definitions of &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;bounty&rdquo;, before &ldquo;pension&rdquo;, and &ldquo;or land warrant&rdquo;, before &ldquo;of any such soldier&rdquo;, were deleted as obsolete. According to regulations, Circular 1151, January 8, 1929, issued by the Secretary of the Interior and the General Land Office (see 43 CFR 131.1&ndash;131.2) &ldquo;warrants for bounty lands were and are issued by the Commissioner of Pensions (Administrator of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs) for services in wars or battles prior to March 3, 1855 only.&rdquo; Further, it is stated that &ldquo;Warrants can not now be &lsquo;located&rsquo; upon the public lands. The locating privilege was denied except in the state of Missouri after the passage of the act of March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. 854; 43 U.S.C. &sect;700), and there are no lands known to the Gen<!-- PDFPage:91 -->eral Land Office to be subject to warrant location in Missouri.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and honorably discharged&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary and words &ldquo;or for his dependents or beneficiaries&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;United States&rdquo; so as to embrace an important class of persons who employ attorneys or agents in the collection of claims permitted by statute.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes of phraseology were also made.</p>
