<p class="note-body">Based on section 4 of title 36, Patriotic Societies and Observances (Jan. 5, 1905, ch. 23, &sect;4, 33 Stat. 600; June 23, 1910, ch. 372, &sect;1, 36 Stat. 604).</p>
<p class="note-body">False personation provision in first part of section was omitted here and incorporated in section 917 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words of punishment &ldquo;$250&rdquo; and &ldquo;six months&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;$500&rdquo; and &ldquo;one year&rdquo; respectively as more consonant with penalties provided for similar offenses in this chapter. (See sections 701, 704, 705 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Punishment provisions were also changed to omit reference to &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; in view of definitive section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage, because punishment can only be imposed after conviction.</p>
