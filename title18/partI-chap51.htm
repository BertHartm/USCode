<p class="note-body">Section consolidates the punishment provision of sections 454 and 567 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 452 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of said section 454 for the death penalty for first degree murder was consolidated with section 567 of said title 18, by adding the words &ldquo;unless the jury qualifies its verdict by adding thereto &lsquo;without capital punishment&rsquo; in which event he shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment for second degree murder was changed and the phrase &ldquo;for any term of years or for life&rdquo; was substituted for the words &ldquo;not less than ten years and may be imprisoned for life&rdquo;. This change conforms to a uniform policy of omitting the minimum punishment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 567 was not included in section 2031 of this title since the rewritten punishment provision for rape removes the necessity for a qualified verdict.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;253 (May 18, 1934, ch. 299, &sect;1, 48 Stat. 780; Feb. 8, 1936, ch. 40, 49 Stat. 1105; June 26, 1936, ch. 830, title I, &sect;3, 49 Stat. 1940; Reorg. Plan No. II, &sect;4(f), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433; June 13, 1940, ch. 359, 54 Stat. 391).</p>
<p class="note-body">The section was extended to include United States judges, attorneys and their assistants, and officers of Federal, penal and correctional institutions in view of the obvious desirability of such protective legislation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry have been included in this section to complete the revision of section 118 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was consolidated with the assault provisions of section 254 of said title 18 and is now section 111 of this title. There seemed no sound reason for including such officers in the protection against assaults but excluding them from the homicide sections.</p>
<p class="note-body">For like reasons the section was broadened to include officers or employees of the Secret Service or of the Bureau of Narcotics.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in phraseology were made.</p>
