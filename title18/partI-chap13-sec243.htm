<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 44 of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality (Mar. 1, 1875, ch. 114, &sect;4, 18 Stat. 336).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and&rdquo; were deleted as unnecessary in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;on conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment follows only after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minimum punishment provisions were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 203 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in phraseology were made.</p>
