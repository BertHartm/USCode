<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 1593 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties (June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, &sect;593, 46 Stat. 751).</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference in first paragraph to aiders, contained in words &ldquo;his, her, or their aiders and abettors&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary since such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title. For the same reason words &ldquo;or assists in so doing&rdquo; in second paragraph were deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,&rdquo; in first paragraph were omitted in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Conviction provision in first paragraph reading &ldquo;and on conviction thereof&rdquo; was deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minimum punishment provision &ldquo;nor less than $50&rdquo; in second paragraph was deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Forfeiture provision was rephrased to make it clear that forfeiture was not dependent upon conviction.</p>

<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
