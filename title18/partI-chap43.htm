<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 76 and 123 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The effect of this consolidation was to increase the punishment for revenue officers from $500 to $1,000 and from 2 years to 3 years, and to rephrase in the alternative the mandatory punishment provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section now applies the same punishment to all officers and agents of the United States found guilty of false personation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;agency or&rdquo; were inserted to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive section 6 of this title.) Other words referring to &ldquo;authority of any corporation owned or controlled by the United States&rdquo; were omitted for the same reason. (See <em>Pierce v. U.S</em>., 1941, 62 S. Ct. 237, 314 U.S. 306, 86 L. Ed. 226.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;with the intent to defraud the United States or any person&rdquo;, contained in said section 76 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as meaningless in view of <em>United States v. Lapowich</em>, 63 S. Ct. 914.</p>
