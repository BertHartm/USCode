<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule is a restatement of existing law and practice. It does not embody any regulation of sealed verdicts, it being contemplated that this matter would be governed by local practice in the various district courts. The rule does not affect the existing statutes relating to qualified verdicts in cases in which capital punishment may be imposed, 18 U.S.C. 408a [now 1201] (Kidnapped persons); sec. 412a [now 1992] (Wrecking trains); sec. 567 [now 1111] (Verdicts; qualified verdicts).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 566 (Verdicts; several joint defendants).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). This rule is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 565 (Verdicts; less offense than charged).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This rule is a restatement of existing law and practice, <em>Mackett v. United States</em>, 90 F.2d 462, 465 (C.C.A. 7th); <em>Bruce v. Chestnut Farms Chevy Chase Dairy</em>, 126 F.2d 224, App.D.C.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) is new. It is intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title IX, &sect;1963, and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II, &sect;408(a)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The assumption of the draft is that the amount of the interest or property subject to criminal forfeiture is an element of the offense to be alleged and proved. See Advisory Committee Note to rule 7(c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although special verdict provisions are rare in criminal cases, they are not unknown. See <em>United States v. Spock</em>, 416 F. 2d 165 (1st Cir. 1969), especially footnote 41 where authorities are listed.</p>
