<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 255 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (R.S. &sect;4062).</p>
<p class="note-body">Punishment provision was rewritten to make it more definite by substituting a maximum of $5,000 in lieu of the words &ldquo;fined at the discretion of the court.&rdquo; As thus revised this provision conforms with the first punishment provision of section 111 of this title. So, also, the greater punishment provided by the second paragraph of section 111 was added to this section for offenses involving the use of dangerous weapons.</p>
