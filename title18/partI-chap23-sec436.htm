<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;708, 709 (Feb. 23, 1887, ch. 213, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 24 Stat. 411).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates sections 708 and 709 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as the offense and penalty provisions, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;department or agency thereof&rdquo; were inserted to clarify scope of section. See definition of department and agency in section 6 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">To retain uniformity words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and,&rdquo; were omitted. The reference to <!-- PDFPage:92 -->misdemeanor is now covered by the definition in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;on conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary since punishment can follow only upon conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">The minimum punishment provisions &ldquo;less than one year nor&rdquo; and &ldquo;less than $500 nor&rdquo; were deleted to conform to the policy followed by codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code. (See reviser's note under section 203 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were also made in phraseology.</p>
