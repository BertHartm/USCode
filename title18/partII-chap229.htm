<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fine imposed pursuant to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 227 is a lien in favor of the United States upon all property belonging to the person fined. The lien arises at the time of the entry of the judgment and continues until the liability is satisfied, remitted, or set aside, or until it becomes unenforceable pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b). On application of the person fined, the Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) issue a certificate of release, as described in section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any lien imposed pursuant to this section, upon his acceptance of a bond described in section 6325(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) issue a certificate of discharge, as described in section 6325 of the Internal Revenue Code, of any part of the person's property subject to a lien imposed pursuant to this section, upon his determination that the fair market value of that part of such property remaining subject to and available to satisfy the lien is at least three times the amount of the fine.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Expiration of Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A lien becomes unenforceable and liability to pay a fine expires&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) twenty years after the entry of the judgment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon the death of the individual fined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The period set forth in paragraph (1) may be extended, prior to its expiration, by a written agreement between the person fined and the Attorney General. The running of the period set forth in paragraph (1) is suspended during any interval for which the running of the period of limitations for collection of a tax would be suspended pursuant to section 6503(b), 6503(c), 6503(f), 6503(i), or 7508(a)(1)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6503(b), 6503(c), 6503(f), 6503(i), or 7508(a)(1)(I)), or section 513 of the Act of October 17, 1940, 54 Stat. 1190.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Application of Other Lien Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The provisions of sections 6323, 6331, 6332, 6334 through 6336, 6337(a), 6338 through 6343, 6901, 7402, 7403, 7424 through 7426, 7505(a), 7506, 7701, and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6323, 6331, 6332, 6334 through 6336, 6337(a), 6338 through 6343, 6901, 7402, 7403, 7424 through 7426, 7505(a), 7506, 7701, and 7805) and of section 513 of the Act of October 17, 1940, 54 Stat. 1190, apply to a fine and to the lien imposed by subsection (a) as if the liability of the person fined were for an internal revenue tax assessment, except to the extent that the application of such statutes is modified by regulations issued by the Attorney General to accord with differences in the nature of the liabilities. For the purposes of this subsection, references in the preceding sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to &ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo; shall be construed to mean &ldquo;the Attor<!-- PDFPage:593 -->ney General,&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3613_1_target" name="3613_1">1</a></sup> and references in those sections to &ldquo;tax&rdquo; shall be construed to mean &ldquo;fine&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Notice of Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A notice of the lien imposed by subsection (a) shall be considered a notice of lien for taxes payable to the United States for the purposes of any State or local law providing for the filing of a notice of a tax lien. The registration, recording, docketing, or indexing, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1962, of the judgment under which a fine is imposed shall be considered for all purposes as the filing prescribed by section 6323(f)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6323(f)(1)(A)) and by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a judgment imposing a fine may be enforced by execution against the property of the person fined in like manner as judgments in civil cases, but in no event shall liability for payment of a fine extend beyond the period specified in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Discharge of Debts Inapplicable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No discharge of debts pursuant to a bankruptcy proceeding shall render a lien under this section unenforceable or discharge liability to pay a fine.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Place of Imprisonment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Bureau of Prisons shall designate the place of the prisoner's imprisonment.

<p class="note-body">The development of the occupational and educational skills of prison inmates is essential to their rehabilitation and to their ability to make an effective return to free society. Meaningful employment serves to develop those skills. It is also true, however, that care must be exercised to avoid either the exploitation of convict labor or any unfair competition between convict labor and free labor in the production of goods and services.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under sections 3621 and 3622 of title 18, United States Code, the Bureau of Prisons is empowered to authorize Federal prisoners to work at paid employment in the community during their terms of imprisonment under conditions that protect against both the exploitation of convict labor and unfair competition with free labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several states and other jurisdictions have similar laws or regulations under which individuals confined <!-- PDFPage:596 -->for violations of the laws of those places may be authorized to work at paid employment in the community.</p>
<p class="note-body">Executive Order No. 325A, which was originally issued by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, prohibits the employment, in the performance of Federal contracts, of any person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor imposed by a court of a State, territory, or municipality.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have now determined that Executive Order No. 325A should be replaced with a new Executive Order which would permit the employment of non-Federal prison inmates in the performance of Federal contracts under terms and conditions that are comparable to those now applicable to inmates of Federal prisons.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1.

This limitation, however, shall not prohibit the employment by a contractor in the performance of such contracts of persons on parole or probation to work at paid employment during the term of their sentence or persons who have been pardoned or who have served their terms. Nor shall it prohibit the employment by a contractor in the performance of such contracts of persons confined for violation of the laws of any of the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands who are authorized to work at paid employment in the community under the laws of such jurisdiction, if</p>

<p class="note-body">(B) Representatives of local union central bodies or similar labor union organizations have been consulted;</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) Such paid employment will not result in the displacement of employed workers, or be applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available gainful labor in the locality, or impair existing contracts for services; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(D) The rates of pay and other conditions of employment will not be less than those paid or provided for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is being performed; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3624. Release of a prisoner</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Date of Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, less any time credited toward the service of the prisoner's sentence as provided in subsection (b). If the date for a prisoner's release falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday at the place of confinement, the prisoner may be released by the Bureau on the last preceding weekday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Credit Toward Service of Sentence for Satisfactory Behavior</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A prisoner (other than a prisoner serving a sentence for a crime of violence) who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than one year, other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner's life, shall receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence, beyond the time served, of fifty-four days at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, beginning at the end of the first year of the term, unless the Bureau of Prisons determines that, during that year, the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional disciplinary regulations as have been approved by the Attorney General and issued to the prisoner. A prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year for a crime of violence, other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the <!-- PDFPage:597 -->prisoner's life, may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence, beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, beginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with such institutional disciplinary regulations. If the Bureau determines that, during that year, the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations, the prisoner shall receive no such credit toward service of the prisoner's sentence or shall receive such lesser credit as the Bureau determines to be appropriate. The Bureau's determination shall be made within fifteen days after the end of each year of the sentence. Credit that has not been earned may not later be granted. Credit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Credit toward a prisoner's service of sentence shall not be vested unless the prisoner has earned or is making satisfactory progress toward a high school diploma or an equivalent degree.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons has in effect an optional General Educational Development program for inmates who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Exemptions to the General Educational Development requirement may be made as deemed appropriate by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Pre-Release Custody</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Bureau of Prisons shall, to the extent practicable, assure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part, not to exceed six months, of the last 10 per centum of the term to be served under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for the prisoner's re-entry into the community. The authority provided by this subsection may be used to place a prisoner in home confinement. The United States Probation System shall, to the extent practicable, offer assistance to a prisoner during such pre-release custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Allotment of Clothing, Funds, and Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, the Bureau of Prisons shall furnish the prisoner with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) suitable clothing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount of money, not more than $500, determined by the Director to be consistent with the needs of the offender and the public interest, unless the Director determines that the financial position of the offender is such that no sum should be furnished; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) transportation to the place of the prisoner's conviction, to the prisoner's bona fide residence within the United States, or to such other place within the United States as may be authorized by the Director.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Supervision After Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prisoner whose sentence includes a term of supervised release after imprisonment shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation officer who shall, during the term imposed, supervise the person released to the degree warranted by the conditions specified by the sentencing court. The term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with any Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release. A term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days. No prisoner shall be released on supervision unless such prisoner agrees to adhere to an installment schedule, not to exceed two years except in special circumstances, to pay for any fine imposed for the offense committed by such prisoner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory Functional Literacy Requirement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Attorney General shall direct the Bureau of Prisons to have in effect a mandatory functional literacy program for all mentally capable inmates who are not functionally literate in each Federal correctional institution within 6 months from the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Each mandatory functional literacy program shall include a requirement that each inmate participate in such program for a mandatory period sufficient to provide the inmate with an adequate opportunity to achieve functional literacy, and appropriate incentives which lead to successful completion of such programs shall be developed and implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) As used in this section, the term &ldquo;functional literacy&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an eighth grade equivalence in reading and mathematics on a nationally recognized standardized test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) functional competency or literacy on a nationally recognized criterion-referenced test; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a combination of subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Non-English speaking inmates shall be required to participate in an English-As-A-Second-Language program until they function at the equivalence of the eighth grade on a nationally recognized educational achievement test.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Chief Executive Officer of each institution shall have authority to grant waivers for good cause as determined and documented on an individual basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A report shall be provided to Congress on an annual basis summarizing the results of this program, including the number of inmate participants, the number successfully completing the program, the number who do not successfully complete the program, and the reasons for failure to successfully complete the program.</p>
