<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States may enforce a judgment imposing a fine in accordance with the practices and procedures for the enforcement of a civil judgment under Federal law or State law. Notwithstanding any other Federal law (including section 207 of the Social Security Act), a judgment imposing a fine may be enforced against all property or rights to property of the person fined, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) property exempt from levy for taxes pursuant to section 6334(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (10), and (12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be exempt from enforcement of the judgment under Federal law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 3014 of chapter 176 of title 28 shall not apply to enforcement under Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the provisions of section 303 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673) shall apply to enforcement of the judgment under Federal law or State law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Liability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The liability to pay a fine shall terminate the later of 20 years from the entry of judgment or 20 years after the release from imprisonment of the person fined, or upon the death of the individual fined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fine imposed pursuant to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 227 of this title, or an order of restitution made pursuant to sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3613_1_target" name="3613_1">1</a></sup> 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, 3663A, or 3664 of this title, is a lien in favor of the United States on all property and rights to property of the person fined as if the liability of the person fined were a liability for a tax assessed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The lien arises on the entry of judgment and continues for 20 years or until the liability is satisfied, remitted, set aside, or is terminated under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Filing Notice of Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon filing of a notice of lien in the manner in which a notice of tax lien would be filed under section 6323(f)(1) and (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the lien shall be valid against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor or judgment lien creditor, except with respect to properties or transactions specified in subsection (b), (c), or (d) of section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for which a notice of tax lien properly filed on the same date would not be valid. The notice of lien shall be considered a notice of lien for taxes payable to the United States for the purpose of any State or local law providing for the filing of a notice of a tax lien. A notice of lien that is registered, recorded, docketed, or indexed in accordance with the rules and requirements relating to judgments of the courts of the State where the notice of lien is registered, recorded, docketed, or indexed shall be considered for all purposes as the filing prescribed by this section. The provisions of section 3201(e) of chapter 176 of title 28 shall apply to liens filed as prescribed by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Discharge of Debt Inapplicable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No discharge of debts in a proceeding pursuant to any chapter of title 11, United States Code, shall discharge liability to pay a fine pursuant to this section, and a lien filed as prescribed by this section shall not be voided in a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Applicability to Order of Restitution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In accordance with section 3664(m)(1)(A) of this title, all provisions of this section are available to the United States for the enforcement of an order of restitution.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 11755. Prison Labor</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 11755, Dec. 29, 1973, 39 F.R. 779, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 12608, Sept. 9, 1987, 52 F.R. 34617; Ex. Ord. No. 12943, Dec. 13, 1994, 59 F.R. 64553, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The development of the occupational and educational skills of prison inmates is essential to their rehabilitation and to their ability to make an effective return to free society. Meaningful employment serves to develop those skills. It is also true, however, that care must be exercised to avoid either the exploitation of convict labor or any unfair competition between convict labor and free labor in the production of goods and services.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under sections 3621 and 3622 of title 18, United States Code, the Bureau of Prisons is empowered to authorize Federal prisoners to work at paid employment in the community during their terms of imprisonment under conditions that protect against both the exploitation of convict labor and unfair competition with free labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several states and other jurisdictions have similar laws or regulations under which individuals confined for violations of the laws of those places may be authorized to work at paid employment in the community.</p>
<p class="note-body">Executive Order No. 325A, which was originally issued by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, prohibits the employment, in the performance of Federal contracts, of any person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor imposed by a court of a State, territory, or municipality.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have now determined that Executive Order No. 325A should be replaced with a new Executive Order which would permit the employment of non-Federal prison inmates in the performance of Federal contracts under terms and conditions that are comparable to those now applicable to inmates of Federal prisons.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. (a) All contracts involving the use of appropriated funds which shall hereafter be entered into by any department or agency of the executive branch for performance in any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands shall, unless otherwise provided by law, contain a stipulation forbidding in the performance of such contracts, the employment of persons undergoing sentences of imprisonment which have been imposed by any court of a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. This limitation, however, shall not prohibit the employment by a contractor in the performance of such contracts of persons on parole or probation to work at paid employment during the term of their sentence or persons who have been pardoned or who have served their terms. Nor shall it prohibit the employment by a contractor in the performance of such contracts of persons confined for violation of the laws of any of the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands who are authorized to work at paid employment in the community under the laws of such jurisdiction, if</p>
<p class="note-body">(1)(A) The worker is paid or is in an approved work training program on a voluntary basis;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) Representatives of local union central bodies or similar labor union organizations have been consulted;</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) Such paid employment will not result in the displacement of employed workers, or be applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available gainful labor in the locality, or impair existing contracts for services; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(D) The rates of pay and other conditions of employment will not be less than those paid or provided for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is being performed; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The Attorney General has certified that the work-release laws or regulations of the jurisdiction involved are in conformity with the requirements of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) After notice and opportunity for hearing, the Attorney General shall revoke any such certification under section 1(a)(2) if he finds that the work-release program of the jurisdiction involved is not being conducted in conformity with the requirements of this order or with its intent or purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The provisions of this order do not apply to purchases made under the micropurchase authority contained in section 32 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended [41 U.S.C. 428].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Federal Procurement Regulations, the Armed Services Procurement Regulations, and to the extent necessary, any supplemental or comparable regulations issued by any agency of the executive branch shall be revised to reflect the policy prescribed by this order.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3624. Release of a prisoner</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Date of Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, less any time credited toward the service of the prisoner's sentence as provided in subsection (b). If the date for a prisoner's release falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday at the place of confinement, the prisoner may be released by the Bureau on the last preceding weekday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Credit Toward Service of Sentence for Satisfactory Behavior</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3624_1_target" name="3624_1">1</a></sup> other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner's life, may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence, beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, beginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations. Subject to paragraph (2), if the Bureau determines that, during that year, the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations, the prisoner shall receive no such credit toward service of the prisoner's sentence or shall receive such lesser credit as the Bureau determines to be appropriate. In awarding credit under this section, the Bureau shall consider whether the prisoner, during the relevant period, has earned, or is making satisfactory progress toward earning, a high school diploma or an equivalent degree. Credit that has not been earned may not later be granted. Subject to paragraph (2), credit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other law, credit awarded under this subsection after the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act shall vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons has in effect an optional General Educational Development program for inmates who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Exemptions to the General Educational Development requirement may be made as deemed appropriate by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Pre-Release Custody</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Bureau of Prisons shall, to the extent practicable, assure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part, not to exceed six months, of the last 10 per centum of the term to be served under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for the prisoner's re-entry into the community. The authority provided by this subsection may be used to place a prisoner in home confinement. The United States Probation System shall, to the extent practicable, offer assistance to a prisoner during such pre-release custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Allotment of Clothing, Funds, and Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, the Bureau of Prisons shall furnish the prisoner with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) suitable clothing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount of money, not more than $500, determined by the Director to be consistent with the needs of the offender and the public interest, unless the Director determines that the financial position of the offender is such that no sum should be furnished; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) transportation to the place of the prisoner's conviction, to the prisoner's bona fide residence within the United States, or to such other place within the United States as may be authorized by the Director.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Supervision After Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prisoner whose sentence includes a term of supervised release after imprisonment shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation officer who shall, during the term imposed, supervise the person released to the degree warranted by the conditions specified by the sentencing court. The term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with any Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised <!-- PDFPage:733 -->release. A term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days. Upon the release of a prisoner by the Bureau of Prisons to supervised release, the Bureau of Prisons shall notify such prisoner, verbally and in writing, of the requirement that the prisoner adhere to an installment schedule, not to exceed 2 years except in special circumstances, to pay for any fine imposed for the offense committed by such prisoner, and of the consequences of failure to pay such fines under sections 3611 through 3614 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory Functional Literacy Requirement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Attorney General shall direct the Bureau of Prisons to have in effect a mandatory functional literacy program for all mentally capable inmates who are not functionally literate in each Federal correctional institution within 6 months from the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Each mandatory functional literacy program shall include a requirement that each inmate participate in such program for a mandatory period sufficient to provide the inmate with an adequate opportunity to achieve functional literacy, and appropriate incentives which lead to successful completion of such programs shall be developed and implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) As used in this section, the term &ldquo;functional literacy&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an eighth grade equivalence in reading and mathematics on a nationally recognized standardized test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) functional competency or literacy on a nationally recognized criterion-referenced test; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a combination of subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Non-English speaking inmates shall be required to participate in an English-As-A-Second-Language program until they function at the equivalence of the eighth grade on a nationally recognized educational achievement test.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Chief Executive Officer of each institution shall have authority to grant waivers for good cause as determined and documented on an individual basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Relief.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Prospective relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The court shall not order any prospective relief that requires or permits a government official to exceed his or her authority under State or local law or otherwise violates State or local law, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in violation of State or local law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the Federal right.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the courts, in exercising their remedial powers, to order the construction of prisons or the raising of taxes, or to repeal or detract from otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of the courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Preliminary injunctive relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief. Preliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief and shall respect the principles of comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) in tailoring any preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Prisoner release order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, no court shall enter a prisoner release order unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a court has previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right <!-- PDFPage:735 -->sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In any civil action in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by a three-judge court in accordance with section 2284 of title 28, if the requirements of subparagraph (E) have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A party seeking a prisoner release order in Federal court shall file with any request for such relief, a request for a three-judge court and materials sufficient to demonstrate that the requirements of subparagraph (A) have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) have been met, a Federal judge before whom a civil action with respect to prison conditions is pending who believes that a prison release order should be considered may sua sponte request the convening of a three-judge court to determine whether a prisoner release order should be entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The three-judge court shall enter a prisoner release order only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Any State or local official including a legislator or unit of government whose jurisdiction or function includes the appropriation of funds for the construction, operation, or maintenance of prison facilities, or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be released from, or not admitted to, a prison as a result of a prisoner release order shall have standing to oppose the imposition or continuation in effect of such relief and to seek termination of such relief, and shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding relating to such relief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Relief.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Termination of prospective relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which prospective relief is ordered, such relief shall be terminable upon the motion of any party or intervener&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 2 years after the date the court granted or approved the prospective relief;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 1 year after the date the court has entered an order denying termination of prospective relief under this paragraph; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of an order issued on or before the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 2 years after such date of enactment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall prevent the parties from agreeing to terminate or modify relief before the relief is terminated under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Immediate termination of prospective relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or intervener shall be entitled to the immediate termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Termination or modification of relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall prevent any party or intervener from seeking modification or termination before the relief is terminable under paragraph (1) or (2), to the extent that modification or termination would otherwise be legally permissible.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Settlements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Consent decrees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, the court shall not enter or approve a consent decree unless it complies with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Private settlement agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Nothing in this section shall preclude parties from entering into a private settlement agreement that does not comply with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a), if the terms of that agreement are not subject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall preclude any party claiming that a private settlement agreement has been breached from seeking in State court any remedy available under State law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Law Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The limitations on remedies in this section shall not apply to relief entered by a State court based solely upon claims arising under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Procedure for Motions Affecting Prospective Relief.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Generally</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall promptly rule on any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions. Mandamus shall lie to remedy any failure to issue a prompt ruling on such a motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Automatic stay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief made under subsection (b) shall operate as a stay during the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) beginning on the 30th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) beginning on the 180th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under any other law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ending on the date the court enters a final order ruling on the motion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Postponement of automatic stay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may postpone the effective date of an automatic stay specified in subsection <!-- PDFPage:736 -->(e)(2)(A) for not more than 60 days for good cause. No postponement shall be permissible because of general congestion of the court's calendar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Order blocking the automatic stay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any order staying, suspending, delaying, or barring the operation of the automatic stay described in paragraph (2) (other than an order to postpone the effective date of the automatic stay under paragraph (3)) shall be treated as an order refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction and shall be appealable pursuant to section 1292(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, regardless of how the order is styled or whether the order is termed a preliminary or a final ruling.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Special Masters.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) In any civil action in a Federal court with respect to prison conditions, the court may appoint a special master who shall be disinterested and objective and who will give due regard to the public safety, to conduct hearings on the record and prepare proposed findings of fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The court shall appoint a special master under this subsection during the remedial phase of the action only upon a finding that the remedial phase will be sufficiently complex to warrant the appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Appointment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) If the court determines that the appointment of a special master is necessary, the court shall request that the defendant institution and the plaintiff each submit a list of not more than 5 persons to serve as a special master.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Each party shall have the opportunity to remove up to 3 persons from the opposing party's list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The court shall select the master from the persons remaining on the list after the operation of subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Interlocutory appeal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any party shall have the right to an interlocutory appeal of the judge's selection of the special master under this subsection, on the ground of partiality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The compensation to be allowed to a special master under this section shall be based on an hourly rate not greater than the hourly rate established under section 3006A for payment of court-appointed counsel, plus costs reasonably incurred by the special master. Such compensation and costs shall be paid with funds appropriated to the Judiciary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Regular review of appointment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which a special master is appointed under this subsection, the court shall review the appointment of the special master every 6 months to determine whether the services of the special master continue to be required under paragraph (1). In no event shall the appointment of a special master extend beyond the termination of the relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on powers and duties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A special master appointed under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be authorized by a court to conduct hearings and prepare proposed findings of fact, which shall be made on the record;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall not make any findings or communications ex parte;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may be authorized by a court to assist in the development of remedial plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) may be removed at any time, but shall be relieved of the appointment upon the termination of relief.</p>
