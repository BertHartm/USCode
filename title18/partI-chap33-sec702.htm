<h4 class="note-head">1949 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section [section 15] inserts &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; in the catch line and text of section 702 of title 18, U.S.C., and thereby includes the Air Force which was formerly part of the Army. (See note to sec. 5 [of 1949 Act, set out in Legislative History note under section 244 of title 18]). Also, it incorporates in such section the provisions of act of April 15, 1948 (ch. 188, 62 Stat. 172), which relates to this section as well as to section 1393 of title 10, U.S.C. (one of the sources of such sec. 701), as it existed at the time of the enactment of the revision of title 18 and which was not incorporated in title 18 when the revision was enacted. In this connection specific reference to the Canal Zone, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands, as contained in such act of April 15, 1948, were omitted as covered by the phrase, &ldquo;in any place within the jurisdiction of the United States,&rdquo; as used in this amendment of such section 702 of title 18, U.S.C.</p>
