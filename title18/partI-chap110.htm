<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;358, title I, &sect;102, Oct. 8, 2008, 122 Stat. 4001, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Child pornography is estimated to be a multibillion dollar industry of global proportions, facilitated by the growth of the Internet.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Data has shown that 83 percent of child pornography possessors had images of children younger than 12 years old, 39 percent had images of children younger than 6 years old, and 19 percent had images of children younger than 3 years old.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Child pornography is a permanent record of a child's abuse and the distribution of child pornography images revictimizes the child each time the image is viewed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Child pornography is readily available through virtually every Internet technology, including Web sites, email, instant messaging, Internet Relay Chat, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and peer-to-peer.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The technological ease, lack of expense, and anonymity in obtaining and distributing child pornography over the Internet has resulted in an explosion in the multijurisdictional distribution of child pornography.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Internet is well recognized as a method of distributing goods and services across State lines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The transmission of child pornography using the Internet constitutes transportation in interstate commerce.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;248, title V, &sect;501, July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 623, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The effect of the intrastate production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography on the interstate market in child pornography:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) The illegal production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising and possession of child pornography, as defined in section 2256(8) of title 18, United States Code, as well as the transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the children depicted in child pornography and has a substantial and detrimental effect on society as a whole.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) A substantial interstate market in child pornography exists, including not only a multimillion dollar industry, but also a nationwide network of individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit children and to traffic in child pornography. Many of these individuals distribute child pornography with the expectation of receiving other child pornography in return.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) The interstate market in child pornography is carried on to a substantial extent through the mails and other instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, such as the Internet. The advent of the Internet has greatly increased the ease of transporting, distributing, receiving, and advertising child pornography in interstate commerce. The advent of digital cameras and digital video cameras, as well as videotape cameras, has greatly increased the ease of producing child pornography. The advent of inexpensive computer equipment with the capacity to store large numbers of digital images of child pornography has greatly increased the ease of possessing child pornography. Taken together, these technological advances have had the unfortunate result of greatly increasing the interstate market in child pornography.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Intrastate incidents of production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because:</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) Some persons engaged in the production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography conduct such activities entirely within the boundaries of one state. These persons are unlikely to be content with the amount of child pornography they produce, transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess. These persons are therefore likely to enter the interstate market in child pornography in search of additional child pornography, thereby stimulating demand in the interstate market in child pornography.</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) When the persons described in subparagraph (D)(i) enter the interstate market in search of additional child pornography, they are likely to distribute the child pornography they already produce, transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess to persons who will distribute additional child pornography to them, thereby stimulating supply in the interstate market in child pornography.</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) Much of the child pornography that supplies the interstate market in child pornography is produced entirely within the boundaries of one state, is not traceable, and enters the interstate market surreptitiously. This child pornography supports demand in the interstate market in child pornography and is essential to its existence.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Prohibiting the intrastate production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, will cause some persons engaged in such intrastate activities to cease all such activities, thereby reducing both supply and demand in the interstate market for child pornography.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of children for the production of child pornography, is essential to the effective control of the interstate market in child pornography.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The importance of protecting children from repeat exploitation in child pornography:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions today involve images contained on computer hard drives, computer disks, and related media.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Child pornography is not entitled to protection under the First Amendment and thus may be prohibited.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) The government has a compelling State interest in protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, and this interest extends to <!-- PDFPage:470 -->stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Every instance of viewing images of child pornography represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims and a repetition of their abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Child pornography constitutes prima facie contraband, and as such should not be distributed to, or copied by, child pornography defendants or their attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) It is imperative to prohibit the reproduction of child pornography in criminal cases so as to avoid repeated violation and abuse of victims, so long as the government makes reasonable accommodations for the inspection, viewing, and examination of such material for the purposes of mounting a criminal defense.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;21, title V, &sect;501, Apr. 30, 2003, 117 Stat. 676, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to protection under the First Amendment under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may be prohibited.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Government has a compelling state interest in protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, including both child molesters and child pornographers. &lsquo;The prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance,&rsquo; New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982), and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 (1990).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child pornography remain enforceable and effective. &lsquo;The most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.&rsquo; Ferber, 458 U.S. at 760.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the technology did not exist to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) computer generate depictions of children that are indistinguishable from depictions of real children;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) use parts of images of real children to create a composite image that is unidentifiable as a particular child and in a way that prevents even an expert from concluding that parts of images of real children were used; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) disguise pictures of real children being abused by making the image look computer-generated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and to make depictions of real children appear computer-generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not already, to computer generate realistic images of children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions today involve images contained on computer hard drives, computer disks, and/or related media.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child pornography images being trafficked today were made other than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless, technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography they possess are not those of real children, insisting that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the images are not computer-generated. Such challenges increased significantly after the decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers and has been transferred over the Internet, often in different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a paper version into a digital format, this task can be even harder since proper forensic assessment may depend on the quality of the image scanned and the tools used to scan it.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The impact of the Free Speech Coalition decision on the Government's ability to prosecute child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically identify the child in the depiction or otherwise identify the origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme Court's affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision, prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed concern about the continued viability of previously indicted cases as well as declined potentially meritorious prosecutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Since the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech Coalition, defendants in child pornography cases have almost universally raised the contention that the images in question could be virtual, thereby requiring the government, in nearly every child pornography prosecution, to find proof that the child is real. Some of these defense efforts have already been successful. In addition, the number of prosecutions being brought has been significantly and adversely affected as the resources required to be dedicated to each child pornography case now are significantly higher than ever before.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Leading experts agree that, to the extent that the technology exists to computer generate realistic images of child pornography, the cost in terms of time, money, and expertise is&mdash;and for the foreseeable future will remain&mdash;prohibitively expensive. As a result, for the foreseeable future, it will be more cost-effective to produce child pornography using real children. It will not, however, be difficult or expensive to use readily available technology to disguise those depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable or to make them appear computer-generated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Child pornography results from the abuse of real children by sex offenders; the production of child pornography is a byproduct of, and not the primary reason for, the sexual abuse of children. There is no evidence that the future development of easy and inexpensive means of computer generating realistic images of children would stop or even reduce the sexual abuse of real children or the practice of visually recording that abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) In the absence of congressional action, the difficulties in enforcing the child pornography laws will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere prospect that the technology exists to create composite or computer-generated depictions that are indistinguishable from depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess images of real children to escape prosecution; for it threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of computer images even when a real child was abused. This threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real children unenforceable. Moreover, imposing an additional requirement that the Government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the image was in fact a real child&mdash;as some courts have done&mdash;threatens to result in the de facto legalization of the possession, receipt, and distribution of child pornography for all except the original producers of the material.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:471 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) To avoid this grave threat to the Government's unquestioned compelling interest in effective enforcement of the child pornography laws that protect real children, a statute must be adopted that prohibits a narrowly-defined subcategory of images.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The Supreme Court's 1982 Ferber v. New York decision holding that child pornography was not protected drove child pornography off the shelves of adult bookstores. Congressional action is necessary now to ensure that open and notorious trafficking in such materials does not reappear, and even increase, on the Internet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 101(a) [title I, &sect;121[1]] of Pub. L. 104&ndash;208 provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the use of children in the production of sexually explicit material, including photographs, films, videos, computer images, and other visual depictions, is a form of sexual abuse which can result in physical or psychological harm, or both, to the children involved;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) where children are used in its production, child pornography permanently records the victim's abuse, and its continued existence causes the child victims of sexual abuse continuing harm by haunting those children in future years;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) child pornography is often used as part of a method of seducing other children into sexual activity; a child who is reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to pose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be convinced by viewing depictions of other children &lsquo;having fun&rsquo; participating in such activity;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) child pornography is often used by pedophiles and child sexual abusers to stimulate and whet their own sexual appetites, and as a model for sexual acting out with children; such use of child pornography can desensitize the viewer to the pathology of sexual abuse or exploitation of children, so that it can become acceptable to and even preferred by the viewer;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) new photographic and computer imagining [sic] technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or other means, visual depictions of what appear to be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) computers and computer imaging technology can be used to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) alter sexually explicit photographs, films, and videos in such a way as to make it virtually impossible for unsuspecting viewers to identify individuals, or to determine if the offending material was produced using children;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) produce visual depictions of child sexual activity designed to satisfy the preferences of individual child molesters, pedophiles, and pornography collectors; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) alter innocent pictures of children to create visual depictions of those children engaging in sexual conduct;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the creation or distribution of child pornography which includes an image of a recognizable minor invades the child's privacy and reputational interests, since images that are created showing a child's face or other identifiable feature on a body engaging in sexually explicit conduct can haunt the minor for years to come;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the effect of visual depictions of child sexual activity on a child molester or pedophile using that material to stimulate or whet his own sexual appetites, or on a child where the material is being used as a means of seducing or breaking down the child's inhibitions to sexual abuse or exploitation, is the same whether the child pornography consists of photographic depictions of actual children or visual depictions produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or other means, including by computer, which are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from photographic images of actual children;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the danger to children who are seduced and molested with the aid of child sex pictures is just as great when the child pornographer or child molester uses visual depictions of child sexual activity produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or other means, including by computer, as when the material consists of unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) the existence of and traffic in child pornographic images creates the potential for many types of harm in the community and presents a clear and present danger to all children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) it inflames the desires of child molesters, pedophiles, and child pornographers who prey on children, thereby increasing the creation and distribution of child pornography and the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children who are victimized as a result of the existence and use of these materials;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11)(A) the sexualization and eroticization of minors through any form of child pornographic images has a deleterious effect on all children by encouraging a societal perception of children as sexual objects and leading to further sexual abuse and exploitation of them; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) this sexualization of minors creates an unwholesome environment which affects the psychological, mental and emotional development of children and undermines the efforts of parents and families to encourage the sound mental, moral and emotional development of children;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) prohibiting the possession and viewing of child pornography will encourage the possessors of such material to rid themselves of or destroy the material, thereby helping to protect the victims of child pornography and to eliminate the market for the sexual exploitative use of children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) the elimination of child pornography and the protection of children from sexual exploitation provide a compelling governmental interest for prohibiting the production, distribution, possession, sale, or viewing of visual depictions of children engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including both photographic images of actual children engaging in such conduct and depictions produced by computer or other means which are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from photographic images of actual children engaging in such conduct.&rdquo;</p>
