<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;148, and on sections 264(x) and 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;12B, subsection (x), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, &sect;8, 48 Stat. 178; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;31, sixth paragraph, 39 Stat. 382 (384); Dec. 11, 1926, ch. 2, &sect;3, 44 Stat. 918; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;101, 49 Stat. 684, 703).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates said section 148 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and said sections 264(x) and 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 148 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was concerned with offenses relating to counterfeiting and passing, etc., of transportation requests and to the unlawful possession or making of plates, stones, etc., used in making such requests, which were defined in sections 146 and 147 of said title 18, now sections 508 and 509 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Said sections 264(x) and 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were concerned with various offenses as defined in sections 981&ndash;985, 987 of said title 12, relating to Federal land banks, joint-stock land banks and national farm loan associations, and as defined in section 264 of said title 12 relating to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. All of the provisions of said sections 981&ndash;985, 987 of said title 12, and the criminal provisions of said section 264 of said title 12, were transferred to this title where they were, in some instances, consolidated with similar provisions from other sections. Such provisions are now incorporated in sections 218, 221, 433, 493, 657, 709, 1006, 1007, 1011, 1013, 1014, 1907, and 1909 of this title. In most instances, these sections, as the result of the consolidations, relate to other organizations as well as those mentioned above, but, by enumerating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal land banks, joint-stock land banks, and national farm loan associations in this section, the powers of the Secret Service are not broadened beyond what they were in said sections 264(x) and 986 of said title 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this section, the wording of said section 148 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking reading &ldquo;The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to direct and use the Secret Service Division of the Treasury Department&rdquo; was adopted, rather than the wording of said section 264(x) of said title 12, which read &ldquo;The Secret Service Division of the Treasury Department is authorized.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;of the United States marshal having jurisdiction&rdquo;, following &ldquo;custody&rdquo; in all three of said sections, were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
