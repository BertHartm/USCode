<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3006A. Adequate representation of defendants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Choice of Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each United States district court, with the approval of the judicial council of the circuit, shall place in operation throughout the district a plan for furnishing representation for any person financially unable to obtain adequate representation in accordance with this section. Representation under each plan shall include counsel and investigative, expert, and other services necessary for adequate representation. Each plan shall provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Representation shall be provided for any financially eligible person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is charged with a felony or a Class A misdemeanor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is a juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency as defined in section 5031 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is charged with a violation of probation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) is under arrest, when such representation is required by law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) is charged with a violation of supervised release or faces modification, reduction, or enlargement of a condition, or extension or revocation of a term of supervised release;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) is subject to a mental condition hearing under chapter 313 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) is in custody as a material witness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) is entitled to appointment of counsel under the sixth amendment to the Constitution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) faces loss of liberty in a case, and Federal law requires the appointment of counsel; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) is entitled to the appointment of counsel under section 4109 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Whenever the United States magistrate judge or the court determines that the interests of justice so require, representation may be provided for any financially eligible person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is charged with a Class B or C misdemeanor, or an infraction for which a sentence to confinement is authorized; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is seeking relief under section 2241, 2254, or 2255 of title 28.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Private attorneys shall be appointed in a substantial proportion of the cases. Each plan may include, in addition to the provisions for private attorneys, either of the following or both:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Attorneys furnished by a bar association or a legal aid agency,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Attorneys furnished by a defender organization established in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Prior to approving the plan for a district, the judicial council of the circuit shall supplement the plan with provisions for representation on appeal. The district court may modify the plan at any time with the approval of the judicial council of the circuit. It shall modify the plan when directed by the judicial council of the circuit. The district court shall notify the Administrative Office of the United States Courts of any modification of its plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of Counsel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Counsel furnishing representation under the plan shall be selected from a panel of attorneys designated or approved by the court, or from a bar association, legal aid agency, or defender organization furnishing representation pursuant to the plan. In every case in which a person entitled to representation under a plan approved under subsection (a) appears without counsel, the United States magistrate judge or the court shall advise the person that he has the right to be rep<!-- PDFPage:548 -->resented by counsel and that counsel will be appointed to represent him if he is financially unable to obtain counsel. Unless the person waives representation by counsel, the United States magistrate judge or the court, if satisfied after appropriate inquiry that the person is financially unable to obtain counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent him. Such appointment may be made retroactive to include any representation furnished pursuant to the plan prior to appointment. The United States magistrate judge or the court shall appoint separate counsel for persons having interests that cannot properly be represented by the same counsel, or when other good cause is shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Duration and Substitution of Appointments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person for whom counsel is appointed shall be represented at every stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the United States magistrate judge or the court through appeal, including ancillary matters appropriate to the proceedings. If at any time after the appointment of counsel the United States magistrate judge or the court finds that the person is financially able to obtain counsel or to make partial payment for the representation, it may terminate the appointment of counsel or authorize payment as provided in subsection (f), as the interests of justice may dictate. If at any stage of the proceedings, including an appeal, the United States magistrate judge or the court finds that the person is financially unable to pay counsel whom he had retained, it may appoint counsel as provided in subsection (b) and authorize payment as provided in subsection (d), as the interests of justice may dictate. The United States magistrate judge or the court may, in the interests of justice, substitute one appointed counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Payment for Representation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>Hourly Rate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any attorney appointed pursuant to this section or a bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization which has provided the appointed attorney shall, at the conclusion of the representation or any segment thereof, be compensated at a rate not exceeding $60 per hour for time expended in court or before a United States magistrate judge and $40 per hour for time reasonably expended out of court, unless the Judicial Conference determines that a higher rate of not in excess of $75 per hour is justified for a circuit or for particular districts within a circuit, for time expended in court or before a United States magistrate judge and for time expended out of court. The Judicial Conference shall develop guidelines for determining the maximum hourly rates for each circuit in accordance with the preceding sentence, with variations by district, where appropriate, taking into account such factors as the minimum range of the prevailing hourly rates for qualified attorneys in the district in which the representation is provided and the recommendations of the judicial councils of the circuits. Not less than 3 years after the effective date of the Criminal Justice Act Revision of 1986, the Judicial Conference is authorized to raise the maximum hourly rates specified in this paragraph up to the aggregate of the overall average percentages of the adjustments in the rates of pay under the General Schedule made pursuant to section 5305&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3006A_1_target" name="3006A_1">1</a></sup> of title 5 on or after such effective date. After the rates are raised under the preceding sentence, such maximum hourly rates may be raised at intervals of not less than 1 year each, up to the aggregate of the overall average percentages of such adjustments made since the last raise was made under this paragraph. Attorneys may be reimbursed for expenses reasonably incurred, including the costs of transcripts authorized by the United States magistrate&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3006A_2_target" name="3006A_2">2</a></sup> or the court, and the costs of defending actions alleging malpractice of counsel in furnishing representational services under this section. No reimbursement for expenses in defending against malpractice claims shall be made if a judgment of malpractice is rendered against the counsel furnishing representational services under this section. The United States magistrate&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3006A_2_target" name="3006A_2">2</a></sup> or the court shall make determinations relating to reimbursement of expenses under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For representation of a defendant before the United States magistrate judge or the district court, or both, the compensation to be paid to an attorney or to a bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization shall not exceed $7,000 for each attorney in a case in which one or more felonies are charged, and $2,000 for each attorney in a case in which only misdemeanors are charged. For representation of a defendant in an appellate court, the compensation to be paid to an attorney or to a bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization shall not exceed $5,000 for each attorney in each court. For representation of a petitioner in a non-capital habeas corpus proceeding, the compensation for each attorney shall not exceed the amount applicable to a felony in this paragraph for representation of a defendant before a judicial officer of the district court. For representation of such petitioner in an appellate court, the compensation for each attorney shall not exceed the amount applicable for representation of a defendant in an appellate court. For representation of an offender before the United States Parole Commission in a proceeding under section 4106A of this title, the compensation shall not exceed $1,500 for each attorney in each proceeding; for representation of an offender in an appeal from a determination of such Commission under such section, the compensation shall not exceed $5,000 for each attorney in each court. For any other representation required or authorized by this section, the compensation shall not exceed $1,500 for each attorney in each proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Maximum Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Payment in excess of any maximum amount provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection may be made for extended or complex representation whenever the court in which the representation was rendered, or the United States magistrate judge if the representation was furnished exclusively before him, certifies that the amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide fair compensa<!-- PDFPage:549 -->tion and the payment is approved by the chief judge of the circuit. The chief judge of the circuit may delegate such approval authority to an active circuit judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of fees.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subparagraphs (B) through (E), the amounts paid under this subsection for services in any case shall be made available to the public by the court upon the court's approval of the payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Pre-trial or trial in progress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a trial is in pre-trial status or still in progress and after considering the defendant's interests as set forth in subparagraph (D), the court shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) redact any detailed information on the payment voucher provided by defense counsel to justify the expenses to the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) make public only the amounts approved for payment to defense counsel by dividing those amounts into the following categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) Arraignment and or plea.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) Bail and detention hearings.</p>
