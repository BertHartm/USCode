<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 708 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping (R.S. &sect;4606).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Law enforcement officer&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;constable or police officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;committing magistrate&rdquo; for &ldquo;justice of the peace.&rdquo; The phraseology used in the statute was archaic. It originated when the government had few law enforcement officers and magistrates of its own.</p>
<p class="note-body">References to specific sections were made to read: &ldquo;according to law&rdquo; to achieve brevity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;without permission of the master&rdquo; were deleted to remove an inconsistency with the provisions of section 163 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and customs regulations. Customs regulations, 1943, section 4.1c, prohibit any person &ldquo;with or without consent of the master&rdquo; from boarding vessel, with specific enumerated exceptions. Said section 163 prescribes a &ldquo;penalty of not more than $100 or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both&rdquo; for violating regulations. The revised section increases the fine from $100 to $200 for boarding the vessel &ldquo;with the consent of the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
