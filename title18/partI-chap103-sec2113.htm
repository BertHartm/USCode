<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 588a, 588b, 588c, of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (May 18, 1934, ch. 304, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 3, 48 Stat. 783; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;333, 49 Stat. 720; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 747, 50 Stat. 749; June 29, 1940, ch. 455, 54 Stat. 695).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 588a, 588b, and 588c of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, as suggested by United States Attorney Clyde O. Eastus, of Fort Worth, Tex.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;felony or larceny&rdquo; in subsection (a) were changed to &ldquo;felony affecting such bank and in violation of any statute of the United States, or any larceny&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Use of term &ldquo;felony&rdquo; without limitation caused confusion as to whether a common law, State, or Federal felony was intended. Change conforms with <em>Jerome v. U.S</em>. (1943, 63 S. Ct. 483, 318 U.S. 101, 87 L. Ed. 640): &ldquo;&sect;2(a) [&sect;588b(a) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking] is not deprived of vitality if it is interpreted to exclude State felonies and to include only those Federal felonies which affect banks protected by the Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Minimum punishment provisions were omitted from subsection (c). (See reviser's note under section 203 of this title.) Also the provisions of subsection (b) measuring the punishment by the amount involved were extended and made applicable to the receiver as well as the thief. There seems no good reason why the thief of less than $100 should be liable to a maximum of imprisonment for one year and the receiver subject to 10 years.</p>
<p class="note-body">The figures &ldquo;100&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;50&rdquo; in view of the fact that the present worth of $100 is less than the value of $50 when that sum was fixed as the dividing line between petit larceny and grand larceny.</p>
<p class="note-body">The attention of Congress is directed to the mandatory minimum punishment provisions of sections 2113(e) and 2114 of this title. These were left unchanged because of the controversial question involved. Such legislative attempts to control the discretion of the sentencing judge are contrary to the opinions of experienced criminologists and criminal law experts. They are calculated to work manifest injustice in many cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">Necessary minor translations of section references, and changes in phraseology, were made.</p>
