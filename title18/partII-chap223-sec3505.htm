<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the business activity made such a record as a regular practice; and</p>

A motion opposing admission in evidence of such record shall be made by the opposing party and determined by the court before trial. Failure by a party to file such motion before trial shall constitute a waiver of objection to such record or duplicate, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.</p>
