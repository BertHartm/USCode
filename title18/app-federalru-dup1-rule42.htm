<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Summary Disposition</cap-smallcap>. A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certifies that the judge saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Disposition Upon Notice and Hearing</cap-smallcap>. A criminal contempt except as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule shall be prosecuted on notice. The notice shall state the time and place of hearing, allowing a reasonable time for the preparation of the defense, and shall state the essential facts constituting the criminal contempt charged and describe it as such. The notice shall be given orally by the judge in open court in the presence of the defendant or, on application of the United States attorney or of an attorney appointed by the court for that purpose, by an order to show cause or an order of arrest. The defendant is entitled to a trial by jury in any case in which an act of Congress so provides. The defendant is entitled to admission to bail as provided in these rules. If the contempt charged involves disrespect to or criticism of a judge, that judge is disqualified from presiding at the trial or hearing except with the defendant's consent. Upon a verdict or finding of guilt the court shall enter an order fixing the punishment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule-making power of the Supreme Court with respect to criminal proceedings was extended to proceedings to punish for criminal contempt of court by the Act of November 21, 1941 (55 Stat. 779), 18 U.S.C. 689 [see 3771, 3772].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law, <em>Ex parte Terry</em>, 128 U.S. 289; <em>Cooke v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 517, 534.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). 1. This rule is substantially a restatement of the procedure prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 386&ndash;390 [now 18 U.S.C. 401, 402, 3285, 3691], and 29 U.S.C. 111 [now 18 U.S.C. 3692].</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The requirement in the second sentence that the notice shall describe the criminal contempt as such is intended to obviate the frequent confusion between criminal and civil contempt proceedings and follows the suggestion made in <em>McCann v. New York Stock Exchange</em>, 80 F.2d 211 (C.C.A. 2d). See also <em>Nye v. United States</em>, 313 U.S. 33, 42&ndash;43.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The fourth sentence relating to trial by jury preserves the right to a trial by jury in those contempt cases in which it is granted by statute, but does not enlarge the right or extend it to additional cases. The respondent in a contempt proceeding may demand a trial by jury as of right if the proceeding is brought under the Act of March 23, 1932, c. 90, sec. 11, 47 Stat. 72, 29 U.S.C. 111 [now 18 U.S.C. 3692] (Norris-La Guardia Act), or the Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, sec. 22, 38 Stat. 738, 28 U.S.C. 387 (Clayton Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The provision in the sixth sentence disqualifying the judge affected by the contempt if the charge involves disrespect to or criticism of him, is based, in part, on 29 U.S.C. former &sect;112 (Contempts; demand for retirement of judge sitting in proceeding) and the observations of Chief Justice Taft in <em>Cooke v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 517, 539, 45 S.Ct. 390, 69 L.Ed. 767.</p>
