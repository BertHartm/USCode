<h3 class="section-head">Rule 42. Criminal Contempt</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Disposition After Notice.</strong> Any person who commits criminal contempt may be punished for that contempt after prosecution on notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>Notice.</em></strong> The court must give the person notice in open court, in an order to show cause, or in an arrest order. The notice must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) state the time and place of the trial;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) allow the defendant a reasonable time to prepare a defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) state the essential facts constituting the charged criminal contempt and describe it as such.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Appointing a Prosecutor.</em></strong> The court must request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government, unless the interest of justice requires the appointment of another attorney. If the government declines the request, the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Trial and Disposition.</em></strong> A person being prosecuted for criminal contempt is entitled to a jury trial in any case in which federal law so provides and must be released or detained as Rule 46 provides. If the criminal contempt involves disrespect toward or criticism of a judge, that judge is disqualified from presiding at the contempt trial or hearing unless the defendant consents. Upon a finding or verdict of guilty, the court must impose the punishment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Summary Disposition.</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, the court (other than a magistrate judge) may summarily punish a person who commits criminal contempt in its presence if the judge saw or heard the contemptuous conduct and so certifies; a magistrate judge may summarily punish a person as provided in 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(e). The contempt order must recite the facts, be signed by the judge, and be filed with the clerk.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule-making power of the Supreme Court with respect to criminal proceedings was extended to proceedings to punish for criminal contempt of court by the Act of November 21, 1941 (55 Stat. 779), 18 U.S.C. 689 [see 3771, 3772].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law, <em>Ex parte Terry</em>, 128 U.S. 289; <em>Cooke v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 517, 534.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). 1. This rule is substantially a restatement of the procedure prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 386&ndash;390 [now 18 U.S.C. 401, 402, 3285, 3691], and 29 U.S.C. 111 [now 18 U.S.C. 3692].</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The requirement in the second sentence that the notice shall describe the criminal contempt as such is intended to obviate the frequent confusion between criminal and civil contempt proceedings and follows the suggestion made in <em>McCann v. New York Stock Exchange</em>, 80 F.2d 211 (C.C.A. 2d). See also <em>Nye v. United States</em>, 313 U.S. 33, 42&ndash;43.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The fourth sentence relating to trial by jury preserves the right to a trial by jury in those contempt cases in which it is granted by statute, but does not enlarge the right or extend it to additional cases. The respondent in a contempt proceeding may demand a trial by jury as of right if the proceeding is brought under the Act of March 23, 1932, c. 90, sec. 11, 47 Stat. 72, 29 U.S.C. 111 [now 18 U.S.C. 3692] (Norris-La Guardia Act), or the Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, sec. 22, 38 Stat. 738, 28 U.S.C. 387 (Clayton Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The provision in the sixth sentence disqualifying the judge affected by the contempt if the charge involves disrespect to or criticism of him, is based, in part, on 29 U.S.C. former &sect;112 (Contempts; demand for retirement of judge sitting in proceeding) and the observations of Chief Justice Taft in <em>Cooke v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 517, 539, 45 S.Ct. 390, 69 L.Ed. 767.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 42 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised rule is intended to more clearly set out the procedures for conducting a criminal contempt proceeding. The current rule implicitly recognizes that an attorney for the government may be involved in the prosecution of such cases. Revised Rule 42(a)(2) now explicitly addresses the appointment of a &ldquo;prosecutor&rdquo; and adopts language to reflect the holding in <em>Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton</em>, 481 U.S. 787 (1987). In that case the Supreme Court indicated that ordinarily the court should request that an attorney for the government prosecute the contempt; only if that request is denied, should the court appoint a private prosecutor. The rule envisions that a disinterested counsel should be appointed to prosecute the contempt.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 42(b) has been amended to make it clear that a court may summarily punish a person for committing contempt in the court's presence without regard to whether other rules, such as Rule 32 (sentencing procedures), might otherwise apply. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Martin-Trigona</em>, 759 F.2d 1017 (2d Cir. 1985). Further, Rule 42(b) has been amended to recognize the contempt powers of a court (other than a magistrate judge) and a magistrate judge.</p>
