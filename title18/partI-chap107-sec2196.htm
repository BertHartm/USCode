<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 704 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping (R.S. &sect;4602).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;officer, radio operator,&rdquo; and &ldquo;or other person employed on&rdquo; were inserted at beginning of section to insure clarity and scope of section. Section 701 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping, is very similar to this section as revised, and has been applied to mates [<em>Morris v. Cornell</em>, D.C. Mass. 1843, Fed. Cas. No. 9,829; <em>Gladding v. Constant</em>, D.C. Mass. 1844, Fed. Cas. No. 5,468; <em>Foye v. Dabney</em>, D.C. Mass. 1853, Fed. Cas. No. 5,022; <em>Foye v. Lickie</em>, D.C. Mass. 1853, Fed. Cas. No. 5,023; <em>The Sylvia De Grasse</em>, D.C.N.Y. 1843, Fed. Cas. No. 12,676; <em>The Sadie C. Sumner</em>, D.C. Mass. 1905, 142 F. 611], as well as engineers, assistant engineers and cooks. (See notes of decisions under section 701, of title 46, U.S.C., Shipping.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;be guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary in view of general definition of &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology including substitution of &ldquo;one year&rdquo; for &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; at end of section.</p>
