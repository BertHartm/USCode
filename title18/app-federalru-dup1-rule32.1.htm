<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Preliminary Hearing</em>. Whenever a person is held in custody on the ground that the person has violated a condition of probation or supervised release, the person shall be afforded a prompt hearing before any judge, or a United States magistrate&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_32.1_1_target" name="Rule_32.1_1">1</a></sup> who has been given the authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;636 to conduct such hearings, in order to determine whether there is probably&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_32.1_2_target" name="Rule_32.1_2">2</a></sup> cause to hold the person for a revocation hearing. The person shall be given</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notice of the preliminary hearing and its purpose and of the alleged violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an opportunity to appear at the hearing and present evidence in the person's own behalf;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) upon request, the opportunity to question witnesses against the person unless, for good cause, the federal magistrate decides that justice does not require the appearance of the witness; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) notice of the person's right to be represented by counsel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The proceedings shall be recorded stenographically or by an electronic recording device. If probable cause is found to exist, the person shall be held for a revocation hearing. The person may be released pursuant to Rule 46(c) pending the revocation hearing. If probable cause is not found to exist, the proceeding shall be dismissed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Revocation Hearing</em>. The revocation hearing, unless waived by the person, shall be held within a reasonable time in the district of jurisdiction. The person shall be given</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) written notice of the alleged violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) disclosure of the evidence against the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an opportunity to appear and to present evidence in the person's own behalf;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(1). Since <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli</em>, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), it is clear that a probationer can no longer be denied due process in reliance on the dictum in <em>Escoe v. Zerbst</em>, 295 U.S. 490, 492 (1935), that probation is an &ldquo;act of grace.&rdquo; See Van Alstyne, The Demise of the Right-Privilege Distinction in Constitutional Law, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 1439 (1968); President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. Task Force Report: Corrections 86 (1967).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:110 --><p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1) requires, consistent with the holding in <em>Scarpelli</em>, that a prompt preliminary hearing must be held whenever &ldquo;a probationer is held in custody on the ground that he has violated a condition of his probation.&rdquo; See 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653 regarding arrest of the probationer with or without a warrant. If there is to be a revocation hearing but there has not been a holding in custody for a probation violation, there need not be a preliminary hearing. It was the fact of such a holding in custody &ldquo;which prompted the Court to determine that a preliminary as well as a final revocation hearing was required to afford the petitioner due process of law.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Tucker</em>, 524 F.2d 77 (5th Cir. 1975). Consequently, a preliminary hearing need not be held if the probationer was at large and was not arrested but was allowed to appear voluntarily, <em>United States v. Strada</em>, 503 F.2d 1081 (8th Cir. 1974), or in response to a show cause order which &ldquo;merely requires his appearance in court,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Langford</em>, 369 F.Supp. 1107 (N.D.Ill. 1973); if the probationer was in custody pursuant to a new charge, <em>Thomas v. United States</em>, 391 F.Supp. 202 (W.D.Pa. 1975), or pursuant to a final conviction of a subsequent offense, <em>United States v. Tucker</em>, supra; or if he was arrested but obtained his release.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(A), (B) and (C) list the requirements for the preliminary hearing, as developed in <em>Morrissey</em> and made applicable to probation revocation cases in <em>Scarpelli</em>. Under (A), the probationer is to be given notice of the hearing and its purpose and of the alleged violation of probation. &ldquo;Although the allegations in a motion to revoke probation need not be as specific as an indictment, they must be sufficient to apprise the probationer of the conditions of his probation which he is alleged to have violated, as well as the dates and events which support the charge.&rdquo; <em>Kartman v. Parratt</em>, 397 F.Supp. 531 (D.Nebr. 1975). Under (B), the probationer is permitted to appear and present evidence in his own behalf. And under (C), <em>upon request</em> by the probationer, adverse witnesses shall be made available for questioning unless the magistrate determines that the informant would be subjected to risk or harm if his identity were disclosed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(D) provides for notice to the probationer of his right to be represented by counsel at the preliminary hearing. Although <em>Scarpelli</em> did not impose as a constitutional requirement a right to counsel in all instances, under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(b) a defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel whenever charged &ldquo;with a violation of probation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The federal magistrate (see definition in rule 54(c)) is to keep a record of what transpires at the hearing and, if he finds probable cause of a violation, hold the probationer for a revocation hearing. The probationer may be released pursuant to rule 46(c) pending the revocation hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(2). Subdivision (a)(2) mandates a final revocation hearing within a reasonable time to determine whether the probationer has, in fact, violated the conditions of his probation and whether his probation should be revoked. Ordinarily this time will be measured from the time of the probable cause finding (if a preliminary hearing was held) or of the issuance of an order to show cause. However, what constitutes a reasonable time must be determined on the facts of the particular case, such as whether the probationer is available or could readily be made available. If the probationer has been convicted of and is incarcerated for a new crime, and that conviction is the basis of the pending revocation proceedings, it would be relevant whether the probationer waived appearance at the revocation hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">The hearing required by rule 32.1(a)(2) is not a formal trial; the usual rules of evidence need not be applied. See <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, supra (&ldquo;the process should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial&rdquo;); Rule 1101(d)(e) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (rules not applicable to proceedings &ldquo;granting or revoking probation&rdquo;). Evidence that would establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required to support an order revoking probation. <em>United States v. Francischine</em>, 512 F.2d 827 (5th Cir. 1975). This hearing may be waived by the probationer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivisions (a)(2)(A)&ndash;(E) list the rights to which a probationer is entitled at the final revocation hearing. The final hearing is less a summary one because the decision under consideration is the ultimate decision to revoke rather than a mere determination of probable cause. Thus, the probationer has certain rights not granted at the preliminary hearing: (i) the notice under (A) must by written; (ii) under (B) disclosure of all the evidence against the probationer is required; and (iii) under (D) the probationer does not have to specifically request the right to confront adverse witnesses, and the court may not limit the opportunity to question the witnesses against him.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (a)(2)(E) the probationer must be given notice of his right to be represented by counsel. Although <em>Scarpelli</em> holds that the Constitution does not compel counsel in all probation revocation hearings, under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(b) a defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel whenever charged &ldquo;with a violation of probation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Revocation of probation is proper if the court finds a violation of the conditions of probation and that such violation warrants revocation. Revocation followed by imprisonment is an appropriate disposition if the court finds on the basis of the original offense and the intervening conduct of the probationer that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) confinement is necessary to protect the public from further criminal activity by the offender; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) the offender is in need of correctional treatment which can most effectively be provided if he is confined; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) it would unduly depreciate the seriousness of the violation if probation were not revoked.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Probation &sect;5.1 (Approved Draft, 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">If probation is revoked, the probationer may be required to serve the sentence originally imposed, or any lesser sentence, and if imposition of sentence was suspended he may receive any sentence which might have been imposed. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653. When a split sentence is imposed under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3651 and probation is subsequently revoked, the probationer is entitled to credit for the time served in jail but not for the time he was on probation. <em>Thomas v. United States</em>, 327 F.2d 795 (10th Cir.), cert, denied 377 U.S. 1000 (1964); <em>Schley v. Peyton</em>, 280 F.Supp. 307 (W.D.Va. 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). Subdivision (b) concerns proceedings on modification of probation (as provided for in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3651). The probationer should have the right to apply to the sentencing court for a clarification or change of conditions. American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Probation &sect;3.1(c) (Approved Draft, 1970). This avenue is important for two reasons: (1) the probationer should be able to obtain resolution of a dispute over an ambiguous term or the meaning of a condition without first having to violate it; and (2) in cases of neglect, overwork, or simply unreasonableness on the part of the probation officer, the probationer should have recourse to the sentencing court when a condition needs clarification or modification.</p>
<p class="note-body">Probation conditions should be subject to modification, for the sentencing court must be able to respond to changes in the probationer's circumstances as well as new ideas and methods of rehabilitation. See generally ABA Standards, supra, &sect;3.3. The Sentencing court is given the authority to shorten the term or end probation early upon its own motion without a hearing. And while the modification of probation is a part of the sentencing procedure, so that the probationer is ordinarily entitled to a hearing and presence of counsel, a modification favorable to the probationer may be accomplished without a hearing in the presence of defendant and counsel. <em>United States v. Bailey</em>, 343 F.Supp. 76 (W.D.Mo. 1971).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments recognize that convicted defendants may be on supervised release as well as on probation. See 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3583, and 3624(e).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The addition of subdivision (c) is one of several amendments that extend Rule 26.2 to Rules 32(f), 32.1, 46, and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. As noted in the Committee Note to Rule 26.2, the primary reason for extending that Rule to other hearings and proceedings rests heavily upon the compelling need for accurate information affecting the witnesses&rsquo; credibility. While that need is certainly clear in a trial on the merits, it is equally compelling, if not more so, in other pretrial and post-trial proceedings in which both the prosecution and defense have high interests at stake. In the case of revocation or modification of probation or supervised release proceedings, not only is the defendant's liberty interest at stake, the government has a stake in protecting the interests of the community.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring production of witness statements at hearings conducted under Rule 32.1 will enhance the procedural due process which the rule now provides and which the Supreme Court required in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, 408 U.S. 471 (1972) and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli</em>, 411 U.S. 778 (1973). Access to prior statements of a witness will enhance the ability of both the defense and prosecution to test the credibility of the other side's witnesses under Rule 32.1(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) and thus will assist the court in assessing credibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">A witness's statement must be produced only if the witness testifies.</p>
