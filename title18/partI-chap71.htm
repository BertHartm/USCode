<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;334 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;211, 35 Stat. 1429 [1129]; Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 241, &sect;2, 36 Stat. 1339).</p>
<p class="note-body">The attention of Congress is invited to the following decisions of the Federal courts construing this section and section 1462 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Youngs Rubber Corporation, Inc. v. C. I. Lee & Co., Inc</em>., C.C.A. 1930, 45 F. 2d 103, it was said that the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; as used in this section and in section 1462 of this title, the latter relating to importation and transportation of obscene matter, is not to be construed literally, the more reasonable interpretation being to construe the whole phrase &ldquo;designed, adapted or intended&rdquo; as requiring &ldquo;an intent on the part of the sender that the article mailed or shipped by common carrier be used for illegal contraception or abortion or for indecent or immoral purposes.&rdquo; The court pointed out that, taken literally, the language of these sections would seem to forbid the transportation by mail or common carrier of anything &ldquo;adapted,&rdquo; in the sense of being suitable or fitted, for preventing conception or for any indecent or immoral purpose, &ldquo;even though the article might also be capable of legitimate uses and the sender in good faith supposed that it would be used only legitimately. Such a construction would prevent mailing to or by a physician of any drug or mechanical device &lsquo;adapted&rsquo; for contraceptive or abortifacient uses, although the physician desired to use or to prescribe it for proper medical purposes. The intention to prevent a proper medical use of drugs or other articles merely because they are capable of illegal uses is not lightly to be ascribed to Congress. Section 334 [this section] forbids also the mailing of obscene books and writings; yet it has never been thought to bar from the mails medical writings sent to or by physicians for proper purposes, though of a character which would render them highly indecent if sent broadcast to all classes of persons.&rdquo; In <em>United States v. Nicholas</em>, C.C.A. 1938, 97 F. 2d 510, ruling directly on this point, it was held that the importation or sending through the mails of contraceptive articles or publications is not forbidden absolutely, but only when such articles or publications are unlawfully employed. The same rule was followed in <em>Davis v. United States</em>, C.C.A. 1933, 62 F. 2d 473, quoting the obiter opinion from <em>Youngs Rubber Corporation v. C. I. Lee & Co., supra</em>, and holding that the intent of the person mailing a circular conveying information for preventing conception that the article described therein should be used for condemned purposes was necessary for a conviction; also that this section must be given a reasonable construction. (See also <em>United States v. One Package</em>, C.C.A. 1936, 86 F. 2d 737.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;principal&rdquo; in section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in phraseology were made.</p>
