<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Interest on Fines and restitution.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The defendant shall pay interest on any fine or restitution of more than $2,500, unless the fine is paid in full before the fifteenth day after the date of the judgment.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Modification of interest by court</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court determines that the defendant does not have the ability to pay interest under this subsection, the court may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) waive the requirement for interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) limit the total of interest payable to a specific dollar amount; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />

If a fine or restitution becomes in default, the defendant shall pay, as a penalty, an additional amount equal to 15 percent of the principal amount that is in default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Interest or Penalty by Attorney General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General may <!-- PDFPage:685 -->waive all or part of any interest or penalty under this section or any interest or penalty relating to a fine imposed under any prior law if, as determined by the Attorney General, reasonable efforts to collect the interest or penalty are not likely to be effective.</p>
