<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 305d of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 748, &sect;5, 49 Stat. 892).</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference to the offense as a misdemeanor was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Maximum fine was changed from $2,000 to $500 to bring the offense within the category of petty offenses defined by section 1 of this title. (See reviser's note under section 1157 of this title.)</p>
