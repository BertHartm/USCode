<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 592, 597 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. &sect;5209; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;22(i) as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, &sect;3, 48 Stat. 1107; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, &sect;7, 40 Stat. 972; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;316, 49 Stat. 712).</p>
<p class="note-body">(See reviser's note under section 656 of this title for comprehensive statement of reasons for separating section 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, into three revised sections, and section 597 thereof into two revised sections, with the consequent extensive changes in phraseology, style, and arrangement.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In this section, national bank receivers and Federal reserve agents were not included in the initial enumeration of persons at whom the act is directed, since the provisions of this section, unlike section 656 of this title, are not directed at such receivers and agents.</p>
<p class="note-body">No changes of meaning or substance were made, except that, like said section 656 of this title, the different punishment provisions were reconciled, and one uniform punishment provision was adopted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of a misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;and upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since section 3231 of this title gives the district court jurisdiction of criminal prosecutions, the words &ldquo;in any district court of the United States&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary.</p>
