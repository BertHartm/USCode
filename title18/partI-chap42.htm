<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this chapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To extend credit means to make or renew any loan, or to enter into any agreement, tacit or express, whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim, whether acknowledged or disputed, valid or invalid, and however arising, may or will be deferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo;, with reference to any given extension of credit, refers to any person making that extension of credit, or to any person claiming by, under, or through any person making that extension of credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The term &ldquo;debtor&rdquo;, with reference to any given extension of credit, refers to any person to whom that extension of credit is made, or to any person who guarantees the repayment of that extension of credit, or in any manner undertakes to indemnify the creditor against loss resulting from the failure of any person to whom that extension of credit is made to repay the same.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The repayment of any extension of credit includes the repayment, satisfaction, or discharge in whole or in part of any debt or claim, acknowledged or disputed, valid or invalid, resulting from or in connection with that extension of credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) To collect an extension of credit means to induce in any way any person to make repayment thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) An extortionate extension of credit is any extension of credit with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) An extortionate means is any means which involves the use, or an express or implicit threat of use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The term &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessions of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) State law, including conflict of laws rules, governing the enforceability through civil judicial processes of repayment of any extension of credit or the performance of any promise given in consideration thereof shall be judicially noticed. This paragraph does not impair any authority which any court would otherwise have to take judicial notice of any matter of State law.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 201 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;321 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Organized crime is interstate and international in character. Its activities involve many billions of dollars each year. It is directly responsible for murders, willful injuries to person and property, corruption of officials, and terrorization of countless citizens. A substantial part of the income of organized crime is generated by extortionate credit transactions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Extortionate credit transactions are characterized by the use, or the express or implicit threat of the use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to person, reputation, or property as a means of enforcing repayment. Among the factors which have rendered past efforts at prosecution almost wholly ineffective has been the existence of exclusionary rules of evidence stricter than necessary for the protection of constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Extortionate credit transactions are carried on to a substantial extent in interstate and foreign commerce and through the means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where extortionate credit transactions are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate and foreign commerce.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:183 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Extortionate credit transactions directly impair the effectiveness and frustrate the purposes of the laws enacted by the Congress on the subject of bankruptcies.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of chapter 42 of title 18 of the United States Code are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform and effective laws on the subject of bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Annual Report to Congress by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 203 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;321 directed Attorney General to make an annual report to Congress of activities of Department of Justice in enforcement of this chapter, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 97&ndash;375, title I, &sect;109(b), Dec. 21, 1982, 96 Stat. 1820.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whoever makes any extortionate extension of credit, or conspires to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In any prosecution under this section, if it is shown that all of the following factors were present in connection with the extension of credit in question, there is prima facie evidence that the extension of credit was extortionate, but this subsection is nonexclusive and in no way limits the effect or applicability of subsection (a):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The repayment of the extension of credit, or the performance of any promise given in consideration thereof, would be unenforceable, through civil judicial processes against the debtor</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the jurisdiction within which the debtor, if a natural person, resided or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in every jurisdiction within which the debtor, if other than a natural person, was incorporated or qualified to do business</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">at the time the extension of credit was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The extension of credit was made at a rate of interest in excess of an annual rate of 45 per centum calculated according to the actuarial method of allocating payments made on a debt between principal and interest, pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the accumulated interest and the balance is applied to the unpaid principal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) At the time the extension of credit was made, the debtor reasonably believed that either</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) one or more extensions of credit by the creditor had been collected or attempted to be collected by extortionate means, or the nonrepayment thereof had been punished by extortionate means; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the creditor had a reputation for the use of extortionate means to collect extensions of credit or to punish the nonrepayment thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Upon the making of the extension of credit, the total of the extensions of credit by the creditor to the debtor then outstanding, including any unpaid interest or similar charges, exceeded $100.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In any prosecution under this section, if evidence has been introduced tending to show the existence of any of the circumstances described in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2), and direct evidence of the actual belief of the debtor as to the creditor's collection practices is not available, then for the purpose of showing the understanding of the debtor and the creditor at the time the extension of credit was made, the court may in its discretion allow evidence to be introduced tending to show the reputation as to collection practices of the creditor in any community of which the debtor was a member at the time of the extension.</p>
