<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;387 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;237, 35 Stat. 1136).</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;principal&rdquo; in section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;in interstate or foreign commerce&rdquo; were substituted for involved enumeration of places, thus permitting section to be condensed and simplified without change of meaning. See definitive section 10 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rewritten punishment provision is in lieu of the following: &ldquo;for the first offense, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both; and for any subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not more than two years&rdquo;. There seems no point in fixing a punishment for a second offense less than that for the first offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
