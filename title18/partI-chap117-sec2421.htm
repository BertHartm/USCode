<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;397, 398, 401, 404 (June 25, 1910, ch. 395, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 5, 8, 36 Stat. 825&ndash;827).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 397, 398, 401, and 404 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 397 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., containing a definition of the terms &ldquo;interstate commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign commerce&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of those terms in section 10 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 401 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., prescribing venue was omitted as unnecessary in view of section 3237 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 403 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted. No definition of &ldquo;Territory&rdquo; is necessary to the revised section as it is phrased. Construction therein of &ldquo;person&rdquo; is covered by section 1 of title 1, U.S.C., 1940 ed., General Provisions, as amended. Last paragraph of said section relating to construction of this chapter was omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;Possession of the United States&rdquo; were inserted in three places in view of mission of said section 403 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and, reference in that section to the Canal Zone is covered by those words. This chapter applies to the Territory of Hawaii. (See <em>Sun Chong Lee v. United States</em>, C.C.A. Hawaii, 1942, 125 F. 2d 95.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 404 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., containing the short title was omitted as not appropriate in a revision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was deleted as unnecessary because such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were also deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;deemed guilty of a felony&rdquo; were deleted as unnecessary in view of the definition of a felony in section 1 of this title. (See reviser's note under section 550 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were also made in translations and phraseology.</p>
