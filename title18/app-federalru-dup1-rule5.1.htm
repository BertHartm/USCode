<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Probable Cause Finding</cap-smallcap>. If from the evidence it appears that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it, the federal magistrate judge shall forthwith hold the defendant to answer in district court. The finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part. The defendant may cross-examine adverse witnesses and may introduce evidence. Objections to evidence on the ground that it was acquired by unlawful means are not properly made at the preliminary examination. Motions to suppress must be made to the trial court as provided in Rule 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Discharge of Defendant</cap-smallcap>. If from the evidence it appears that there is no probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed or that the defendant committed it, the federal magistrate judge shall dismiss the complaint and discharge the defendant. The discharge of the defendant shall not preclude the government from instituting a subsequent prosecution for the same offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Records</cap-smallcap>. After concluding the proceeding the federal magistrate judge shall transmit forthwith to the clerk of the district court all papers in the proceeding. The magistrate judge shall promptly make or cause to be made a record or summary of such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) On timely application to a federal magistrate judge, the attorney for a defendant in a criminal case may be given the opportunity to have the recording of the hearing on preliminary examination made available to that attorney in connection with any further hearing or preparation for trial. The court may, by local rule, appoint the place for and define the conditions under which such opportunity may be afforded counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) On application of a defendant addressed to the court or any judge thereof, an order may issue that the federal magistrate judge make available a copy of the transcript, or of a portion thereof, to defense counsel. Such order shall provide for prepayment of costs of such transcript by the defendant unless the defendant makes a sufficient affidavit that the defendant is unable to pay or to give security therefor, in which case the expense shall be paid by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from available appropriated funds. Counsel for the government may move also that a copy of the transcript, in whole or in part, be made available to it, for good cause shown, and an order may be entered granting such motion in whole or in part, on appropriate terms, except that the government need not prepay costs nor furnish security therefor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Production of Statements.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General</em>. Rule 26.2(a)&ndash;(d) and (f) applies at any hearing under this rule, unless the court, for good cause shown, rules otherwise in a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Sanctions for Failure to Produce Statement</em>. If a party elects not to comply with an order under Rule 26.2(a) to deliver a statement to the moving party, the court may not consider the testimony of a witness whose statement is withheld.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1 is, for the most part, a clarification of old rule 5(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the new rule, the preliminary examination must be conducted before a &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; as defined in rule 54. Giving state or local judicial officers authority to conduct a preliminary examination does not seem necessary. There are not likely to be situations in which a &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; is not &ldquo;reasonably available&rdquo; to conduct the preliminary examination, which is usually not held until several days after the initial appearance provided for in rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) makes clear that a finding of probable cause may be based on &ldquo;hearsay evidence in whole or in part.&rdquo; The propriety of relying upon hearsay at the preliminary examination has been a matter of some uncertainty in the federal system. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 (1969, Supp. 1971); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;504[4] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971); <em>Washington v. Clemmer</em>, 339 F.2d 715, 719 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Washington v. Clemmer</em>, 339 F.2d 725, 728 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Ross v. Sirica</em>, 380 F.2d 557, 565 (D.C. Cir. 1967); <em>Howard v. United States</em>, 389 F.2d 287, 292 (D.C. Cir. 1967); Weinberg and Weinberg, The Congressional Invitation to Avoid the Preliminary Hearing: An Analysis of Section 303 of the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, 67 Mich.L.Rev. 1361, especially n. 92 at 1383 (1969); D. Wright, The Rules of Evidence Applicable to Hearings in Probable Cause, 37 Conn.B.J. 561 (1963); Comment, Preliminary Examination&mdash;Evidence and Due Process, 15 Kan.L.Rev. 374, 379&ndash;381 (1967).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:22 --><p class="note-body">A grand jury indictment may properly be based upon hearsay evidence. <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359 (1956); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;6.03[2] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971). This being so, there is practical advantage in making the evidentiary requirements for the preliminary examination as flexible as they are for the grand jury. Otherwise there will be increased pressure upon United States Attorneys to abandon the preliminary examination in favor of the grand jury indictment. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 at p. 143 (1969). New York State, which also utilizes both the preliminary examination and the grand jury, has under consideration a new Code of Criminal Procedure which would allow the use of hearsay at the preliminary examination. See McKinney's Session Law News, April 10, 1969, pp. A119&ndash;A120.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the same reason, subdivision (a) also provides that the preliminary examination is not the proper place to raise the issue of illegally obtained evidence. This is current law. In <em>Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480, 484 (1958), the Supreme Court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-block">[T]he Commissioner here had no authority to adjudicate the admissibility at petitioner's later trial of the heroin taken from his person. That issue was for the trial court. This is specifically recognized by Rule 41(e) of the Criminal Rules, which provides that a defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may &ldquo;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* move the district court *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to suppress for use as evidence anything so obtained on the ground that *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; the arrest warrant was defective on any of several grounds.</p>
<p class="note-body">Dicta in <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359, 363&ndash;364 (1956), and <em>United States v. Blue</em>, 384 U.S. 251, 255 (1966), also support the proposed rule. In <em>United States ex rel. Almeida v. Rundle</em>, 383 F.2d 421, 424 (3d Cir. 1967), the court, in considering the adequacy of an indictment said:</p>
<p class="note-body">On this score, it is settled law that (1) &ldquo;[an] indictment returned by a legally constituted nonbiased grand jury, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is enough to call for a trial of the charge on the merits and satisfies the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.&rdquo;, <em>Lawn v. United States</em>, 355 U.S. 399, 349, 78 S.Ct. 311, 317, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958); (2) an indictment cannot be challenged &ldquo;on the ground that there was inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury&rdquo;, <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 408, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956); and (3) a prosecution is not abated, nor barred, even where &ldquo;tainted evidence&rdquo; has been submitted to a grand jury, <em>United States v. Blue</em>, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 at 143 n. 5 (1969, Supp. 1971) 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;6.03[3] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971). The Manual for United States Commissioners (Administrative Office of United States Courts, 1948) provides at pp. 24&ndash;25: &ldquo;Motions for this purpose [to suppress illegally obtained evidence] may be made and heard only before a district judge. Commissioners are not empowered to consider or act upon such motions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been urged that the rules of evidence at the preliminary examination should be those applicable at the trial because the purpose of the preliminary examination should be, not to review the propriety of the arrest or prior detention, but rather to determine whether there is evidence sufficient to justify subjecting the defendant to the expense and inconvenience of trial. See Weinberg and Weinberg, The Congressional Invitation to Avoid the Preliminary Hearing: An Analysis of Section 303 of the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, 67 Mich. L. Rev. 1361, 1396&ndash;1399 (1969). The rule rejects this view for reasons largely of administrative necessity and the efficient administration of justice. The Congress has decided that a preliminary examination shall not be required when there is a grand jury indictment (18 U.S.C. &sect;3060). Increasing the procedural and evidentiary requirements applicable to the preliminary examination will therefore add to the administrative pressure to avoid the preliminary examination. Allowing objections to evidence on the ground that evidence has been illegally obtained would require two determinations of admissibility, one before the United States magistrate and one in the district court. The objective is to reduce, not increase, the number of preliminary motions.</p>
<p class="note-body">To provide that a probable cause finding may be based upon hearsay does not preclude the magistrate from requiring a showing that admissible evidence will be available at the time of trial. See Comment, Criminal Procedure&mdash;Grand Jury&mdash;Validity of Indictment Based Solely on Hearsay Questioned When Direct Testimony Is Readily Available, 43 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 578 (1968); <em>United States v. Umans</em>, 368 F.2d. 725 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted 389 U.S. 80 (1967); <em>United States v. Andrews</em>, 381 F.2d 377, 378 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>United States v. Messina</em>, 388 F.2d 393, 394 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1968); and <em>United States v. Beltram</em>. 388 F.2d 449 (2d Cir. 1968); and <em>United States v. Arcuri</em>, 282 F.Supp. 347 (E.D.N.Y. 1968). The fact that a defendant is not entitled to object to evidence alleged to have been illegally obtained does not deprive him of an opportunity for a pretrial determination of the admissibility of evidence. He can raise such an objection prior to trial in accordance with the provisions of rule 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) makes it clear that the United States magistrate may not only discharge the defendant but may also dismiss the complaint. Current federal law authorizes the magistrate to discharge the defendant but he must await authorization from the United States Attorney before he can close his records on the case by dismissing the complaint. Making dismissal of the complaint a separate procedure accomplishes no worthwhile objective, and the new rule makes it clear that the magistrate can both discharge the defendant and file the record with the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) also deals with the legal effect of a discharge of a defendant at a preliminary examination. This issue is not dealt with explicitly in the old rule. Existing federal case law is limited. What cases there are seem to support the right of the government to issue a new complaint and start over. See <em>e.q., Collins v. Loisel</em>, 262 U.S. 426 (1923); <em>Morse v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 80 (1925). State law is similar. See <em>People v. Dillon</em>, 197 N.Y. 254, 90 N.E. 820 (1910; <em>Tell v. Wolke</em>, 21 Wis.2d 613, 124 N.W.2d 655 (1963). In the <em>Tell</em> case the Wisconsin court stated the common rationale for allowing the prosecutor to issue a new complaint and start over:</p>
<p class="note-body">The state has no appeal from errors of law committed by a magistrate upon preliminary examination and the discharge on a preliminary would operate as an unchallengeable acquittal.  The only way an error of law committed on the preliminary examination prejudicial to the state may be challenged or corrected is by a preliminary examination on a second complaint. (21 Wis. 2d at 619&ndash;620.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is based upon old rule 5(c) and upon the Federal Magistrates Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060(f). It provides methods for making available to counsel the record of the preliminary examination. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;82 (1969, Supp. 1971). The new rule is designed to eliminate delay and expense occasioned by preparation of transcripts where listening to the tape recording would be sufficient. Ordinarily the recording should be made available pursuant to subdivision (c)(1). A written transcript may be provided under subdivision (c)(2) at the discretion of the court, a discretion which must be exercised in accordance with <em>Britt v. North Carolina</em>, 404 U.S. 226, 30 L.Ed.2d 400, 405 (1971):</p>
<p class="note-body">A defendant who claims the right to a free transcript does not, under our cases, bear the burden of proving inadequate such alternatives as may be suggested by the State or conjured up by a court in hindsight. In this case, however, petitioner has conceded that he had available an informal alternative which appears to be substantially equivalent to a transcript. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court below was in error in rejecting his claim.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The addition of subdivision (d) mirrors similar amendments made in 1993 which extended the scope of Rule 26.2 to Rules 32, 32.1, 46 and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. As indicated in the Committee Notes accompanying those amendments, the primary reason for extending the coverage of Rule 26.2 rested heavily upon the compelling need for accurate information affecting a witness&rsquo; credibility. That need, the Committee believes, extends to a preliminary examination under this rule where both the prosecution and the defense have high interests at stake.</p>
<p class="note-body">A witness&rsquo; statement must be produced only after the witness has personally testified.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 5.1 After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Committee made no changes to the published draft.</p>
