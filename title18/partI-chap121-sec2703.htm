<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) obtains a court order for such disclosure under subsection (d) of this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that delayed notice may be given pursuant to section 2705 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) is applicable with respect to any electronic communication that is held or maintained on that service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on behalf of, and received by means of electronic transmission from (or created by means of computer processing of communications received by means of electronic transmission from), a subscriber or customer of such remote computing service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing services to such subscriber or customer, if the provider is not authorized to access the contents of any such communications for purposes of providing any services other than storage or computer processing.</p>
