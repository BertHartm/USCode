<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;313 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;190, 35 Stat. 1124).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;used by&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;in use by or belonging to&rdquo; in order to limit the application of the section to property used by the Post Office Department. Theft of public property belonging to governmental departments is covered by section 641 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">A fine of &ldquo;$1,000&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;$200,&rdquo; thus increasing the maximum to conform with other comparable sections. (See section 1705 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The smaller penalty for an offense involving property valued at $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in phraseology were made.</p>
