<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body"> Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;77a (Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 740, &sect;201, 49 Stat. 877).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; were omitted. (See definitive section 1 of this title.) Words &ldquo;and upon conviction thereof&rdquo; preceding &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Maximum imprisonment provision was changed from 1 year to 3 years so as to be consistent with sections 911 and 912 of this title, the latter having also been changed to 3 years. There is no sound reason why a uniform punishment should not be prescribed for the offenses defined in these three sections.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
