<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Pre-judgment Probation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person found guilty of an offense described in section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 844)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has not, prior to the commission of such offense, been convicted of violating a Federal or State law relating to controlled substances; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has not previously been the subject of a disposition under this subsection;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the court may, with the consent of such person, place him on probation for a term of not more than one year without entering a judgment of conviction. At any time before the expiration of the term of probation, if the person has not violated a condition of his probation, the court may, without entering a judgment of conviction, dismiss the proceedings against the person and discharge him from probation. At the expiration of the term of probation, if the person has not violated a condition of his probation, the court shall, without entering a judgment of conviction, dismiss the proceedings against the person and discharge him from probation. If the person violates a condition of his probation, the court shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 3565.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Record of Disposition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A nonpublic record of a disposition under subsection (a), or a conviction that is the subject of an expungement order under subsection (c), shall be retained by the Department of Justice solely for the purpose of use by the courts in determining in any subsequent proceeding whether a person qualifies for the disposition provided in subsection (a) or the expungement provided in subsection (c). A disposition under subsection (a), or a conviction that is the subject of an expungement order under subsection (c), shall not be considered a conviction for the purpose of a disqualification or a disability imposed by law upon conviction of a crime, or for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Expungement of Record of Disposition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the case against a person found guilty of an offense under section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 844) is the subject of a disposition under subsection (a), and the person was less than twenty-one years old at the time of the offense, the court shall enter an expungement order upon the application of such person. The expungement order shall direct that there be expunged from all official records, except the nonpublic records referred to in subsection (b), all references to his arrest for the offense, the institution of criminal proceedings against him, and the results thereof. The effect of the order shall be to restore such person, in the contemplation of the law, to the status he occupied before such arrest or institution of criminal proceedings. A person concerning whom such an order has been entered shall not be held thereafter under any provision of law to be guilty of perjury, false swearing, or making a false statement by reason of his failure to recite or acknowledge such arrests or institution of criminal proceedings, or the results thereof, in response to an inquiry made of him for any purpose.</p>
