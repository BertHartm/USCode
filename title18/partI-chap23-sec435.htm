<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;184 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;98, 35 Stat. 1106).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or employee&rdquo; were inserted to remove any ambiguity as to scope of section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The offense described in this section involves no moral turpitude, and therefore the punishment provisions were reduced from $2,000 to $1,000 and from 2 years to 1 year, so that the stigma of a felony would not attach to an offender. (See classification of felony and misdemeanor in section 1 of this title and note thereunder.)</p>
<!-- PDFPage:100 --><p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were also made in phraseology.</p>

<p class="note-body">1994&mdash;Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, which directed the amendment of this section by substituting &ldquo;fined under this title&rdquo; for &ldquo;fined not more than $5,000&rdquo;, was executed by making the substitution for &ldquo;fined not more than $1,000&rdquo;, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.</p>
