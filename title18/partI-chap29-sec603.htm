<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes  </h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;209, 212 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;&sect;119, 122, 35 Stat. 1110).  </p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates sections 209 and 212 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change of substance.  </p>
<p class="note-body">To eliminate ambiguity resulting from use of identical words in reference &ldquo;officer or employee of the United States mentioned in section 208 of this title&rdquo; as those appearing in section 208 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now section 602 of this title, words &ldquo;person mentioned in section 602 of this title&rdquo; were inserted.  </p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;from any such person&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, so as to make it clear that the section does not embrace State employees in its provisions. Some Federal agencies are located in State buildings occupied by State employees.  </p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provision was derived from section 212 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (See reviser's note under section 602 of this title.)  </p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.  </p>
