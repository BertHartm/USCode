<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 221 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title IX, &sect;3, 40 Stat. 227; Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 72, &sect;7, 54 Stat. 80).</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory-punishment provision rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Punishment of five years&rsquo; imprisonment was substituted for &ldquo;ten years&rdquo; to conform with other sections embracing offenses of comparable gravity.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;which said rules shall be printed on the passport&rdquo; was omitted as inconsistent with administrative practice and because the existing rules are too voluminous to be printed on a passport.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
