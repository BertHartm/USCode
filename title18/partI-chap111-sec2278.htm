<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 171 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping (Aug. 2, 1882, ch. 374, &sect;8, 22 Stat. 189).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;except as otherwise expressly provided by law&rdquo; were inserted to remove obvious inconsistency between sections 831&ndash;835 of this title, section 170 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping, and this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and&rdquo; were omitted because designation of the offense as a misdemeanor is unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
