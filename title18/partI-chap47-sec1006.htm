<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 1026(b) and 1514(c) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, sections 264(u), 984, 1121, 1138d(c), 1311, 1441(c), 1467(c) and 1731(c) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(c) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;12B(u), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, &sect;8, 48 Stat. 178; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;31, fourth par., 39 Stat. 383; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;211(a), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, &sect;2, 42 Stat. 1459; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, &sect;216(a), 42 Stat. 1471; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, &sect;16(c), 47 Stat. 11; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, &sect;21(c), 47 Stat. 738; Ex. Ord. No. 6084, Mar. 27, 1933; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, &sect;8(c), 48 Stat. 135; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, &sect;64(c), 48 Stat. 268; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, &sect;13, 48 Stat. 347; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, &sect;512(c), 48 Stat. 1265; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;101, 49 Stat. 701; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, &sect;52(b), 50 Stat. 532; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, &sect;514(c), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, &sect;3, 60 Stat. 1064).</p>
<p class="note-body">Each of the eleven sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions relating to embezzlement, false entries, and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligations with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">These were divided and the false entry and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The remaining provisions of each section, relating to embezzlement and misapplication, form the basis for section 657 of this title. That portion of said section 616(c) of title 15, relating to disclosure of information, forms the basis for section 1904 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each revised section condenses and simplifies the constituent provisions without change of substance except as herein indicated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provisions in each section were the same except that in section 1026(b) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., the maximum fine was $5,000. This consolidated section adopts the $10,000 maximum fine provided by the seven other sections.</p>
<p class="note-body">References to persons aiding or abetting contained in sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;receiver,&rdquo; used in sections 1121 and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with reference to Federal intermediate credit banks and agricultural credit corporations, was omitted as this term is undoubtedly embraced in the phrase &ldquo;or connected in any capacity with.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;or of any department or agency of the United States&rdquo; was inserted in order to clarify the sweeping provisions against fraudulent acts and to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitions of &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.)</p>
<!-- PDFPage:251 --><p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo;, contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and upon conviction&rdquo;, contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;in any district court of the United States&rdquo;, contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, because section 3231 of this title confers jurisdiction on the Federal district courts of all crimes and offenses defined in this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The conspiracy provisions of section 1138d(f) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were not added to this consolidated section for reasons stated in reviser's note under section 493 of this title. (See also reviser's note under section 371 of this title.)</p>
