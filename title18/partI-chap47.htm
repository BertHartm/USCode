Ord. No. 6084, Mar. 27, 1933; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, &sect;8(c), 48 Stat. 135; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, &sect;64(c), 48 Stat. 268; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, &sect;13, 48 Stat. 347; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, &sect;512(c), 48 Stat. 1265; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;101, 49 Stat. 701; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, &sect;52(b), 50 Stat. 532; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, &sect;514(c), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, &sect;3, 60 Stat. 1064).</p>
<p class="note-body">Each of the eleven sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions relating to embezzlement, false entries, and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligations with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">These were divided and the false entry and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The remaining provisions of each section, relating to embezzlement and misapplication, form the basis for section 657 of this title. That portion of said section 616(c) of title 15, relating to disclosure of information, forms the basis for section 1904 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each revised section condenses and simplifies the constituent provisions without change of substance except as herein indicated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provisions in each section were the same except that in section 1026(b) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., the maximum fine was $5,000. This consolidated section adopts the $10,000 maximum fine provided by the seven other sections.</p>
<p class="note-body">References to persons aiding or abetting contained in sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;receiver,&rdquo; used in sections 1121 and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with reference to Federal intermediate credit banks and agricultural credit corporations, was omitted as this term is undoubtedly embraced in the phrase &ldquo;or connected in any capacity with.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;or of any department or agency of the United States&rdquo; was inserted in order to clarify the sweeping provisions against fraudulent acts and to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitions of &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo;, contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and upon conviction&rdquo;, contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;in any district court of the United States&rdquo;, contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, because section 3231 of this title confers jurisdiction on the Federal district courts of all crimes and offenses defined in this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The conspiracy provisions of section 1138d(f) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were not added to this consolidated section for reasons stated in reviser's note under section 493 of this title. (See also reviser's note under section 371 of this title.)</p>

<p class="note-body">Each of the 13 sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions either relating to false representations and statements, or overvaluation of security, with respect to one or more of the named banks, agencies, or corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">These were consolidated and the false statement and security overvaluation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The provisions of section 981 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to acceptance of loans or gratuities by examiners, were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 218 [now section 213] of this title. The provisions of said section 981 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, prohibiting land bank and national farm loan association examiners from performing &ldquo;any other service for compensation for any bank or banking or loan association, or for any person connected therewith in any capacity&rdquo; were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 1909 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Eight of the consolidated sections contained identical punishment, each providing for a maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years. Two sections provided for a maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years. One section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years, one section provided for maximum fine of $2,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years, and one section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 1 year.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment by maximum fine of $5,000 or maximum imprisonment of 2 years, or both, provided in this consolidated section was adopted as most consistent with the greater number of comparable sections. (See sections 1008 and 1010 of this title.) This is a reasonable reconciliation of the conflicting punishment provisions and adequate for the offenses described.</p>
<p class="note-body">The enumeration of &ldquo;application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement, commitment, or loan&rdquo; and the wording &ldquo;or any change or extension of any of the same, by renewal, deferment of action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of security therefor&rdquo; does not occur in any one of the original sections, but such enumeration and such wording are adequate, and they represent a composite of terms and transactions mentioned in each.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, changes were made in phraseology to secure uniformity of style, and some rephrasing was necessary, but the consolidation was without change of substance except as above indicated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1138d(f) of Title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to conspiracy, was not added to this consolidated section for reasons given in reviser's note under section 493 of this title.</p>
