<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;51 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;19, 35 Stat. 1092).</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause making conspirator ineligible to hold office was omitted as incongruous because it attaches ineligibility to hold office to a person who may be a private citizen and who was convicted of conspiracy to violate a specific statute. There seems to be no reason for imposing such a penalty in the case of one individual crime, in view of the fact that other crimes do not carry such a severe consequence. The experience of the Department of Justice is that this unusual penalty has been an obstacle to successful prosecutions for violations of the act.</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in phraseology were made.</p>
