<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;746a (July 3, 1926, ch. 795, &sect;2, as added June 21, 1941, ch. 212, 55 Stat. 254).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;informed against&rdquo; was inserted in two places in view of the fact that under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the use of informations may be expected to increase. See Rule 7(b).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:734 --><p class="note-body">The section was extended to cover a person held as a material witness and unable to make bail. His predicament obviously calls for the relief afforded by the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and surplusage omitted.</p>
