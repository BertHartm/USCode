<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;261 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;147, 35 Stat. 1115; Jan. 27, 1938, ch. 10, &sect;3, 52 Stat. 7).</p>
<p class="note-body">The terms of this section were general enough to justify its inclusion in this chapter rather than retaining it in the chapter on &ldquo;Counterfeiting&rdquo; where the terms which it specifically defines are set out in sections 471&ndash;476, 478, 481, 483, 492, and 504 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes&rdquo; were inserted before &ldquo;coupons&rdquo; because such notes have almost supplanted national bank currency.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
