<p class="statutory-body">(b) Disputes as to the price, quality, character, or suitability of such products shall be arbitrated by a board consisting of the Attorney General, the Administrator of General Services, and the President, or their representatives. Their decision shall be final and binding upon all parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each Federal department, agency, and institution subject to the requirements of subsection (a) shall separately report acquisitions of products and services from Federal Prison Industries to the Federal Procurement Data System (as referred to in section 6(d)(4) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act) in the same manner as it reports other acquisitions. Each report published by the Federal Procurement Data System that contains the information collected by the System shall include a statement to accompany the information reported by the department, agency, or institution under the preceding sentence as follows: &ldquo;Under current law, sales by Federal Prison Industries are considered intragovernmental transfers. The purpose of reporting sales by Federal Prison Industries is to provide a complete overview of acquisitions by the Federal Government during the reporting period.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, Federal Prison Industries shall publish a catalog of all products and services which it offers for sale.

<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;744g (May 27, 1930, ch. 340, &sect;7, 46 Stat. 392).</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section substituted the Director of the Bureau of Federal Supply of the Treasury Department for the General Supply Committee, the functions of the <!-- PDFPage:700 -->latter having been transferred to the Procurement Division of the Treasury Department by Executive Order No. 6166, &sect;1, June 10, 1933, and the name of that unit having been changed to Bureau of Federal Supply by order of the Secretary of the Treasury effective January 1, 1947, 11 Federal Register No. 13,638. The Bureau of the Budget was substituted for the Bureau of Efficiency which was abolished by Act of March 3, 1933, ch. 212, &sect;17, 47 Stat. 1519, without transferring its functions elsewhere. However, the Bureau of the Budget performs similar duties and its Director logically should serve on the arbitration board.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to authority for appropriations was omitted and words &ldquo;by this chapter&rdquo; substituted therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;agencies&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;independent establishments&rdquo; to avoid any possibility of ambiguity. See definition of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.</p>
