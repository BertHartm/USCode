<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 548 and 549 of title 18, and sections 212, 213, 215, 217, 218 of title 25, Indians, U.S. Code, 1940 ed. (R.S. &sect;&sect;2142, 2143, 2144, 2145, 2146; Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80, &sect;1, 18 Stat. 318; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;&sect;328, 329, 35 Stat. 1151; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167; June 28, 1932, ch. 284, 47 Stat. 337).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates numerous conflicting and inconsistent provisions of law into a concise statement of the applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;&sect;2145, 2146 (U.S.C., title 25, &sect;&sect;217, 218) extended to the Indian country with notable exceptions the criminal laws of the United States applicable to places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Crimes of Indians against Indians, and crimes punishable by tribal law were excluded.</p>
<p class="note-body">The confusion was not lessened by the cases of <em>U.S. v. McBratney</em>, 104 U.S. 622 and <em>Draper v. U.S</em>., 17 S.Ct. 107, holding that crimes in Indian country by persons not Indians are not cognizable by Federal courts in absence of reservation or cession of exclusive jurisdiction applicable to places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Because of numerous statutes applicable only to Indians and prescribing punishment for crimes committed by Indians against Indians, &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; was defined but once. (See act June 30, 1834, ch. 161, &sect;1, 4, Stat. 729, which was later repealed.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Definition is based on latest construction of the term by the United States Supreme Court in <em>U.S. v. McGowan</em>, 58 S.Ct. 286, 302 U.S. 535, following <em>U.S. v. Sandoval</em>, 34 S.Ct. 1, 5, 231 U.S. 28, 46. (See also <em>Donnelly v. U.S</em>., 33 S.Ct. 449, 228 U.S. 243; and <em>Kills Plenty v. U.S</em>., 133 F.2d 292, certiorari denied, 1943, 63 S.Ct. 1172). (See reviser's note under section 1153 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Indian allotments were included in the definition on authority of the case of <em>U.S. v. Pelican</em>, 1913, 34 S.Ct. 396, 232 U.S. 442, 58 L.Ed. 676.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;548, 549 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;&sect;328, 329, 35 Stat. 1151; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167; June 28, 1932, ch. 284, 47 Stat. 337).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates said sections 548 and 549 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Section 548 of said title covered 10 crimes. Section 549 of said title covered the same except robbery and incest.</p>
<p class="note-body">The 1932 amendment of section 548 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., constituting the last paragraph of the section, is omitted and section 549 of said title to which it applied likewise is omitted. The revised section therefore suffices to cover prosecution of the specific offenses committed on all reservations as intended by Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; were substituted for language relating to jurisdiction extending to reservations and rights-of-way, in view of definitive section 1151 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paul W. Hyatt, president, board of commissioners, Idaho State Bar, recommended that said section 548 be considered with other sections in title 25, Indians, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and revised to insure certainty as to questions of jurisdiction, and punishment on conviction. Insofar as the recommendation came within the scope of this revision, it was followed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proviso in said section 548 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that rape should be defined in accordance with the laws of the State in which the offense was committed, was changed to include burglary so as to clarify the punishment for that offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">Venue provisions of said section 548 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 3242 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 549 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., conferred special jurisdiction on the United States District Court for South Dakota of all crimes of murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, assault with a dangerous weapon, arson, burglary, and larceny committed within the limits of any Indian reservation within the State, whether by or against Indians or non-Indians. The Act of February 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 793, from which said section 549 was derived, accepted the cession by South Dakota of such jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body">The effect of revised sections 1151, 1152, and 1153 of this title is to deprive the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota of jurisdiction of offenses on Indian reservations committed by non-Indians against non-Indians and to restore such jurisdiction to the courts of the State of South Dakota as in other States. This reflects the views of the United States attorney, George Philip, of the district of South Dakota.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1949 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section [section 26] removes an ambiguity in section 1153 of title 18, U.S.C., by eliminating the provision that the crime of rape in the Indian country is to be punished in accordance with the law of the State where the offense was committed, leaving the definition of the offense to be determined by State law, but providing that punishment of rape of an Indian by an Indian is to be by imprisonment at the discretion of the court. The offense of rape, other than rape of an Indian by an Indian within the Indian country, is covered by section 2031 of title 18, U.S.C., and the offense of burglary by sections 1152 and 3242 of such title.</p>

<p class="note-body"><b>2006</b>&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109&ndash;248 inserted &ldquo;felony child abuse or neglect,&rdquo; after &ldquo;years,&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body"><b>1994</b>&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 103&ndash;322 substituted &ldquo;kidnapping&rdquo; for &ldquo;kidnaping&rdquo; and inserted &ldquo;(as defined in section 1365 of this title), an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years&rdquo; after &ldquo;serious bodily injury&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body"><b>1988</b>&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 100&ndash;690 substituted &ldquo;maiming, a felony under chapter 109A, incest&rdquo; for &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;maiming&rsquo; and all that follows through &lsquo;incest&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;, thus clarifying execution of amendment by Pub. L. 99&ndash;646 and Pub. L. 99&ndash;654 but resulting in no change in text. See 1986 Amendment note below.</p>
<p class="note-body"><b>1986</b>&mdash;Pub. L. 99&ndash;646 and Pub. L. 99&ndash;654 which directed that section be amended identically by substituting in first par. &ldquo;a felony under chapter 109A,&rdquo; for &ldquo;rape, involuntary sodomy, carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years, assault with intent to commit rape,&rdquo; and by striking out in second and third pars. &ldquo;,&nbsp;involuntary sodomy,&rdquo; was executed by making the substitution in subsec.

<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 241, 242, 244a, 249, 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (R.S. &sect;2139; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, &sect;1, 19 Stat. 244; July 4, 1884, ch. 180, &sect;1, 23 Stat. 94; July 23, 1892, ch. 234, 27 Stat. 260; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 146, &sect;17, 39 Stat. 983; June 13, 1932, ch. 245, 47 Stat. 302; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396; June 27, 1934, ch. 846, 48 Stat. 1245; June 15, 1938, ch. 435, &sect;1, 52 Stat. 696).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 241, 242, 244a, and 249 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. The portion of section 241 of said title which defined the substantive offense became subsection (a); the portion relating to the scope of the term &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; in section 1151 of this title; the portion of section 241 of said title excepting liquors introduced by the War Department became subsection (c), as limited by section 249 of said title; the portion respecting making complaint in county of offense, and with reference to arraignment, was omitted as covered by rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and the remainder of section 241 of said title was incorporated in section 1156 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, was omitted as covered by this section and section 1156 of this title. That section was enacted in 1934 and excluded from the Indian liquor laws lands outside reservations where the land was no longer held by Indians under a trust patent or a deed or patent containing restrictions against alienation. Such enactment was prior to the June 15, 1938, amendment of section 241 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, in which the term &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; was defined as including allotments where the title was held in trust by the Government or where it was inalienable without the consent of the United States. This provision, by implication, excluded cases where there was no trust or restriction on alienation and thereby achieved the same result as section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. That amendment also repealed the act of Jan. 30, 1897, referred to in section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. Insofar as the reference in section 254 of said title to &ldquo;special Indian liquor laws&rdquo; included section 244 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, the definition of Indian country in section 1151 of this title covers section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or agent&rdquo; were deleted as there have been no Indian agents since 1908. See section 64 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, and note thereunder.</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative and provision for commitment for nonpayment of fine was deleted. This change was also recommended by United States District Judge T. Blake Kennedy on the ground that, otherwise, section would be practically meaningless since, in most cases, offenders cannot pay a fine.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title.</p>
