<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 482 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the following language from section 712 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping, prohibiting flogging and corporal punishment: &ldquo;and any master or other officer thereof who shall violate the aforesaid provisions of this section, or either thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not less than three months nor more than two years.&rdquo; That language was the basis for the addition of the word &ldquo;flogs&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;any corporal or other&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;any.&rdquo; The punishment imposed by section 482 was adopted as that was the later statute as incorporated in 1909 Criminal Code.</p>
