<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 119, first and second paragraphs, of title 41 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts (July 1, 1944, ch. 358, &sect;19(a), 58 Stat. 667).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section was rewritten with changes of phraseology to conform to the style adopted in the revision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;records&rdquo; was omitted as surplusage in order to avoid any inference that &ldquo;records&rdquo; as used in other sections was intended to have a different or more limited connotation than the broad and commonly understood meaning popularly assigned to the term.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of Title 41, Public Contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;principal&rdquo; in section 2 of this title.</p>
