<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. The Constitution of the United States, Article III. Section 2, Paragraph 3, provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Amendment VI provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body-block">28 U.S.C. former &sect;114 (now &sect;&sect;1393, 1441) provides:</p>
<p class="note-body">All prosecutions for crimes or offenses shall be had within the division of such districts where the same were committed, unless the court, or the judge thereof, upon the application of the defendant, shall order the cause to be transferred for prosecution to another division of the district.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:80 --><p class="note-body-block">The word &ldquo;prosecutions,&rdquo; as used in this statute, does not include the finding and return of an indictment. The prevailing practice of impaneling a grand jury for the entire district at a session in some division and of distributing the indictments among the divisions in which the offenses were committed is deemed proper and legal, <em>Salinger v. Loisel</em>, 265 U.S. 224, 237. The court stated that this practice is &ldquo;attended with real advantages.&rdquo; The rule is a restatement of existing law and is intended to sanction the continuance of this practice. For this reason, the rule requires that only the trial be held in the division in which the offense was committed and permits other proceedings to be had elsewhere in the same district.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Within the framework of the foregoing constitutional provisions and the provisions of the general statute, 28 U.S.C. 114 [now 1393, 1441], <em>supra</em>, numerous statutes have been enacted to regulate the venue of criminal proceedings, particularly in respect to continuing offenses and offenses consisting of several transactions occurring in different districts. <em>Armour Packing Co. v. United States</em>, 209 U.S. 56, 73&ndash;77; <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 323 U.S. 273. These special venue provisions are not affected by the rule. Among these statutes are the following:</p>

<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment eliminates the requirement that the prosecution shall be in a division in which the offense was committed and vests discretion in the court to fix the place of trial at any place within the district with due regard to the convenience of the defendant and his witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Sixth Amendment provides that the defendant shall have the right to a trial &ldquo;by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; There is no constitutional right to trial within a division. See <em>United States v. Anderson</em>, 328 U.S. 699, 704, 705 (1946); <em>Barrett v. United States</em>, 169 U.S. 218 (1898); <em>Lafoon v. United States</em>, 250 F.2d 958 (5th Cir. 1958); <em>Carrillo v. Squier</em>, 137 F.2d 648 (9th Cir. 1943); <em>McNealey v. Johnston</em>, 100 F.2d 280, 282 (9th Cir. 1938). Cf. <em>Platt v. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co</em>., 376 U.S. 240 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">The former requirement for venue within the division operated in an irrational fashion. Divisions have been created in only half of the districts, and the differentiation between those districts with and those without divisions often bears no relationship to comparative size or population. In many districts a single judge is required to sit in several divisions and only brief and infrequent terms may be held in particular divisions. As a consequence under the original rule there was often undue delay in the disposition of criminal cases&mdash;delay which was particularly serious with respect to defendants who had been unable to secure release on bail pending the holding of the next term of court.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court is satisfied that there exists in the place fixed for trial prejudice against the defendant so great as to render the trial unfair, the court may, of course, fix another place of trial within the district (if there be <!-- PDFPage:81 -->such) where such prejudice does not exist. Cf. Rule 21 dealing with transfers between districts.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment is intended to eliminate an inconsistency between rule 18, which in its present form has been interpreted not to allow trial in a division other than that in which the offense was committed except as dictated by the convenience of the defendant and witnesses, <em>Dupoint v. United States</em>, 388 F.2d 39 (5th Cir. 1968), and the Speedy Trial Act of 1974. This Act provides:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">In any case involving a defendant charged with an offense, the appropriate judicial officer, at the earliest practicable time, shall, after consultation with the counsel for the defendant and the attorney for the Government, set the case for trial on a day certain, or list it for trial on a weekly or other short-term trial calendar at a place within the judicial district so as to assure a speedy trial.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">18 U.S.C. &sect;3161(a). This provision is intended to &ldquo;permit the trial of a case at any place within the judicial district. This language was included in anticipation of problems which might occur in districts with statutory divisions, where it could be difficult to set trial outside the division.&rdquo; H.R.Rep. No. 93&ndash;1508, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1974).</p>
<p class="note-body">The change does not offend the venue or vicinage provisions of the Constitution. Article III, &sect;2, clause 3 places venue (the geographical location of the trial) &ldquo;in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed,&rdquo; while the Sixth Amendment defines the vicinage (the geographical location of the jurors) as &ldquo;the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.&rdquo; The latter provision makes &ldquo;no reference to a division within a judicial district.&rdquo; <em>United States v. James</em>, 528 F.2d 999 (5th Cir. 1976). &ldquo;It follows a fortiori that when a district is not separated into divisions,&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* trial at any place within the district is allowable under the Sixth Amendment&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Fernandez</em>, 480 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1973). See also <em>Zicarelli v. Gray</em>, 543 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1976) and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nor is the change inconsistent with the Declaration of Policy in the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, which reads:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">It is the policy of the United States that all litigants in Federal courts entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">28 U.S.C. &sect;1861. This language does not mean that the Act requires &ldquo;the trial court to convene not only in the district but also in the division wherein the offense occurred,&rdquo; as:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">There is no hint in the statutory history that the Jury Selection Act was intended to do more than provide improved judicial machinery so that grand and petit jurors would be selected at random by the use of objective qualification criteria to ensure a representative cross section of the district or division in which the grand or petit jury sits. <em>United States v. Cates</em>, 485 F.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to rule 18 does not eliminate either of the existing considerations which bear upon fixing the place of trial within a district, but simply adds yet another consideration in the interest of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974. The amendment does not authorize the fixing of the place of trial for yet other reasons. Cf. <em>United States v. Fernandez</em>, 480 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 1973) (court in the exercise of its supervisory power held improper the fixing of the place of trial &ldquo;for no apparent reason other than the convenience of the judge&rdquo;).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Indictment or Information Pending</cap-smallcap>. A defendant arrested, held, or present in a district other than that in which an indictment or information is pending against that defendant may state in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere, to waive trial in the district in which the indictment or information is pending, and to consent to disposition of the case in the district in which that defendant was arrested, held, or present, subject to the approval of the United States attorney for each district. Upon receipt of the defendant's statement and of the written approval of the United States attorneys, the clerk of the court in which the indictment or information is pending shall transmit the papers in the proceeding or certified copies thereof to the clerk of the court for the district in which the defendant is arrested, held, or present, and the prosecution shall continue in that district.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Indictment or Information Not Pending</cap-smallcap>. A defendant arrested, held, or present, in a district other than the district in which a complaint is pending against that defendant may state in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere, to waive venue and trial in the district in which the warrant was issued, and to consent to disposition of the case in the district in which that defendant was arrested, held, or present, subject to the approval of the United States attorney for each district.

The consent shall be given in writing before the court but only after the court has apprised the juvenile of the juvenile's rights, including the right to be returned to the district in which the juvenile is alleged to have committed the act, and of the consequences of such consent.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule introduces a new procedure in the interest of defendants who intend to plead guilty and are arrested in a district other than that in which the prosecution has been instituted. This rule would accord to a defendant in such a situation an opportunity to secure a disposition of the case in the district where the arrest takes place, thereby relieving him of whatever hardship may be involved in a removal to the place where the prosecution is pending. In order to prevent possible interference with the administration of justice, however, the consent of the United States attorneys involved is required.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 20 has proved to be most useful. In some districts, however, literal compliance with the procedures spelled out by the rule has resulted in unnecessary delay in the disposition of cases. This delay has been particularly troublesome where the defendant has been arrested prior to the filing of an indictment or information against him. See e.g., the procedure described in <em>Donovan v. United States</em>, 205 F.2d 557 (10th Cir. 1953). Furthermore, the benefit of the rule has not been available to juveniles electing to be proceeded against under 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;5031&ndash;5037. In an attempt to clarify and simplify the procedure the rule has been recast into four subdivisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;This subdivision is intended to apply to the situation in which an indictment or information is pending at the time at which the defendant indicates his desire to have the transfer made. Two amendments are made to the present language of the rule. In the first sentence the words &ldquo;or held&rdquo; and &ldquo;or is held&rdquo; are added to make it clear that a person already in state or federal custody within a district may request a transfer of federal charges pending against him in another district. See 4 Barron, Federal Practice and Procedure 146 (1951). The words &ldquo;after receiving a copy of the indictment or information&rdquo; are deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The defendant should be permitted, if he wishes, to initiate transfer proceedings under the Rule without waiting for a copy of the indictment or information to be obtained. The defendant is protected against prejudice by the fact that under subdivision (c) he can, in effect, rescind his action by pleading not guilty after the transfer has been completed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;This subdivision is intended to apply to the situation in which no indictment or information is pending but the defendant has been arrested on a warrant issued upon a complaint in another district. Under the procedure set out he may initiate the transfer proceedings without waiting for the filing of an indictment or information in the district where the complaint is pending. Also it is made clear that the defendant may validate an information previously filed by waiving indictment in open court when he is brought before the court to plead. See <em>United States v. East</em>, 5 F.R.D. 389. (N.D. Ind. 1946); <em>Potter v. United States</em>, 36 F.R.D. 394 (W.D. Mo. 1965). Here again the defendant is fully protected by the fact that at the time of pleading in the transferee court he may then refuse to waive indictment and rescind the transfer by pleading not guilty.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c).&mdash;The last two sentences of the original rule are included here. The last sentence is amended to forbid use against the defendant of his statement that he wishes to plead guilty or nolo contendere whether or not he was represented by counsel when it was made. Since under the amended rule the defendant may make his statement prior to receiving a copy of the indictment or information, it would be unfair to permit use of that statement against him.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d).&mdash;Under 18 U.S.C. &sect;5033 a juvenile who has committed an act in violation of the law of the United States in one district and is apprehended in another must be returned to the district &ldquo;having cognizance of the alleged violation&rdquo; before he can consent to being proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent. This subdivision will permit a juvenile after he has been advised by counsel and with the approval of the court and the United States attorney to consent to be proceeded against in the district in which he is arrested or held. Consent is required only of the United States attorney in the district of the arrest in order to permit expeditious handling of juvenile cases. If it is necessary to recognize special interests of particular districts where offenses are committed&mdash;e.g., the District of Columbia with its separate Juvenile Court (District of Columbia Code &sect;11&ndash;1551(a))&mdash;the Attorney General may do so through his Administrative control over United States Attorneys.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e).&mdash;This subdivision is added to make it clear that a defendant who appears in one district in response to a summons issued in the district where the offense was committed may initiate transfer proceedings under the rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 20 is amended to provide that a person &ldquo;present&rdquo; in a district other than the district in which he is charged with a criminal offense may, subject to the other provisions of rule 20, plead guilty in the district in which he is &ldquo;present.&rdquo; See rule 6(b), Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before Magistrates.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the former rule, practice was to have the district in which the offense occurred issue a bench warrant authorizing the arrest of the defendant in the district in which he was located. This is a procedural complication which serves no interest of either the government or the defense and therefore can properly be dispensed with.</p>
<p class="note-body">Making the fact that a defendant is &ldquo;present&rdquo; in the district an adequate basis for allowing him to plead guilty there makes it unnecessary to retain subdivision (e) which makes appearance in response to a summons equivalent to an arrest. Dropping (e) will eliminate some minor ambiguity created by that subdivision. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;322 n. 26, p. 612 (1969, Supp. 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">There are practical advantages which will follow from the change. In practice a person may turn himself in in a district other than that in which the prosecution is pending. It may be more convenient to have him plead in the district in which he is present rather than having him or the government incur the expense of his return to the district in which the charge is pending.</p>
<p class="note-body">The danger of &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo; can be controlled by the requirement that both United States Attorneys agree to the handling of the case under provisions of this rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with transferring a defendant from one district to another for the purpose of pleading and being sentenced. It deals with the situation where a defendant is located in one district (A) and is charged with a crime in another district (B). Under the present rule, if such a defendant desires to waive trial and plead guilty or nolo contendere, a judge in district B would issue a bench warrant for the defendant, authorizing his arrest in district A and his transport to district B for the purpose of pleading and being sentenced.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court amendments permit the defendant in the above example to plead guilty or nolo contendere in district A, if the United States Attorneys for districts A and B consent.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee has added a conforming amendment to subdivision (d), which estab<!-- PDFPage:83 -->lishes procedures for dealing with defendants who are juveniles.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment to subdivision (b) is intended to expedite transfer proceedings under Rule 20. At present, considerable delay&mdash;sometimes as long as three or four weeks&mdash;occurs in subdivision (b) cases, that is, where no indictment or information is pending. This time is spent on the transmittal of defendant's statement to the district where the complaint is pending, the filing of an information or return of an indictment there, and the transmittal of papers in the case from that district to the district where the defendant is present. Under the amendment, the defendant, by also waiving venue, would make it possible for charges to be filed in the district of his arrest or presence. This would advance the interests of both the prosecution and defendant in a timely entry of a plea of guilty. No change has been made in the requirement that the transfer occur with the consent of both United States attorneys.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions</em> (a) and (b). 1. This rule introduces an addition to existing law. &ldquo;Lawyers not thoroughly familiar with Federal practice are somewhat astounded to learn that they may not move for a change of venue, even if they are able to demonstrate that public feeling in the vicinity of the crime may render impossible a fair and impartial trial. This seems to be a defect in the federal law, which the proposed rules would cure.&rdquo; Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 655; Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule provides for two kinds of motions that may be made by the defendant for a change of venue. The first is a motion on the ground that so great a prejudice exists against the defendant that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in the district or division where the case is pending. Express provisions to a similar effect are found in many State statutes. See, e.g., Ala. Code (1940), Title 15, sec. 267; Cal.Pen.Code (Deering, 1941), sec. 1033; Conn.Gen.Stat. (1930), sec. 6445; Mass.Gen.Laws (1932) c. 277, sec. 51 (in capital cases); N.Y. Code of Criminal Procedure, sec. 344. The second is a motion for a change of venue in cases involving an offense alleged to have been committed in more than one district or division. In such cases the court, on defendant's motion, will be authorized to transfer the case to another district or division in which the commission of the offense is charged, if the court is satisfied that it is in the interest of justice to do so. The effect of this provision would be to modify the existing practice under which in such cases the Government has the final choice of the jurisdiction where the prosecution should be conducted. The matter will now be left in the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The rule provides for a change of venue only on defendant's motion and does not extend the same right to the prosecution, since the defendant has a constitutional right to a trial in the district where the offense was committed. Constitution of the United States, Article III, Sec. 2, Par. 3; Amendment VI. By making a motion for a change of venue, however, the defendant waives this constitutional right.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. This rule is in addition to and does not supersede existing statutes enabling a party to secure a change of judge on the ground of personal bias or prejudice, 28 U.S.C. 25 [now 144]; or enabling the defendant to secure a change of venue as of right in certain cases involving offenses committed in more than one district, 18 U.S.C. 338a(d) [now 876, 3239] (Mailing threatening communications); <em>Id</em>. sec. 403d(d) [now 875, 3239] (Threatening communications in interstate commerce).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). Cf. 28 U.S.C. 114 [now 1393, 1441] and Rule 20, <em>supra.</em></p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;All references to divisions are eliminated in accordance with the amendment to Rule 18 eliminating division venue. The defendant is given the right to a transfer only when he can show that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial at any place fixed by law for holding court in the district. Transfers within the district to avoid prejudice will be within the power of the judge to fix the place of trial as provided in the amendments to Rule 18. It is also made clear that on a motion to transfer under this subdivision the court may select the district to which the transfer may be made. Cf. <em>United States v. Parr</em>, 17 F.R.D. 512, 519 (S.D.Tex. (1955); <em>Parr v. United States</em>, 351 U.S. 513 (1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;The original rule limited change of venue for reasons other than prejudice in the district to those cases where venue existed in more than one district. Upon occasion, however, convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interest of justice would best be served by trial in a district in which no part of the offense was committed. See, e.g., <em>Travis v. United States</em>, 364 U.S. 631 (1961), holding that the only venue of a charge of making or filing a false non-Communist affidavit required by &sect;9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act is in Washington, D.C. even though all the relevant witnesses may be located at the place where the affidavit was executed and mailed. See also Barber, Venue in Federal Criminal Cases: A Plea for Return to Principle, 42 Tex.L.Rev. 39 (1963); Wright, Proposed Changes in Federal Civil, Criminal and Appellate Procedure, 35 F.R.D. 317, 329 (1964). The amendment permits a transfer in any case on motion of the defendant on a showing that it would be for the convenience of parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice. Cf. 28 U.S.C. <!-- PDFPage:84 -->&sect;1404(a), stating a similar standard for civil cases. See also <em>Platt v. Minnesota Min. & Mfg. Co</em>., 376 U.S.C. 240 (1964). Here, as in subdivision (a), the court may select the district to which the transfer is to be made. The amendment also makes it clear that the court may transfer all or part of the offenses charged in a multi-count indictment or information. Cf. <em>United States v. Choate</em>, 276 F.2d 724 (5th Cir. 1960). References to divisions are eliminated in accordance with the amendment to Rule 18.</p>
