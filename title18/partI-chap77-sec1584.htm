<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;423, 446 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;&sect;248, 271, 35 Stat. 1139, 1142).</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections consolidated with changes of phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;principal&rdquo; in section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Provisions as to holding of kidnapped persons were omitted as superseded by section 1201 of this title and original text relating to sale or holding to involuntary servitude retained.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:377 --><p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;within the United States&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;within the jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo;. (See section 5 of this title defining &ldquo;United States&rdquo;.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provisions were derived from section 446 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as more consistent with other sections of this chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement of section 423 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of one-half the fine &ldquo;for the use of the person prosecuting the indictment to effect&rdquo; was omitted as meaningless. (See also reviser's note under section 1585 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory-punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
