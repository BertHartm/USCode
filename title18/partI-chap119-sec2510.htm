<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 801 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;351 provided that: &ldquo;On the basis of its own investigations and of published studies, the Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) Wire communications are normally conducted through the use of facilities which form part of an interstate network. The same facilities are used for interstate and intrastate communications. There has been extensive wiretapping carried on without legal sanctions, and without the consent of any of the parties to the conversation. Electronic, mechanical, and other intercepting devices are being used to overhear oral conversations made in private, without the consent of any of the parties to such communications. The contents of these communications and evidence derived therefrom are being used by public and private parties as evidence in court and administrative proceedings, and by persons whose activities affect interstate commerce. The possession, manufacture, distribution, ad<!-- PDFPage:491 -->vertising, and use of these devices are facilitated by interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) In order to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral communications, to protect the integrity of court and administrative proceedings, and to prevent the obstruction of interstate commerce, it is necessary for Congress to define on a uniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized, to prohibit any unauthorized interception of such communications, and the use of the contents thereof in evidence in courts and administrative proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) Organized criminals make extensive use of wire and oral communications in their criminal activities. The interception of such communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) To safeguard the privacy of innocent persons, the interception of wire or oral communications where none of the parties to the communication has consented to the interception should be allowed only when authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction and should remain under the control and supervision of the authorizing court. Interception of wire and oral communications should further be limited to certain major types of offenses and specific categories of crime with assurances that the interception is justified and that the information obtained thereby will not be misused.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">National Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 804 of Pub. L. 90&ndash;351, as amended by Pub. L. 91&ndash;452, title XII, &sect;1212, Oct. 15, 1970, 84 Stat. 961; Pub.
