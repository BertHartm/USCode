<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;399 (June 25, 1910, ch. 395, &sect;3, 36 Stat. 825).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;deemed guilty of a felony&rdquo; were deleted as unnecessary in view of definition of felony in section 1 of this title. (See reviser's note under section 550 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and on conviction thereof shall be&rdquo; were deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>

<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;Possession of the United States&rdquo; were inserted twice. (See reviser's note under section 2421 of this title.)</p>
