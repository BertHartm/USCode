<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;452, 454, 567 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;&sect;273, 275, 330, 35 Stat. 1143, 1152).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates the punishment provision of sections 454 and 567 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 452 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision of said section 454 for the death penalty for first degree murder was consolidated with section 567 of said title 18, by adding the words &ldquo;unless the jury qualifies its verdict by adding thereto &lsquo;without capital punishment&rsquo; in which event he shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment for second degree murder was changed and the phrase &ldquo;for any term of years or for life&rdquo; was substituted for the words &ldquo;not less than ten years and may be imprisoned for life&rdquo;. This change conforms to a uniform policy of omitting the minimum punishment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 567 was not included in section 2031 of this title since the rewritten punishment provision for rape removes the necessity for a qualified verdict.</p>
<p class="note-body">The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction provision was added in view of definitive section 7 of this title.</p>
