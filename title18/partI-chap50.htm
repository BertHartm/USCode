Section 4 of such act, which provided that nothing in such act &ldquo;shall be held to take away or impair the jurisdiction of the courts of the several States under the laws thereof, or to preclude action, otherwise valid, by any State or Territory with respect to the navigable waters within the boundaries of such State or Territory&rdquo;, was omitted as surplusage and unnecessary.</p>
