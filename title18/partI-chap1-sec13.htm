<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whoever within or upon any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 7 of this title, is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.    </p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes    </h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;468 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;289, 35 Stat. 1145; June 15, 1933, ch. 85, 48 Stat. 152; June 20, 1935, ch. 284, 49 Stat. 394; June 6, 1940, ch. 241, 54 Stat. 234).    </p>
<p class="note-body">Act March 4, 1909, &sect;289 used the words &ldquo;now in force&rdquo; when referring to the laws of any State, organized Territory or district, to be considered in force.    </p>
<p class="note-body">As amended on June 15, 1933, the words &ldquo;by the laws thereof in force on June 1, 1933, and remaining in force at the time of the doing or omitting the doing of such act or thing, would be penal,&rdquo; were used.    </p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of June 20, 1935, extended the date to &ldquo;April 1, 1935,&rdquo; and the amendment of June 6, 1940, extended the date to &ldquo;February 1, 1940&rdquo;.    </p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section omits the specification of any date as unnecessary in a revision, which speaks from the date of its enactment. Such omission will not only make effective within Federal reservations, the local State laws in force on the date of the enactment of the revision, but will authorize the Federal courts to apply the same measuring stick to such offenses as is applied in the adjoining State under future changes of the State law and will make unnecessary periodic pro forma amendments of this section to keep abreast of changes of local laws. In other words, the revised section makes applicable to offenses committed on such reservations, the law of the place that would govern if the reservation had not been ceded to the United States.    </p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;Possession&rdquo; was inserted to clarify scope of section.    </p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.    </p>
