<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3663. Order of restitution</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under this title, section 401, 408(a), 409, 416, 420, or 422(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 848(a), 849, 856, 861, 863) (but in no case shall a participant in an offense under such sections be considered a victim of such offense under this section), or section 46312, 46502, or 46504 of title 49, other than an offense described in section 3663A(c), may order, in addition to or, in the case of a misdemeanor, in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense, or if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate. The court may also order, if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement, restitution to persons other than the victim of the offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The court, in determining whether to order restitution under this section, shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) To the extent that the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution under this section outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims, the court may decline to make such an order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;victim&rdquo; means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. In the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the victim or representative of the victim's estate, another family member, or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the victim's rights under this section, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such representative or guardian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The court may also order restitution in any criminal case to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The order may require that such defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:662 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if return of the property under subparagraph (A) is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value of the property on the date of sentencing,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">less the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury to a victim including an offense under chapter 109A or chapter 110&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the place of treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reimburse the victim for income lost by such victim as a result of such offense;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury also results in the death of a victim, pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary funeral and related services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in any case, reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses related to participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in any case, if the victim (or if the victim is deceased, the victim's estate) consents, make restitution in services in lieu of money, or make restitution to a person or organization designated by the victim or the estate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (but subject to the provisions of subsections (a)(1)(B)(i)(II) and (ii),<sup><a href="#3663_1_target" name="3663_1">1</a></sup> when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in section 401, 408(a), 409, 416, 420, or 422(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 848(a), 849, 856, 861, 863), in which there is no identifiable victim, the court may order that the defendant make restitution in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An order of restitution under this subsection shall be based on the amount of public harm caused by the offense, as determined by the court in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In no case shall the amount of restitution ordered under this subsection exceed the amount of the fine ordered for the offense charged in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Restitution under this subsection shall be distributed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 65 percent of the total amount of restitution shall be paid to the State entity designated to administer crime victim assistance in the State in which the crime occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 35 percent of the total amount of restitution shall be paid to the State entity designated to receive Federal substance abuse block grant funds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The court shall not make an award under this subsection if it appears likely that such award would interfere with a forfeiture under chapter 46 or chapter 96 of this title or under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding section 3612(c) or any other provision of law, a penalty assessment under section 3013 or a fine under subchapter C of chapter 227 shall take precedence over an order of restitution under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Requests for community restitution under this subsection may be considered in all plea agreements negotiated by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The United States Sentencing Commission shall promulgate guidelines to assist courts in determining the amount of restitution that may be ordered under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No restitution shall be ordered under this subsection until such time as the Sentencing Commission promulgates guidelines pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An order of restitution made pursuant to this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection (c), the court shall order, in addition to, or in the case of a misdemeanor, in addition to or in lieu of, any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;victim&rdquo; means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. In the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the victim or representative of the victim's estate, another family member, or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the victim's rights under this section, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such representative or guardian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The court shall also order, if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement, restitution to persons other than the victim of the offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The order of restitution shall require that such defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if return of the property under subparagraph (A) is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the value of the property on the date of sentencing, less</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury to a victim&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the place of treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reimburse the victim for income lost by such victim as a result of such offense;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury that results in the death of the victim, pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary funeral and related services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in any case, reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) This section shall apply in all sentencing proceedings for convictions of, or plea agreements relating to charges for, any offense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a crime of violence, as defined in section 16;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an offense against property under this title, including any offense committed by fraud or deceit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) an offense described in section 1365 (relating to tampering with consumer products); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in which an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a plea agreement that does not result in a conviction for an offense described in paragraph (1), this section shall apply only if the plea specifically states that an offense listed under such paragraph gave rise to the plea agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section shall not apply in the case of an offense described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) if the court finds, from facts on the record, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determining complex issues of fact related to the cause or amount of the victim's losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) An order of restitution under this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3664. Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of restitution</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For orders of restitution under this title, the court shall order the probation officer to obtain and include in its presentence report, or in a separate report, as the court may direct, information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in fashioning a restitution order. The report shall include, to the extent practicable, a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant. If the number or identity of victims cannot be reasonably ascertained, or other circumstances exist that make this requirement clearly impracticable, the probation officer shall so inform the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The court shall disclose to both the defendant and the attorney for the Government all portions of the presentence or other report pertaining to the matters described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this chapter, chapter 227, and Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall be the only rules applicable to proceedings under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Upon the request of the probation officer, but not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing, the attorney for the Government, after consulting, to the extent practicable, with all identified victims, shall promptly provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The probation officer shall, prior to submitting the presentence report under subsection (a), to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide notice to all identified victims of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the offense or offenses of which the defendant was convicted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amounts subject to restitution submitted to the probation officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the opportunity of the victim to submit information to the probation officer concerning the amount of the victim's losses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the scheduled date, time, and place of the sentencing hearing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the availability of a lien in favor of the victim pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) the opportunity of the victim to file with the probation officer a separate affidavit relating to the amount of the victim's losses subject to restitution; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide the victim with an affidavit form to submit pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each defendant shall prepare and file with the probation officer an affidavit fully describing the financial resources of the defendant, including a complete listing of all assets owned or controlled by the defendant as of the date on which the defendant was arrested, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other information that the court requires relating to such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) After reviewing the report of the probation officer, the court may require additional documentation or hear testimony. The privacy of any records filed, or testimony heard, pursuant to this section shall be maintained to the greatest extent possible, and such records may be filed or testimony heard in camera.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If the victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order. Such order may be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to include such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The court may refer any issue arising in connection with a proposed order of restitution to a magistrate judge or special master for proposed findings of fact and recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo determination of the issue by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence. The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for the Government. The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant's dependents, shall be on the defendant. The burden of demonstrating such other matters as the court deems appropriate shall be upon the party designated by the court as justice requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1)(A) In each order of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In no case shall the fact that a victim has received or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source be considered in determining the amount of restitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon determination of the amount of restitution owed to each victim, the court shall, pursuant to section 3572, specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid, in consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the financial resources and other assets of the defendant, including whether any of these assets are jointly controlled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) projected earnings and other income of the defendant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any financial obligations of the defendant; including obligations to dependents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified intervals and in-kind payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make nominal periodic payments if the court finds from facts on the record that the economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow the payment of any amount of a restitu<!-- PDFPage:666 -->tion order, and do not allow for the payment of the full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any reasonable schedule of payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An in-kind payment described in paragraph (3) may be in the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) return of property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) replacement of property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the victim agrees, services rendered to the victim or a person or organization other than the victim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) No victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A victim may at any time assign the victim's interest in restitution payments to the Crime Victims Fund in the Treasury without in any way impairing the obligation of the defendant to make such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) If the court finds that more than 1 defendant has contributed to the loss of a victim, the court may make each defendant liable for payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim's loss and economic circumstances of each defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) If the court finds that more than 1 victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by a defendant, the court may provide for a different payment schedule for each victim based on the type and amount of each victim's loss and accounting for the economic circumstances of each victim. In any case in which the United States is a victim, the court shall ensure that all other victims receive full restitution before the United States receives any restitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) If a victim has received compensation from insurance or any other source with respect to a loss, the court shall order that restitution be paid to the person who provided or is obligated to provide the compensation, but the restitution order shall provide that all restitution of victims required by the order be paid to the victims before any restitution is paid to such a provider of compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by the law of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) A restitution order shall provide that the defendant shall notify the court and the Attorney General of any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay restitution. The court may also accept notification of a material change in the defendant's economic circumstances from the United States or from the victim. The Attorney General shall certify to the court that the victim or victims owed restitution by the defendant have been notified of the change in circumstances. Upon receipt of the notification, the court may, on its own motion, or the motion of any party, including the victim, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) A conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to an order of restitution shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, to the extent consistent with State law, brought by the victim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1)(A)(i) An order of restitution may be enforced by the United States in the manner provided for in subchapter C of chapter 227 and subchapter B of chapter 229 of this title; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Jurisdiction of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, in any proceeding in court for the forfeiture, under the internal-revenue laws, of any vehicle or aircraft seized for a violation of the internal-revenue laws relating to liquors, such forfeiture is decreed, the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to remit or mitigate the forfeiture.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions precedent to remission or mitigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any such proceeding the court shall not allow the claim of any claimant for remission or <!-- PDFPage:668 -->mitigation unless and until he proves (1) that he has an interest in such vehicle or aircraft, as owner or otherwise, which he acquired in good faith, (2) that he had at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that it was being or would be used in the violation of laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor, and (3) if it appears that the interest asserted by the claimant arises out of or is in any way subject to any contract or agreement under which any person having a record or reputation for violating laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor has a right with respect to such vehicle or aircraft, that, before such claimant acquired his interest, or such other person acquired his right under such contract or agreement, whichever occurred later, the claimant, his officer or agent, was informed in answer to his inquiry, at the headquarters of the sheriff, chief of police, principal Federal internal-revenue officer engaged in the enforcement of the liquor laws, or other principal local or Federal law-enforcement officer of the locality in which such other person acquired his right under such contract or agreement, of the locality in which such other person then resided, and of each locality in which the claimant has made any other inquiry as to the character or financial standing of such other person, that such other person had no such record or reputation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Claimants first entitled to delivery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the request of any claimant whose claim for remission or mitigation is allowed and whose interest is first in the order of priority among such claims allowed in such proceeding and is of an amount in excess of, or equal to, the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft, the court shall order its return to him; and, upon the joint request of any two or more claimants whose claims are allowed and whose interests are not subject to any prior or intervening interests claimed and allowed in such proceedings, and are of a total amount in excess of, or equal to, the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft, the court shall order its return to such of the joint requesting claimants as is designated in such request. Such return shall be made only upon payment of all expenses incident to the seizure and forfeiture incurred by the United States. In all other cases the court shall order disposition of such vehicle or aircraft as provided in sections 304f&ndash;304m of Title 40, and if such disposition be by public sale, payment from the proceeds thereof, after satisfaction of all such expenses, of any such claim in its order of priority among the claims allowed in such proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Delivery on bond pending trial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding in court for the forfeiture under the internal-revenue laws of any vehicle or aircraft seized for a violation of the internal-revenue laws relating to liquor, the court shall order delivery thereof to any claimant who shall establish his right to the immediate possession thereof, and shall execute, with one or more sureties approved by the court, and deliver to the court, a bond to the United States for the payment of a sum equal to the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft. Such bond shall be conditioned to return such vehicle or aircraft at the time of the trial and to pay the difference between the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft as of the time it shall have been so released on bond and the appraised value thereof as of the time of trial; and conditioned further that, if the vehicle or aircraft be not returned at the time of trial, the bond shall stand in lieu of, and be forfeited in the same manner as, such vehicle or aircraft. Notwithstanding this subsection or any other provisions of law relating to the delivery of possession on bond of vehicles or aircraft sought to be forfeited under the internal-revenue laws, the court may, in its discretion and upon good cause shown by the United States, refuse to order such delivery of possession.</p>
