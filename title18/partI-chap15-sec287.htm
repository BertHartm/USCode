<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;80 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;35, 35 Stat. 1095; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 80 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was divided into two parts. That portion making it a crime to present false claims was retained as this section. The part relating to false statements is now section 1001 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">To clarify meaning of &ldquo;department&rdquo; words &ldquo;agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;or agency&rdquo; were inserted after it. (See definitions of &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder&rdquo; which appeared in two places were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;five years&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;ten years&rdquo; to harmonize the punishment provisions of comparable sections involving offenses of the gravity of felonies, but not of such heinous character as to warrant a 10-year punishment. (See sections 914, 1001, 1002, 1005, 1006 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;principal&rdquo; in section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in phraseology were made.</p>
