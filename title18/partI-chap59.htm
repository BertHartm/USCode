<p class="note-body">Section consolidates subsection (a) of section 222 with section 223, of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or 3.2 per centum of alcohol by weight&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;volume.&rdquo; Such words conform with <em>Flippin v. U.S</em>. (1941, 121 F. 2d 742, 744, certiorari denied, 62 S. Ct. 184, 314 U.S. 677, 86 L. Ed. 542); <em>Robason v. U.S</em>. (1941, 122 F. 2d 991); <em>Dolloff v. U.S</em>.

<p class="note-body">Those cases overruled <em>Arnold v. U.S</em>. (1940, 115 F. 2d 523) and Gregg v. U.S. (1940, 116 F. 2d 609) and established that preservation of the congressional intent which requires addition of the inserted language.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of section 223 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed., has been reworded to apply the definition of intoxicating liquor contained in the laws of the respective States to this section only, in accordance with administrative interpretation. Said section 223 was derived from section 3 of the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936 (Act June 25, 1936, ch. 815, 49 Stat. 1928), which was enacted for the protection of dry States. As originally enacted, its provisions relating to such definition also embraced the interstate commerce liquor laws from which sections 1263&ndash;1265 of this title were derived. In the enforcement of the latter, however, their own definitions have been applied and not the definitions of the States into which or through which the liquor was shipped.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;Territory, District, or Possession&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;State&rdquo;, to conform with the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; given in said section 222 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such section, including subsection (b) thereof, is also incorporated in section 3615 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall&rdquo; were omitted in view of definitive section 1 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision that &ldquo;such liquor shall be forfeited to the United States&rdquo; was omitted as covered by section 3615 of this title, which was derived from section 224 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Intoxicating Liquors.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision that such liquor &ldquo;may be seized and condemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law&rdquo; was likewise omitted as covered by section 3615 of this title, which <!-- PDFPage:315 -->provides for seizure and forfeiture under the internal revenue laws rather than under provisions of law &ldquo;for the seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law&rdquo; or, in other words, rather than under the customs laws. Section 224 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Intoxicating Liquors, on which said section 3615 of this title is based, was derived from the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936 (Act June 25, 1936, ch. 815, 49 Stat. 1928). Said section 224 included, in its coverage, section 390 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., on which this revised section is based, even though the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936, in another section thereof, in amending said section 390, retained the provision that seizures and forfeitures thereunder should be under the customs laws. By eliminating this conflicting provision, a uniform procedure for seizures and forfeitures, under the internal revenue laws, is established under said section 3615 of this title.</p>
