<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. This rule is a formulation of the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury, Constitu<!-- PDFPage:97 -->tion of the United States, Article III, Sec. 2, Par. 3: &ldquo;The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo;; Amendment VI: &ldquo;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; The right to a jury trial, however, does not apply to petty offenses, <em>District of Columbia v. Clawans</em>, 300 U.S. 617; <em>Schick v. United States</em>, 195 U.S. 65; Frankfurter and Corcoran, 39 Harv.L.R. 917. Cf. Rule 38(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The provision for a waiver of jury trial by the defendant embodies existing practice, the constitutionality of which has been upheld, <em>Patton v. United States</em>, 281 U.S. 276; <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann</em>, 317 U.S. 269; Cf. Rules 38 and 39 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. Many States by express statutory provision permit waiver of jury trial in criminal cases. See A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure Commentaries, pp. 807&ndash;811.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule would permit either a stipulation before the trial that the case be tried by a jury composed of less than 12 or a stipulation during the trial consenting that the case be submitted to less than 12 jurors. The second alternative is useful in case it becomes necessary during the trial to excuse a juror owing to illness or for some other cause and no alternate juror is available. The rule is a restatement of existing practice, the constitutionality of which was approved in <em>Patton v. United States</em>, 281 U.S. 276.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). This rule changes existing law in so far as it requires the court in a case tried without a jury to make special findings of fact if requested. Cf. Connecticut practice, under which a judge in a criminal case tried by the court without a jury makes findings of fact, <em>State v. Frost</em>, 105 Conn. 326.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment adds to the rule a provision added to Civil Rule 52(a) in 1946.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1977 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (b) makes it clear that the parties, with the approval of the court, may enter into an agreement to have the case decided by less than twelve jurors if one or more jurors are unable or disqualified to continue. For many years the Eastern District of Virginia has used a form entitled, &ldquo;Waiver of Alternate Jurors.&rdquo; In a substantial percentage of cases the form is signed by the defendant, his attorney, and the Assistant United States Attorney in advance of trial, generally on the morning of trial. It is handled automatically by the courtroom deputy clerk who, after completion, exhibits it to the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">This practice would seem to be authorized by existing rule 23(b), but there has been some doubt as to whether the pretrial stipulation is effective unless again agreed to by a defendant at the time a juror or jurors have to be excused. See 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;23.04 (2d. ed. Cipes, 1969); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;373 (1969). The proposed amendment is intended to make clear that the pretrial stipulation is an effective waiver, which need not be renewed at the time the incapacity or disqualification of the juror becomes known.</p>
<p class="note-body">In view of the fact that a defendant can make an effective pretrial waiver of trial by jury or by a jury of twelve, it would seem to follow that he can also effectively waive trial by a jury of twelve in situations where a juror or jurors cannot continue to serve.</p>
<p class="note-body">As has been the practice under rule 23(b), a stipulation addressed to the possibility that some jurors may later be excused need not be open-ended. That is, the stipulation may be conditioned upon the jury not being reduced below a certain size. See, e.g., <em>Williams v. United States</em>, 332 F.2d 36 (7th Cir. 1964) (agreement to proceed if no more than 2 jurors excused for illness); <em>Rogers v. United States</em>, 319 F.2d 5 (7th Cir. 1963) (same).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is changed to make clear the deadline for making a request for findings of fact and to provide that findings may be oral. The oral findings, of course, become a part of the record, as findings of fact are essential to proper appellate review on a conviction resulting from a nonjury trial. <em>United States v. Livingston</em>, 459 F.2d 797 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>
<p class="note-body">The meaning of current subdivision (c) has been in some doubt because there is no time specified within which a defendant must make a &ldquo;request&rdquo; that the court &ldquo;find the facts specially.&rdquo; See, e.g., <em>United States v. Rivera</em>, 444 F.2d 136 (2d Cir. 1971), where the request was not made until the sentence had been imposed. In the opinion the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">This situation might have raised the interesting and apparently undecided question of when a request for findings under Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(c) is too late, since Rivera's request was not made until the day after sentence was imposed. See generally <em>Benchwick v. United States</em>, 297 F.2d 330, 335 (9th Cir. 1961); <em>United States v. Morris</em>, 263 F.2d 594 (7th Cir. 1959).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 95&ndash;354; 1977 Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of section 2 of the bill simply approves the Supreme Court proposed changes in subdivisions (b) and (c) of rule 23 for the reasons given by the Advisory Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure to the Judicial Conference.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Approval of Proposed 1977 Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2(b) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;78 provided that: &ldquo;The amendments proposed by the Supreme Court [in its order of Apr. 26, 1977] to subdivisions (b) and (c) of rule 23 of such Rules of Criminal Procedure [subd. (b) and (c) of this rule] are approved.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). The amendment to subdivision (b) addresses a situation which does not occur with great frequency but which, when it does occur, may present a most difficult issue concerning the fair and efficient administration of justice. This situation is that in which, after the jury has retired to consider its verdict and any alternate jurors have been discharged, one of the jurors is seriously incapacitated or otherwise found to be unable to continue service upon the jury. The problem is acute when the trial has been a lengthy one and consequently the remedy of mistrial would necessitate a second expenditure of substantial prosecution, defense and court resources. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Meinster</em>, 484 F.Supp. 442 (S.D.Fla. 1980), aff'd sub nom. <em>United States v. Phillips</em>, 664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1981) (juror had heart attack during deliberations after &ldquo;well over four months of trial&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Barone</em>, 83 F.R.D. 565 (S.D. Fla. 1979) (juror removed upon recommendation of psychiatrist during deliberations after &ldquo;approximately six months of trial&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the judgment of the Committee that when a juror is lost during deliberations, especially in circumstances like those in <em>Barone</em> and <em>Meinster</em>, it is essential that there be available a course of action other than mistrial. Proceeding with the remaining 11 jurors, though heretofore impermissible under rule 23(b) absent stipulation by the parties and approval of the court, <em>United States v. Taylor</em>, 507 F.2d 166 (5th Cir. 1975), is constitutionally permissible. In <em>Williams v. Florida</em>, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Court concluded</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is an historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system and wholly without significance &ldquo;except to mystics.&rdquo; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* To read the Sixth Amendment as forever codifying a feature so incidental to the real purpose of the Amendment is to ascribe a blind formalism to the Framers which would require considerably <!-- PDFPage:98 -->more evidence than we have been able to discover in the history and language of the Constitution or in the reasoning of our past decisions. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Our holding does no more than leave these considerations to Congress and the States, unrestrained by an interpretation of the Sixth Amendment which would forever dictate the precise number which can constitute a jury.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>Williams</em> held that a six-person jury was constitutional because such a jury had the &ldquo;essential feature of a jury,&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common-sense judgment of a group of laymen, and in the community participation and shared responsibility which results from that group's determination of guilt or innocence,&rdquo; necessitating only a group &ldquo;large enough to promote group deliberation, free from outside attempts at intimidation, and to provide a fair possibility for obtaining a representative cross section of the community.&rdquo; This being the case, quite clearly the occasional use of a jury of slightly less than 12, as contemplated by the amendment to rule 23(b), is constitutional. Though the alignment of the Court and especially the separate opinion by Justice Powell in <em>Apodoca v. Oregon</em>, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), makes it at best uncertain whether less-than-unanimous verdicts would be constitutionally permissible in federal trials, it hardly follows that a requirement of unanimity of a group slightly less than 12 is similarly suspect.</p>
<p class="note-body">The <em>Meinster</em> case clearly reflects the need for a solution other than mistrial. There twelve defendants were named in a 36-count, 100-page indictment for RICO offenses and related violations, and the trial lasted more than four months. Before the jury retired for deliberations, the trial judge inquired of defense counsel whether they would now agree to a jury of less than 12 should a juror later be unable to continue during the deliberations which were anticipated to be lengthy. All defense counsel rejected that proposal. When one juror was excused a day later after suffering a heart attack, all defense counsel again rejected the proposal that deliberations continue with the remaining 11 jurors. Thus, the solution now provided in rule 23(b), stipulation to a jury of less than 12, was not possible in that case, just as it will not be possible in any case in which defense counsel believe some tactical advantage will be gained by retrial. Yet, to declare a mistrial at that point would have meant that over four months of trial time would have gone for naught and that a comparable period of time would have to be expended on retrial. For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the impact such a retrial would have upon that court's ability to comply with speedy trial limits in other cases, such a result is most undesirable.</p>
<p class="note-body">That being the case, it is certainly understandable that the trial judge in <em>Meinster</em> (as in <em>Barone</em>) elected to substitute an alternate juror at that point. Given the rule 23(b) bar on a verdict of less than 12 absent stipulation, <em>United States v. Taylor</em>, supra, such substitution seemed the least objectionable course of action. But in terms of what change in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be preferred in order to facilitate response to such situations in the future, the judgment of the Advisory Committee is that it is far better to permit the deliberations to continue with a jury of 11 than to make a substitution at that point.</p>
<p class="note-body">In rejecting the substitution-of-juror alternative, the Committee's judgment is in accord with that of most commentators and many courts.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">There have been proposals that the rule should be amended to permit an alternate to be substituted if a regular juror becomes unable to perform his duties after the case has been submitted to the jury. An early draft of the original Criminal Rules had contained such a provision, but it was withdrawn when the Supreme Court itself indicated to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules doubts as to the desirability and constitutionality of such a procedure. These doubts are as forceful now as they were a quarter century ago. To permit substitution of an alternate after deliberations have begun would require either that the alternate participate though he has missed part of the jury discussion, or that he sit in with the jury in every case on the chance he might be needed. Either course is subject to practical difficulty and to strong constitutional objection.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure</em>, &sect;388 (1969). See also Moore, <em>Federal Practice</em> par. 24.05 (2d ed. Cipes 1980) (&ldquo;The inherent coercive effect upon an alternate who joins a jury leaning heavily toward a guilty verdict may result in the alternate reaching a premature guilty verdict&rdquo;); 3 <em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice</em> &sect;15&ndash;2.7, commentary (2d ed. 1980) (&ldquo;It is not desirable to allow a juror who is unfamiliar with the prior deliberations to suddenly join the group and participate in the voting without the benefit of earlier group discussion&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Lamb</em>, 529 F.2d 1153 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>People v. Ryan</em>, 19 N.Y.2d 100, 224 N.E.2d 710 (1966). Compare <em>People v. Collins</em>, 17 Cal.3d 687, 131 Cal.Rptr. 782, 522 P.2d 742 (1976); <em>Johnson v. State</em>, 267 Ind. 256, 396 N.E.2d 623 (1977).</p>
<p class="note-body">The central difficulty with substitution, whether viewed only as a practical problem or a question of constitutional dimensions (procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment or jury trial under the Sixth Amendment), is that there does not appear to be any way to nullify the impact of what has occurred without the participation of the new juror. Even were it required that the jury &ldquo;review&rdquo; with the new juror their prior deliberations or that the jury upon substitution start deliberations anew, it still seems likely that the continuing jurors would be influenced by the earlier deliberations and that the new juror would be somewhat intimidated by the others by virtue of being a newcomer to the deliberations. As for the possibility of sending in the alternates at the very beginning with instructions to listen but not to participate until substituted, this scheme is likewise attended by practical difficulties and offends &ldquo;the cardinal principle that the deliberations of the jury shall remain private and secret in every case.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Virginia Erection Corp</em>., 335 F.2d 868 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment provides that if a juror is excused after the jury has retired to consider its verdict, it is within the discretion of the court whether to declare a mistrial or to permit deliberations to continue with 11 jurors. If the trial has been brief and not much would be lost by retrial, the court might well conclude that the unusual step of allowing a jury verdict by less than 12 jurors absent stipulation should not be taken. On the other hand, if the trial has been protracted the court is much more likely to opt for continuing with the remaining 11 jurors.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 23 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">In current Rule 23(b), the term &ldquo;just cause&rdquo; has been replaced with the more familiar term &ldquo;good cause,&rdquo; that appears in other rules. No change in substance is intended.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule is similar to Rule 47(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix] and also embodies the practice now followed by many Federal courts in criminal cases. Uniform procedure in civil and criminal cases on this point seems desirable.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule embodies existing law, 28 U.S.C. 424 [now 1870] (Challenges), with the following modifications. In capital cases the number of challenges is equalized as between the defendant and the United States so that both sides have 20 challenges, which only the defendant has at present. While continuing the existing rule that multiple defendants are deemed a single party for purposes of challenges, the rule vests in the court discretion to allow additional peremptory challenges to multiple defendants and to permit such challenges to be exercised separately or jointly. Experience with cases involving numerous defendants indicates the desirability of this modification.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). This rule embodies existing law, 28 U.S.C. [former] 417a (Alternate jurors), as well as the practice prescribed for civil cases by Rule 47(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix], except that the number of possible alternate jurors that may be impaneled is increased from two to four, with a corresponding adjustment of challenges.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Experience has demonstrated that four alternate jurors may not be enough for some lengthy criminal trials. See e.g., <em>United States v. Bentvena</em>, 288 F.2d 442 (2d Cir. 1961); Reports of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States, 1961, p. 104. The amendment to the first sentence increases the number authorized from four to six. The fourth sentence is amended to provide an additional peremptory challenge where a fifth or sixth alternate juror is used.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;or are found to be&rdquo; are added to the second sentence to make clear that an alternate juror may be called in the situation where it is first discovered during the trial that a juror was unable or disqualified to perform his duties at the time he was sworn. See <em>United States v. Goldberg</em>, 330 F.2d 30 (3rd Cir. 1964), cert. den. 377 U.S. 953 (1964).</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1999 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">As currently written, Rule 24(c) explicitly requires the court to discharge all of the alternate jurors&mdash;who have not been selected to replace other jurors&mdash;when the jury retires to deliberate. That requirement is grounded on the concern that after the case has been submitted to the jury, its deliberations must be private and inviolate. <em>United States v. Houlihan</em>, 92 F.3d 1271, 1285 (1st Cir. 1996), citing <em>United States v. Virginia Election Corp</em>., 335 F.2d 868, 872 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 23(b) provides that in some circumstances a verdict may be returned by eleven jurors. In addition, there may be cases where it is better to retain the alternates when the jury retires, insulate them from the deliberation process, and have them available should one or more vacancies occur in the jury. That might be especially appropriate in a long, costly, and complicated case. To that end the Committee believed that the court should have the discretion to decide whether to retain or discharge the alternates at the time the jury retires to deliberate and to use Rule 23(b) to proceed with eleven jurors or to substitute a juror or ju<!-- PDFPage:100 -->rors with alternate jurors who have not been discharged.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to protect the sanctity of the deliberative process, the rule requires the court to take appropriate steps to insulate the alternate jurors. That may be done, for example, by separating the alternates from the deliberating jurors and instructing the alternate jurors not to discuss the case with any other person until they replace a regular juror. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Olano</em>, 507 U.S. 725 (1993) (not plain error to permit alternate jurors to sit in during deliberations); <em>United States v. Houlihan</em>, 92 F.3d 1271, 1286&ndash;88 (1st Cir. 1996) (harmless error to retain alternate jurors in violation of Rule 24(c); in finding harmless error the court cited the steps taken by the trial judge to insulate the alternates). If alternates are used, the jurors must be instructed that they must begin their deliberations anew.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, subsection (c) has been reorganized and restyled.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>GAP Report&mdash;Rule 24(c).</strong> The final sentence of Rule 24(c) was moved from the committee note to the rule to emphasize that if an alternate replaces a juror during deliberations, the court shall instruct the jury to begin its deliberations anew.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 24 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">In restyling Rule 24(a), the Committee deleted the language that authorized the defendant to conduct voir dire of prospective jurors. The Committee believed that the current language was potentially ambiguous and could lead one incorrectly to conclude that a defendant, represented by counsel, could personally conduct voir dire or additional voir dire. The Committee believed that the intent of the current provision was to permit a defendant to participate personally in voir dire only if the defendant was acting pro se. Amended Rule 24(a) refers only to attorneys for the parties, i.e., the defense counsel and the attorney for the government, with the understanding that if the defendant is not represented by counsel, the court may still, in its discretion, permit the defendant to participate in voir dire. In summary, the Committee intends no change in practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the rule authorizes the court in multi-defendant cases to grant additional peremptory challenges to the defendants. If the court does so, the prosecution may request additional challenges in a multi-defendant case, not to exceed the total number available to the defendants jointly. The court, however, is not required to equalize the number of challenges where additional challenges are granted to the defendant.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In September, 1963, the Judicial Conference of the United States approved a recommendation of its Committee on Court Administration that provision be made for substitution of a judge who becomes disabled during trial. The problem has become serious because of the increase in the number of long criminal trials. See 1963 Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, p. 114, reporting a 25% increase in criminal trials lasting more than one week in fiscal year 1963 over 1962.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;The amendment casts the rule into two subdivisions and in subdivision (a) provides for substitution of a judge during a jury trial upon his certification that he has familiarized himself with the record of the trial. For similar provisions see Alaska Rules of Crim. Proc., Rule 25; California Penal Code, &sect;1053.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;The words &ldquo;from the district&rdquo; are deleted to permit the local judge to act in those situations where a judge who has been assigned from within the district to try the case is, at the time for sentence, etc., back at his regular place of holding court which may be several hundred miles from the place of trial. It is not intended, of course, that substitutions shall be made where the judge who tried the case is available within a reasonable distance from the place of trial.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. This rule contemplates the development of a uniform body of rules of evidence to be applicable in trials <!-- PDFPage:101 -->of criminal cases in the Federal courts. It is based on <em>Funk v. United States</em>, 290 U.S. 371, and <em>Wolfle v. United States</em>, 291 U.S. 7, which indicated that in the absence of statute the Federal courts in criminal cases are not bound by the State law of evidence, but are guided by common law principles as interpreted by the Federal courts &ldquo;in the light of reason and experience.&rdquo; The rule does not fetter the applicable law of evidence to that originally existing at common law. It is contemplated that the law may be modified and adjusted from time to time by judicial decisions. See Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 655; Vanderbilt, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 377; Holtzoff, 12 George Washington L.R. 119, 131&ndash;132; Holtzoff, 3 F.R.D. 445, 453; Howard, 51 Yale L.Jour. 763; Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 5&ndash;6.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. This rule differs from the corresponding rule for civil cases (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 43(a) [28 U.S.C., Appendix]), in that this rule contemplates a uniform body of rules of evidence to govern in criminal trials in the Federal courts, while the rule for civil cases prescribes partial conformity to State law and, therefore, results in a divergence as between various districts. Since in civil actions in which Federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, the State substantive law governs the rights of the parties, uniformity of rules of evidence among different districts does not appear necessary. On the other hand, since all Federal crimes are statutory and all criminal prosecutions in the Federal courts are based on acts of Congress, uniform rules of evidence appear desirable if not essential in criminal cases, as otherwise the same facts under differing rules of evidence may lead to a conviction in one district and to an acquittal in another.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. This rule expressly continues existing statutes governing the admissibility of evidence and the competency and privileges of witnesses. Among such statutes are the following:</p>

<p class="note-body">The first sentence is retained, with appropriate narrowing of the title, since its subject is not covered in the Rules of Evidence. The second sentence is deleted because the Rules of Evidence govern admissibility of evidence, competency of witnesses, and privilege.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A party intending to raise an issue of foreign law must provide the court and all parties with reasonable written notice. Issues of foreign law are questions of law, but in deciding such issues a court may consider any relevant material or source&mdash;including testimony&mdash;without regard to the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<!-- field-end:statute -->
<!-- field-start:sourcecredit -->
<p class="source-credit">(Added Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; amended Nov. 20, 1972, eff. July 1, 1975; Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966</h4>
<p class="note-body">The original Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure did not contain a provision explicitly regulating the determination of foreign law. The resolution of issues of foreign law, when relevant in federal criminal proceedings, falls within the general compass of Rule 26 which provides for application of &ldquo;the [evidentiary] principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.&rdquo; See Green, Preliminary Report on the Advisability and Feasibility of Developing Uniform Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts 6&ndash;7, 17&ndash;18 (1962). Although traditional &ldquo;commonlaw&rdquo; methods for determining foreign-country law have proved inadequate, the courts have not developed more appropriate practices on the basis of this flexible rule. Cf. Green, op. cit. supra at 26&ndash;28. On the inadequacy of common-law procedures for determining foreign law, see, e.g., Nussbaum, Proving the Law of Foreign Countries, 3 Am.J.Comp.L. 60 (1954).</p>
<p class="note-body">Problems of foreign law that must be resolved in accordance with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are most likely to arise in places such as Washington, D.C., the Canal Zone, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, where the federal courts have general criminal jurisdiction. However, issues of foreign law may also arise in criminal proceedings commenced in other federal districts. For example, in an extradition proceeding, reasonable ground to believe that the person sought to be extradited is charged with, or was convicted of, a crime under the laws of the demanding state must generally be shown. See <em>Factor v. Laubenheimer</em>, 290 U.S. 276 (1933); <em>Fernandez v. Phillips</em>, 268 U.S. 311 (1925); Bishop International Law: Cases and Materials (2d ed. 1962). Further, foreign law may be invoked to justify non-compliance with a subpoena duces tecum, <em>Application of Chase Manhattan Bank</em>, 297 F.2d 611 (2d Cir. 1962), and under certain circumstances, as a defense to prosecution. Cf. <em>American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co</em>., 213 U.S. 347 (1909). The content of foreign law may also be relevant in proceedings arising under 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1201, 2312&ndash;2317.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 26.1 is substantially the same as Civil Rule 44.1. A full explanation of the merits and practicability of the rule appear in the Advisory Committee's Note to Civil Rule 44.1. It is necessary here to add only one comment to the explanations there made. The second sentence of the rule frees the court from the restraints of the ordinary rules of evidence in determining foreign law. This freedom, made necessary by the peculiar nature of the issue of foreign law, should not constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of the defendant's <!-- PDFPage:102 -->rights to confrontation of witnesses. The issue is essentially one of law rather than of fact. Furthermore, the cases have held that the Sixth Amendment does not serve as a rigid barrier against the development of reasonable and necessary exceptions to the hearsay rule. See <em>Kay v. United States</em>, 255 F.2d 476, 480 (4th Cir. 1958), cert. den., 358 U.S. 825 (1958); <em>Matthews v. United States</em>, 217 F.2d 409, 418 (5th Cir. 1954); <em>United States v. Leathers</em>, 135 F.2d 507 (2d Cir. 1943); and cf., <em>Painter v. Texas</em>, 85 S.Ct. 1065 (1965); <em>Douglas v. Alabama</em>, 85 S.Ct. 1074 (1965).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979</h4>
<p class="note-body">S. 1437, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), would place in the criminal rules the substance of what is now 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500 (the Jencks Act). Underlying this and certain other additions to the rules contemplated by S. 1437 is the notion that provisions which are purely procedural in nature should appear in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure rather than in Title 18. See Reform of the Federal Criminal Laws, Part VI: Hearings on S. 1, S. 716, and S. 1400, Subcomm. on Criminal Laws and Procedures, Senate Judiciary Comm., 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. (statement of Judge Albert B. Maris, at page 5503). Rule 26.2 is identical to the S.1437 rule except as indicated by the marked additions and deletions. As those changes show, rule 26.2 provides for production of the statements of defense witnesses at trial in essentially the same manner as is now provided for with respect to the statements of government witnesses. Thus, the proposed rule reflects these two judgments: (i) that the subject matter&mdash;production of the statements of witnesses&mdash;is more appropriately dealt with in the criminal rules; and (ii) that in light of <em>United States v. Nobles</em>, 422 U.S. 225 (1975), it is important to establish procedures for the production of defense witnesses&rsquo; statements as well. The rule is not intended to discourage the practice of voluntary disclosure at an earlier time so as to avoid delays at trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Nobles</em>, defense counsel sought to introduce the testimony of a defense investigator who prior to trial had interviewed prospective prosecution witnesses and had prepared a report embodying the essence of their conversation. When the defendant called the investigator to impeach eyewitness testimony identifying the defendant as the robber, the trial judge granted the prosecutor the right to inspect those portions of the investigator's report relating to the witnesses&rsquo; statements, as a potential basis for cross-examination of the investigator. When the defense declined to produce the report, the trail judge refused to permit the investigator to testify. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the trail court's actions, finding that neither the Fifth nor Sixth Amendments nor the attorney work product doctrine prevented disclosure of such a document at trial. Noting &ldquo;the federal judiciary's inherent power to require the prosecution to produce the previously re<!-- PDFPage:103 -->corded statements of its witnesses so that the defense may get the full benefit of cross-examinations and the truth-finding process may be enhanced,&rdquo; the Court rejected the notion &ldquo;that the Fifth amendment renders criminal discovery &lsquo;basically a one-way street,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; and thus concluded that &ldquo;in a proper case, the prosecution can call upon that same power for production of witness statements that facilitate &lsquo;full disclosure of all the [relevant] facts.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule, consistent with the reasoning in <em>Nobles</em>, is designed to place the disclosure of prior relevant statements of a defense witness in the possession of the defense on the same legal footing as is the disclosure of prior statements of prosecution witnesses in the hands of the government under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500 (which S. 1437 would replace with the rule set out therein). See <em>United States v. Pulvirenti</em>, 408 F.Supp. 12 (E.D.Mich. 1976), holding that under <em>Nobles</em> &ldquo;[t]he obligation [of disclosure] placed on the defendant should be the reciprocal of that placed upon the government *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [as] defined by the Jencks Act.&rdquo; Several state courts have likewise concluded that witness statements in the hands of the defense at trial should be disclosed on the same basis that prosecution witness statements are disclosed, in order to promote the concept of the trail as a search for truth. See, e.g., <em>People v. Sanders</em>, 110 Ill.App.2d 85, 249 N.E.2d 124 (1969); <em>State v. Montague</em>, 55 N.J. 371, 262 A.2d 398 (1970); <em>People v. Damon</em>, 24 N.Y.2d 256, 299 N.Y.S.2d 830, 247 N.E.2d 651 (1959).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule, with minor exceptions, makes the procedure identical for both prosecution and defense witnesses, including the provision directing the court, whenever a claim is made that disclosure would be improper because the statement contains irrelevant matter, to examine the statements in camera and excise such matter as should not be disclosed. This provision acts as a safeguard against abuse and will enable a defendant who believes that a demand is being improperly made to secure a swift and just resolution of the issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">The treatment as to defense witnesses of necessity differs slightly from the treatment as to prosecution witnesses in terms of the sanction for a refusal to comply with the court's disclosure order. Under the Jencks Act and the rule proposed in S. 1437, if the prosecution refuses to abide by the court's order, the court is required to strike the witness's testimony unless in its discretion it determines that the more serious sanction of a mistrial in favor of the accused is warranted. Under this rule, if a defendant refuses to comply with the court's disclosure order, the court's only alternative is to enter an order striking or precluding the testimony of the witness, as was done in <em>Nobles.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (a) of the rule, the motion for production may be made by &ldquo;a party who did not call the witness.&rdquo; Thus, it also requires disclosure of statements in the possession of either party when the witness is called neither by the prosecution nor the defense but by the court pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence. Present law does not deal with this situation, which consistency requires be treated in an identical manner as the disclosure of statements of witnesses called by a party to the case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (g) recognizes other contemporaneous amendments in the Rules of Criminal Procedure which extend the application of Rule 26.2 to other proceedings. Those changes are thus consistent with the extension of Rule 26.2 in 1983 to suppression hearings conducted under Rule 12. <em>See</em> Rule 12(i).</p>
<p class="note-body">In extending Rule 26.2 to suppression hearings in 1983, the Committee offered several reasons. First, production of witness statements enhances the ability of the court to assess the witnesses&rsquo; credibility and thus assists the court in making accurate factual determinations at suppression hearings. Second, because witnesses testifying at a suppression hearing may not necessarily testify at the trial itself, waiting until after a witness testifies at trial before requiring production of that witness's statement would be futile. Third, the Committee believed that it would be feasible to leave the suppression issue open until trial, where Rule 26.2 would then be applicable. Finally, one of the central reasons for requiring production of statements at suppression hearings was the recognition that by its nature, the results of a suppression hearing have a profound and ultimate impact on the issues presented at trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reasons given in 1983 for extending Rule 26.2 to a suppression hearing are equally compelling with regard to other adversary type hearings which ultimately depend on accurate and reliable information. That is, there is a continuing need for information affecting the credibility of witnesses who present testimony. And that need exists without regard to whether the witness is presenting testimony at a pretrial hearing, at a trial, or at a post-trial proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">As noted in the 1983 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 12(i), the courts have generally declined to extend the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500, beyond the confines of actual trial testimony. That result will be obviated by the addition of Rule 26.2(g) and amendments to the Rules noted in that new subdivision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although amendments to Rules 32, 32.1, 46, and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 specifically address the requirement of producing a witness's statement, Rule 26.2 has become known as the central &ldquo;rule&rdquo; requiring production of statements. Thus, the references in the Rule itself will assist the bench and bar in locating other Rules which include similar provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 26.2 and the other designated Rules is not intended to require production of a witness's statement before the witness actually testifies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor conforming amendments have been made to subsection (d) to reflect that Rule 26.2 will be applicable to proceedings other than the trial itself. And language has been added to subsection (c) to recognize explicitly that privileged matter may be excised from the witness's prior statement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (g) mirrors similar amendments made in 1993 to this rule and to other Rules of Criminal Procedure which extended the application of Rule 26.2 to other proceedings, both pretrial and post-trial. This amendment extends the requirement of producing a witness&rsquo; statement to preliminary examinations conducted under Rule 5.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g)(1) has been amended to reflect changes to Rule 32.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 26.2 After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Committee made no changes to the published draft.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 26.2 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Current Rule 26.2(c) states that if the court withholds a portion of a statement, over the defendant's objection, &ldquo;the attorney for the government&rdquo; must preserve the statement. The Committee believed that the better rule would be for the court to simply seal the entire statement as a part of the record, in the event that there is an appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, the terminology in Rule 26.2(c) has been changed. The rule now speaks in terms of a &ldquo;redacted&rdquo; <!-- PDFPage:104 -->statement instead of an &ldquo;excised&rdquo; statement. No change in practice is intended.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 26.3 is a new rule designed to reduce the possibility of an erroneously ordered mistrial which could produce adverse and irretrievable consequences. The Rule is not designed to change the substantive law governing mistrials. Instead it is directed at providing both sides an opportunity to place on the record their views about the proposed mistrial order. In particular, the court must give each side an opportunity to state whether it objects or consents to the order.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several cases have held that retrial of a defendant was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution because the trial court had abused its discretion in declaring a mistrial. <em>See United States v. Dixon</em>, 913 F.2d 1305 (8th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Bates</em>, 917 F.2d 388 (9th Cir. 1990). In both cases the appellate courts concluded that the trial court had acted precipitately and had failed to solicit the parties&rsquo; views on the necessity of a mistrial and the feasibility of any alternative action. The new Rule is designed to remedy that situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee regards the Rule as a balanced and modest procedural device that could benefit both the prosecution and the defense. While the <em>Dixon</em> and <em>Bates</em> decisions adversely affected the government's interest in prosecuting serious crimes, the new Rule could also benefit defendants. The Rule ensures that a defendant has the opportunity to dissuade a judge from declaring a mistrial in a case where granting one would not be an abuse of discretion, but the defendant believes that the prospects for a favorable outcome before that particular court, or jury, are greater than they might be upon retrial.</p>

<p class="note-body">The power of the court to call its own witnesses, though rarely invoked, is recognized in the Federal courts, <em>Young v. United States</em>, 107 F.2d 490 (C.C.A. 5th); <em>Litsinger v. United States</em>, 44 F.2d 45 (C.C.A. 7th).

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 29. Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Before Submission to the Jury.</cap-smallcap> After the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the defendant's motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. The court may on its own consider whether the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. If the court denies a motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's evidence, the defend<!-- PDFPage:106 -->ant may offer evidence without having reserved the right to do so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reserving Decision.</cap-smallcap> The court may reserve decision on the motion, proceed with the trial (where the motion is made before the close of all the evidence), submit the case to the jury, and decide the motion either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict. If the court reserves decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>After Jury Verdict or Discharge.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Time for a Motion.</em> A defendant may move for a judgment of acquittal, or renew such a motion, within 14 days after a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Ruling on the Motion.</em> If the jury has returned a guilty verdict, the court may set aside the verdict and enter an acquittal. If the jury has failed to return a verdict, the court may enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>No Prior Motion Required.</em> A defendant is not required to move for a judgment of acquittal before the court submits the case to the jury as a prerequisite for making such a motion after jury discharge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Conditional Ruling on a Motion for a New Trial.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Motion for a New Trial.</em> If the court enters a judgment of acquittal after a guilty verdict, the court must also conditionally determine whether any motion for a new trial should be granted if the judgment of acquittal is later vacated or reversed. The court must specify the reasons for that determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Finality.</em> The court's order conditionally granting a motion for a new trial does not affect the finality of the judgment of acquittal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Appeal.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Grant of a Motion for a New Trial</em>. If the court conditionally grants a motion for a new trial and an appellate court later reverses the judgment of acquittal, the trial court must proceed with the new trial unless the appellate court orders otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Denial of a Motion for a New Trial</em>. If the court conditionally denies a motion for a new trial, an appellee may assert that the denial was erroneous. If the appellate court later reverses the judgment of acquittal, the trial court must proceed as the appellate court directs.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The purpose of changing the name of a motion for a directed verdict to a motion for judgment of acquittal is to make the nomenclature accord with the realities. The change of nomenclature, however, does not modify the nature of the motion or enlarge the scope of matters that may be considered.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The second sentence is patterned on New York Code of Criminal Procedure, sec. 410.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The purpose of the third sentence is to remove the doubt existing in a few jurisdictions on the question whether the defendant is deemed to have rested his case if he moves for a directed verdict at the close of the prosecution's case. The purpose of the rule is expressly to preserve the right of the defendant to offer evidence in his own behalf, if such motion is denied. This is a restatement of the prevailing practice, and is also in accord with the practice prescribed for civil cases by Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule is in substance similar to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C., Appendix, and permits the court to render judgment for the defendant notwithstanding a verdict of guilty. Some Federal courts have recognized and approved the use of a judgment non obstante veredicto for the defendant in a criminal case, <em>Ex parte United States</em>, 101 F.2d 870 (C.C.A. 7th), affirmed by an equally divided court, <em>United States v. Stone</em>, 308 U.S. 519. The rule sanctions this practice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;A minor change has been made in the caption.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;The last three sentences are deleted with the matters formerly covered by them transferred to the new subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c).&mdash;The new subdivision makes several changes in the former procedure. A motion for judgment of acquittal may be made after discharge of the jury whether or not a motion was made before submission to the jury. No legitimate interest of the government is intended to be prejudiced by permitting the court to direct an acquittal on a post-verdict motion. The constitutional requirement of a jury trial in criminal cases is primarily a right accorded to the defendant. Cf. <em>Adams v. United States, ex rel. McCann</em>, 317 U.S. 269 (1942); <em>Singer v. United States</em>, 380 U.S. 24 (1965); Note, 65 Yale L.J. 1032 (1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">The time in which the motion may be made has been changed to 7 days in accordance with the amendment to Rule 45(a) which by excluding Saturday from the days to be counted when the period of time is less than 7 days would make 7 days the normal time for a motion required to be made in 5 days. Also the court is authorized to extend the time as is provided for motions for new trial (Rule 33) and in arrest of judgment (Rule 34).</p>
<p class="note-body">References in the original rule to the motion for a new trial as an alternate to the motion for judgment of acquittal and to the power of the court to order a new trial have been eliminated. Motions for new trial are adequately covered in Rule 33. Also the original wording is subject to the interpretation that a motion for judgment of acquittal gives the court power to order a new trial even though the defendant does not wish a new trial and has not asked for one.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment permits the reservation of a motion for a judgment of acquittal made at the close of the government's case in the the same manner as the rule now permits for motions made at the close of all of the evidence. Although the rule as written did not permit the court to reserve such motions made at the end of the government's case, trial courts on occasion have nonetheless reserved ruling. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bruno</em>, 873 F.2d 555 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 110 S.Ct. 125 (1989); <em>United States v. Reifsteck</em>, 841 F.2d 701 (6th Cir. 1988). While the amendment will not affect a large number of cases, it should remove the dilemma in those close cases in which the court would feel pressured into making an immediate, and possibly erroneous, decision or violating the rule as presently written by reserving its ruling on the motion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also permits the trial court to balance the defendant's interest in an immediate resolution of the motion against the interest of the government in proceeding to a verdict thereby preserving its <!-- PDFPage:107 -->right to appeal in the event a verdict of guilty is returned but is then set aside by the granting of a judgment of acquittal. Under the double jeopardy clause the government may appeal the granting of a motion for judgment of acquittal only if there would be no necessity for another trial, i.e., only where the jury has returned a verdict of guilty. <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co</em>., 430 U.S. 564 (1977). Thus, the government's right to appeal a Rule 29 motion is only preserved where the ruling is reserved until after the verdict.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addressing the issue of preserving the government's right to appeal and at the same time recognizing double jeopardy concerns, the Supreme Court observed:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;We should point out that it is entirely possible for a trial court to reconcile the public interest in the Government's right to appeal from an erroneous conclusion of law with the defendant's interest in avoiding a second prosecution. In <em>United States v. Wilson</em>, 420 U.S. 332 (1975), the court permitted the case to go to the jury, which returned a verdict of guilty, but it subsequently dismissed the indictment for preindictment delay on the basis of evidence adduced at trial. Most recently in <em>United States v. Ceccolini</em>, 435 U.S. 268 (1978), we described similar action with approval: &lsquo;The District Court had sensibly made its finding on the factual question of guilt or innocence, and then ruled on the motion to suppress; a reversal of these rulings would require no further proceeding in the District Court, but merely a reinstatement of the finding of guilt.&rsquo; Id. at 271.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>United States v. Scott</em>, 437 U.S. 82, 100 n. 13 (1978). By analogy, reserving a ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal strikes the same balance as that reflected by the Supreme Court in <em>Scott.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Reserving a ruling on a motion made at the end of the government's case does pose problems, however, where the defense decides to present evidence and run the risk that such evidence will support the government's case. To address that problem, the amendment provides that the trial court is to consider only the evidence submitted at the time of the motion in making its ruling, whenever made. And in reviewing a trial court's ruling, the appellate court would be similarly limited.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 29 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">In Rule 29(a), the first sentence abolishing &ldquo;directed verdicts&rdquo; has been deleted because it is unnecessary. The rule continues to recognize that a judge may sua sponte enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 29(c)(1) addresses the issue of the timing of a motion for judgment of acquittal. The amended rule now includes language that the motion must be made within 7 days after a guilty verdict or after the judge discharges the jury, whichever occurs later. That change reflects the fact that in a capital case or in a case involving criminal forfeiture, for example, the jury may not be discharged until it has completed its sentencing duties. The court may still set another time for the defendant to make or renew the motion, if it does so within the 7-day period.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 29(c) has been amended to remove the requirement that the court must act within seven days after a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury, if it sets another time for filing a motion for a judgment of acquittal. This amendment parallels similar changes to Rules 33 and 34. Further, a conforming amendment has been made to Rule 45(b)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Currently, Rule 29(c) requires the defendant to move for a judgment of acquittal within seven days of the guilty verdict, or after the court discharges the jury, whichever occurs later, or some other time set by the court in an order issued within that same seven-day period. Similar provisions exist in Rules 33 and 34. Courts have held that the seven-day rule is jurisdictional. Thus, if a defendant files a request for an extension of time to file a motion for a judgment of acquittal within the seven-day period, the court must rule on that motion or request within the same seven-day period. If for some reason the court does not rule on the request within the seven days, it loses jurisdiction to act on the underlying substantive motion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith</em>, 331 U.S. 469, 473&ndash;474 (1947) (rejecting argument that trial court had power to grant new trial on its own motion after expiration of time in Rule 33); <em>United States v. Marquez</em>, 291 F.3d 23, 27&ndash;28 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing language of Rule 33, and holding that &ldquo;district court forfeited the power to act when it failed to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fix a new time for filing a motion for a new trial within seven days of the verdict&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Assuming that the current rule was intended to promote finality, there is nothing to prevent the court from granting a significant extension of time, so long as it does so within the seven-day period. Thus, the Committee believed that the rule should be amended to be consistent with all of the other timing requirements in the rules, which do not force the court to act on a motion to extend the time for filing within a particular period of time or lose jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, the amendment deletes the language regarding the court's acting within seven days to set the time for filing. Read in conjunction with the conforming amendment to Rule 45(b), the defendant is still required to file a timely motion for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 within the seven-day period specified. The defendant may, under Rule 45, seek an extension of time to file the underlying motion as long as the defendant does so within the seven-day period. But the court itself is not required to act on that motion within any particular time. Further, under Rule 45(b)(1)(B), if for some reason the defendant fails to file the underlying motion within the specified time, the court may nonetheless consider that untimely motion if the court determines that the failure to file it on time was the result of excusable neglect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. The Committee made no substantive changes to Rule 29 following publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Former Rules 29, 33, and 34 adopted 7-day periods for their respective motions. This period has been expanded to 14 days. Experience has proved that in many cases it is not possible to prepare a satisfactory motion in 7 days, even under the former rule that excluded intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. This led to frequent requests for continuances, and the filing of bare bones motions that required later supplementation. The 14-day period&mdash;including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays as provided by Rule 45(a)&mdash;sets a more realistic time for the filing of these motions.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule is designed to control the order of closing argument. It reflects the Advisory Committee's view that it is desirable to have a uniform federal practice.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court, Rule 29.1 is a new rule that was added to regulate closing arguments. It prescribes that the government shall make its closing argument and then the defendant shall make his. After the defendant has argued, the government is entitled to reply in rebuttal.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee endorses and adopts this proposed rule in its entirety. The Committee believes that as the Advisory Committee Note has stated, fair and effective administration of justice is best served if the defendant knows the arguments actually made by the prosecution in behalf of conviction before the defendant is faced with the decision whether to reply and what to reply. Rule 29.1 does not specifically address itself to what happens if the prosecution waives its initial closing argument. The Committee is of the view that the prosecutor, when he waives his initial closing argument, also waives his rebuttal. [See the remarks of Senior United States Circuit Judge J. Edward Lumbard in Hearings II, at 207.]</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule corresponds to Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix], the second sentence alone being new. It seemed appropriate that on a point such as instructions to juries there should be no difference in procedure between civil and criminal cases.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment requires the court, on request of any party, to require the jury to withdraw in order to permit full argument of objections to instructions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In its current form, Rule 30 requires that the court instruct the jury after the arguments of counsel. In some districts, usually where the state practice is otherwise, the parties prefer to stipulate to instruction before closing arguments. The purpose of the amendment is to give the court discretion to instruct the jury before or after closing arguments, or at both times. The amendment will permit courts to continue instructing the jury after arguments as Rule 30 had previously required. It will also permit courts to instruct before arguments in order to give the parties an opportunity to argue to the jury in light of the exact language used by the court. See generally Raymond, <em>Merits and Demerits of the Missouri System in Instructing Juries</em>, 5 St. Louis U.L.J. 317 (1959). Finally, the amendment plainly indicates that the court may instruct both before and after arguments, which assures that the court retains power to remedy omissions in pre-argument instructions or to add instructions necessitated by the arguments.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1988 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 30 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 30(a) reflects a change in the timing of requests for instructions. As currently written, the trial court may not direct the parties to file such requests before trial without violating Rules 30 and 57. While the amendment falls short of requiring all requests to be made before trial in all cases, the amendment permits a court to do so in a particular case or as a matter of local practice under local rules promulgated under Rule 57. The rule does not preclude the practice of permitting the parties to supplement their requested instructions during the trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 30(d) clarifies what, if anything, counsel must do to preserve a claim of error regarding an instruction or failure to instruct. The rule retains the requirement of a contemporaneous and specific objection (before the jury retires to deliberate). As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Jones v. United States</em>, 527 U.S. 373 (1999), read literally, current Rule 30 could be construed to bar any appellate review absent a timely objection when in fact a court may conduct a limited review under a plain error standard. The amendment does not address the issue of whether objections to the instructions must be renewed after the instructions are given, in order to preserve a claim of error. No change in practice is intended by the amendment.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) is new. It is intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title IX, &sect;1963, and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II, &sect;408(a)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The assumption of the draft is that the amount of the interest or property subject to criminal forfeiture is an element of the offense to be alleged and proved. See Advisory Committee Note to rule 7(c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although special verdict provisions are rare in criminal cases, they are not unknown. See <em>United States v. Spock</em>, 416 F. 2d 165 (1st Cir. 1969), especially footnote 41 where authorities are listed.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The right of a party to have the jury polled is an &ldquo;undoubted right.&rdquo; <em>Humphries v. District of Columbia</em>, 174 U.S. 190, 194 (1899). Its purpose is to determine with certainty that &ldquo;each of the jurors approves of the verdict as returned; that no one has been coerced or induced to sign a verdict to which he does not fully assent.&rdquo; <em>Id.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Currently, Rule 31(d) is silent on the precise method of polling the jury. Thus, a court in its discretion may conduct the poll collectively or individually. As one court has noted, although the prevailing view is that the method used is a matter within the discretion of the trial court, <em>United States v. Miller</em>, 59 F.3d 417, 420 (3d Cir. 1995) (citing cases), the preference, nonetheless of the appellate and trial courts, seems to favor individual polling. <em>Id</em>. (citing cases). That is the position taken in the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice &sect;15&ndash;4.5. Those sources favoring individual polling observe that conducting a poll of the jurors collectively saves little time and does not always adequately insure that an individual juror who has been forced to join the majority during deliberations will voice dissent from a collective response. On the other hand, an advantage to individual polling is the &ldquo;likelihood that it will discourage post-trial efforts to challenge the verdict on allegations of coercion on the part of some of the jurors.&rdquo; <em>Miller, Id</em>. at 420 (citing <em>Audette v. Isaksen Fishing Corp</em>., 789 F.2d 956, 961, n. 6 (1st Cir. 1986)).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee is persuaded by the authorities and practice that there are advantages of conducting an individual poll of the jurors. Thus, the rule requires that the jurors be polled individually when a polling is requested, or when polling is directed sua sponte by the court. The amendment, however, leaves to the court the discretion as to whether to conduct a separate poll for each defendant, each count of the indictment or complaint, or on other issues.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 31 After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Committee changed the rule to require that any polling of the jury must be done before the jury is discharged and it incorporated suggested style changes submitted by the Style Subcommittee.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to reflect the creation of new Rule 32.2, which now governs criminal forfeiture procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>GAP Report&mdash;Rule 31.</strong> The Committee made no changes to the published draft amendment to Rule 31.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 31 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 31(b) has been amended to clarify that a jury may return partial verdicts, either as to multiple defendants or multiple counts, or both. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cunningham</em>, 145 F.3d 1385, 1388&ndash;90 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (partial verdicts on multiple defendants and counts). No change in practice is intended.</p>
