<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Federal Prison Industries shall determine in what manner and to what extent industrial operations shall be carried on in Federal penal and correctional institutions for the production of commodities for consumption in such institutions or for sale to the departments or agencies of the United States, but not for sale to the public in competition with private enterprise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Its board of directors shall provide employment for the greatest number of those inmates in the United States penal and correctional institutions who are eligible to work as is reasonably possible, diversify, so far as practicable, prison industrial operations and so operate the prison shops that no single private industry shall be forced to bear an undue burden of competition from the products of the prison workshops, and to reduce to a minimum competition with private industry or free labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Federal Prison Industries shall conduct its operations so as to produce products on an economic basis, but shall avoid capturing more than a reasonable share of the market among Federal departments, agencies, and institutions for any specific product. Federal Prison Industries shall concentrate on providing to the Federal Government only those products which permit employment of the greatest number of those inmates who are eligible to work as is reasonably possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Federal Prison Industries shall diversify its products so that its sales are distributed among its industries as broadly as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any decision by Federal Prison Industries to produce a new product or to significantly expand the production of an existing product shall be made by the board of directors of the corporation. Before the board of directors makes a final decision, the corporation shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The corporation shall prepare a detailed written analysis of the probable impact on industry and free labor of the plans for new production or expanded production. In such written analysis the corporation shall, at a minimum, identify and consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the number of vendors currently meeting the requirements of the Federal Government for the product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the proportion of the Federal Government market for the product currently served by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or businesses operating in labor surplus areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the size of the Federal Government and non-Federal Government markets for the product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the projected growth in the Federal Government demand for the product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the projected ability of the Federal Government market to sustain both Federal Prison Industries and private vendors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The corporation shall announce in a publication designed to most effectively provide notice to potentially affected private vendors the plans to produce any new product or to significantly expand production of an existing product. The announcement shall also indicate that the analysis prepared under subparagraph (A) is available through the corporation and shall invite comments from private industry regarding the new production or expanded production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The corporation shall directly advise those affected trade associations that the corporation can reasonably identify the plans for new production or expanded production, and the corporation shall invite such trade associations to submit comments on those plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The corporation shall provide to the board of directors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the analysis prepared under subparagraph (A) on the proposal to produce a new product or to significantly expand the production of an existing product,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) comments submitted to the corporation on the proposal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the corporation's recommendations for action on the proposal in light of such comments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition, the board of directors, before making a final decision under this paragraph on a proposal, shall, upon the request of an established trade association or other interested representatives of private industry, provide a reasonable opportunity to such trade association or other representatives to present comments directly to the board of directors on the proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Federal Prison Industries shall publish in the manner specified in paragraph (4)(B) the final decision of the board with respect to the production of a new product or the significant expansion of the production of an existing product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Federal Prison Industries shall publish, after the end of each 6-month period, a list of sales by the corporation for that 6-month period. Such list shall be made available to all interested parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Its board of directors may provide for the vocational training of qualified inmates without regard to their industrial or other assignments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the industrial employment and training of prisoners convicted by general courts-martial and confined in any institution under the jurisdiction of any department or agency comprising the Department of Defense, to the extent and under terms and conditions agreed upon by the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General and the Board of Directors of Federal Prison Industries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any department or agency of the Department of Defense may, without exchange of <!-- PDFPage:798 -->funds, transfer to Federal Prison Industries any property or equipment suitable for use in performing the functions and duties covered by agreement entered into under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the industrial employment and training of prisoners confined in any penal or correctional institution under the direction of the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to the extent and under terms and conditions agreed upon by the Commissioner, the Attorney General, and the Board of Directors of Federal Prison Industries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commissioner of the District of Columbia may, without exchange of funds, transfer to the Federal Prison Industries any property or equipment suitable for use in performing the functions and duties covered by an agreement entered into under subsection (e)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect the provisions of the Act approved October 3, 1964 (D.C.

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;744d, 744e, 744f, 744<em>l</em> (May 27, 1930, ch. 340, &sect;&sect;4&ndash;6, 46 Stat. 391, 392; June 23, 1934, ch. 736, &sect;4, 48 Stat. 1211).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section is a restatement of section 744<em>l</em> of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with which sections 744d and 744f and the first sentence of section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are consolidated, in view of the fact that those provisions have been superseded by section 744<em>l</em> of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., in connection with other provisions of the act of June 23, 1934, ch. 736, 48 Stat. 1211.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of section 744<em>l</em> of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing replacement of the prison industries working capital fund by the prison industries fund was omitted, as executed. That provision superseded section 744d of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which author<!-- PDFPage:801 -->ized creation of the prison industries working capital fund and the first sentence of section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., directing that certain funds should be credited to the consolidated prison industries working capital fund.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;or received from the sale of the products or by-products of such Industries, or for the services of Federal prisoners,&rdquo; was inserted to make the first paragraph of this section complete, and required the Federal Prison Industries to account for all moneys under its control.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;in the repair, alteration, erection and maintenance of industrial buildings and equipment&rdquo; and &ldquo;under rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General in paying compensation to inmates employed in any industry, or performing outstanding services in industrial operations&rdquo; were inserted in part to conform to administrative construction, and in part to provide greater flexibility in the operation of Prison Industries. Much friction was caused by the inability of Prison Industries to compensate inmates whose services in operating the utilities of the institution were most necessary but which were uncompensated while those prisoners who worked in the Industries received compensation. This inequitable situation is corrected by the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;in performing the duties imposed by this chapter&rdquo; were substituted for the words &ldquo;for the purposes enumerated in sections 744a&ndash;744h of this title,&rdquo; since the provisions with regard to prison industries now appear in this chapter. The general provisions as to use of the fund supersede the more specific provisions of section 744f of said title (enacted earlier).</p>
<p class="note-body">A reference to the Federal Employees&rsquo; Compensation Act as appeared in the 1934 act was substituted for the reference to specific sections of title 5. The word &ldquo;law&rdquo; was substituted for the reference to sections in title 31 since translation of the reference in the 1934 act was not practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">Remaining provisions of said section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to authorization of appropriations, were omitted as unnecessary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) As approved by the board of directors, Federal Prison Industries, to such extent and in such amounts as are provided in appropriations Acts, is authorized to issue its obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Treasury, in the Secretary's discretion, may purchase or agree to purchase any such obligations, except that the aggregate amount of obligations issued by Federal Prison Industries under this paragraph that are outstanding at any time may not exceed 25 percent of the net worth of the corporation.
