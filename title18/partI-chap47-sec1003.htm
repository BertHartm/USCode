<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;79 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;34, 35 Stat. 1095).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;prize money&rdquo; were deleted on the ground that they are an anachronism and were so before 1909. (See reviser's note under section 915 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's note to sections 641 and 645 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The maximum term of &ldquo;five years&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;ten years&rdquo; and &ldquo;$10,000&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;$5,000&rdquo; as being more in harmony with punishment provision of similar sections. (See reviser's note under section 1001 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in phraseology were made.</p>
