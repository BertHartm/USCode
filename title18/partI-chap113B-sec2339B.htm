<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) international terrorism is a serious and deadly problem that threatens the vital interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Constitution confers upon Congress the power to punish crimes against the law of nations and to carry out the treaty obligations of the United States, and therefore Congress may by law impose penalties relating to the provision of material support to foreign organizations engaged in terrorist activity;</p>
