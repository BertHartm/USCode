<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Scope.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General</em>. This rule governs the procedure and practice for the conduct of proceedings involving misdemeanors and other petty offenses, and for appeals to district judges in such cases tried by United States magistrate judges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Applicability of Other Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</em>. In proceedings concerning petty offenses for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed the court may follow such provisions of these rules as it deems appropriate, to the extent not inconsistent with this rule. In all other proceedings the other rules govern except as specifically provided in this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Definition</em>. The term &ldquo;petty offenses for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed&rdquo; as used in this rule, means any petty offenses as defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect;19 as to which the court determines, that, in the event of conviction, no sentence of imprisonment will actually be imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Pretrial Procedures.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Trial Document</em>. The trial of a misdemeanor may proceed on an indictment, information, or complaint or, in the case of a petty offense, on a citation or violation notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Initial Appearance</em>. At the defendant's initial appearance on a misdemeanor or other petty offense charge, the court shall inform the defendant of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the charge, and the maximum possible penalties provided by law, including payment of a special assessment under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3013, and restitution under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3663;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the right to retain counsel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the right to request the appointment of counsel if the defendant is unable to obtain counsel, unless the charge is a petty offense for which an appointment of counsel is not required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the right to remain silent and that any statement made by the defendant may be used against the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the right to trial, judgment, and sentencing before a district judge, unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the charge is a Class B misdemeanor motor-vehicle offense, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the defendant consents to trial, judgment, and sentencing before a magistrate judge;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the right to trial by jury before either a United States magistrate judge or a district judge, unless the charge is a petty offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the right to a preliminary examination in accordance with 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060, and the general circumstances under which the defendant may secure pretrial release, if the defendant is held in custody and charged with a misdemeanor other than a petty offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Consent and Arraignment.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Plea Before a United States Magistrate Judge</cap-smallcap>. A magistrate judge shall take the defendant's plea in a Class B misdemeanor charging a motor-vehicle offense, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction. In every other misdemeanor case, a magistrate judge may take the plea only if the defendant consents either in writing or orally on the record to be tried before the magistrate judge and specifically waives trial before a district judge. The defendant may plead not guilty, guilty, or with the consent of the magistrate judge, nolo contendere.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Failure to Consent</cap-smallcap>. In a misdemeanor case&mdash;other than a Class B misdemeanor charging a motor-vehicle offense, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction&mdash;magistrate judge shall order the defendant to appear before a district judge for further proceedings on notice, unless the defendant consents to trial before the magistrate judge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Procedures Applicable Only to Petty Offenses for Which No Sentence of <!-- PDFPage:154 -->Imprisonment Will Be Imposed</cap-smallcap>. With respect to petty offenses for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed, the following additional procedures are applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere</em>. No plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be accepted unless the court is satisfied that the defendant understands the nature of the charge and the maximum possible penalties provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Waiver of Venue for Plea and Sentence</em>. A defendant who is arrested, held, or present in a district other than that in which the indictment, information, complaint, citation or violation notice is pending against that defendant may state in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere, to waive venue and trial in the district in which the proceeding is pending, and to consent to disposition of the case in the district in which that defendant was arrested, is held, or is present. Unless the defendant thereafter pleads not guilty, the prosecution shall be had as if venue were in such district, and notice of the same shall be given to the magistrate judge in the district where the proceeding was originally commenced. The defendant's statement of a desire to plead guilty or nolo contendere is not admissible against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Sentence</em>. The court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard in mitigation.

Local rules may make provision for increases in fixed sums not to exceed the maximum fine which could be imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Notice to Appear</em>. If a defendant fails to pay a fixed sum, request a hearing, or appear in response to a citation or violation notice, the clerk or a magistrate judge may issue a notice for the defendant to appear before the court on a date certain. The notice may also afford the defendant an additional opportunity to pay a fixed sum in lieu of appearance, and shall be served upon the defendant by mailing a copy to the defendant's last known address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Summons or Warrant</em>. Upon an indictment or a showing by one of the other documents specified in subdivision (b)(1) of probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, the court may issue an arrest warrant or, if no warrant is requested by the attorney for the prosecution, a summons. The showing of probable cause shall be made in writing upon oath or under penalty for perjury, but the affiant need not appear before the court.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Interlocutory Appeal</cap-smallcap>. A decision or order by a magistrate judge which, if made by a district judge, could be appealed by the government or defendant under any provision of law, shall be subject to an appeal to a district judge provided such appeal is taken within 10 days of the entry of the decision or order. An appeal shall be taken by filing with the clerk of court a statement specifying the decision or order from which an appeal is taken and by serving a copy of the statement upon the adverse party, personally or by mail, and by filing a copy with the magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Appeal From Conviction or Sentence</cap-smallcap>.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1990</h4>
<p class="note-body">This new rule is largely a restatement of the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Misdemeanors before United States Magistrates which were promulgated in 1980 to replace the Rules for the Trial of Minor Offenses before United States Magistrates (1970). The Committee believed that a new single rule should be incorporated into the Rules of Criminal Procedure where those charged with its execution could readily locate it and realize its relationship with the other Rules. A number of technical changes have been made throughout the rule and unless otherwise noted, no substantive changes were intended in those amendments. The Committee envisions no major changes in the way in which the trial of misdemeanors and petty offenses are currently handled.</p>
<p class="note-body">The title of the rule has been changed by deleting the phrase &ldquo;Before United States Magistrates&rdquo; to indicate that this rule may be used by district judges as well as magistrates. The phrase &ldquo;and Petty Offenses&rdquo; has been added to the title and elsewhere throughout the rule because the term &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; does not include an &ldquo;infraction.&rdquo; <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3559(a). A petty offense, however, is defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect;19 as a Class B misdemeanor, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction, with limitations on fines of no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for an organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em> is an amended version of current Magistrates Rule 1. Deletion of the phrase &ldquo;before United States Magistrates under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401&rdquo; in Rule 1(a) will enable district judges to use the abbreviated procedures of this rule. Consistent with that change, the term &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; is amended to read &ldquo;the court,&rdquo; wherever appropriate throughout the rule, to indicate that both judges and magistrates may use the rule. The last sentence in (a)(1) has been amended to reflect that the rule also governs an appeal from a magistrate's decision to . An appeal from a district judge's decision would be governed by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Subdivision (a)(2) rephrases prior language in Magistrate Rule 1(b). Subdivision (a)(3) adds a statutory reference to 18 U.S.C. &sect;19, which defines a petty offense as a &ldquo;Class B misdemeanor, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction&rdquo; with the $5,000 and $10,000 fine limitations noted <em>supra</em>. The phrase &ldquo;regardless of the penalty authorized by law&rdquo; has been deleted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em> is an amended version of current Magistrates Rule 2. The last sentence in current Rule 2(a) has been deleted because 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(a), provides that a magistrate will have jurisdiction to try misdemeanor cases when specially designated to do so by the district court or courts served by the Magistrate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)</em> reflects the standard rights advisements currently included in Magistrates Rule 2 with several amendments. Subdivision (b)(2)(A) specifically requires that the defendant be advised of all penalties which may be imposed upon conviction, including specifically a special assessment and restitution. A number of technical, nonsubstantive, changes have been made in the contents of advisement of rights. A substantive change is reflected in subdivision (b)(2)(G), currently Magistrates Rule 2(b)(7), and (8). That rule currently provides that, unless the prosecution is on an indictment or information, a defendant who is charged with a misdemeanor other than a petty offense has a right to a preliminary hearing, if the defendant does not consent to be tried by the magistrate. As amended, only a defendant in custody has a right to a preliminary hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(3)(A)</em> is based upon Magistrates Rule 2(c) and has been amended by deleting the last sentence, which provides that trial may occur within 30 days &ldquo;upon written consent of the defendant.&rdquo; The change is warranted because the Speedy Trial Act does not apply to petty offenses. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3172(2). Subdivision (b)(3)(B), &ldquo;Failure to Consent,&rdquo; currently appears in Magistrates Rule 3(a). The first sentence has been amended to make it applicable to all misdemeanor and petty offense defendants who fail to consent. The last sentence of Rule 3(a) has been deleted entirely. Because the clerk is responsible for all district court case files, including those for misdemeanor and petty offense cases tried by magistrates, it is not necessary to state that the file be transmitted to the clerk of court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em> is an amended version of current Magistrates Rule 3 with the exception of Rule 3(a), which, as noted <em>supra</em> is now located in subdivision (b)(3)(B) of the new rule. The phrase &ldquo;petty offense for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed&rdquo; has been deleted because the heading for subdivision (c) limits its application to those petty offenses. The Committee recognizes that subdivision (c)(2) might result in attempted forum shopping. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shaw</em>, 467 F. Supp. 86 (W.D. La. 1979), <em>affm'd</em>, 615 F. 2d 251 (5th Cir. 1980). In order to maintain a streamlined and less formal procedure which is consistent with the remainder of the Rule, subdivision (c)(2) does not require the formal &ldquo;consent&rdquo; of the United States Attorneys involved before a waiver of venue may be accomplished. <em>Cf</em>. Rule 20 (Transfer From the District for Plea and Sentence). The Rule specifically envisions that there will be communication and coordination between the two districts involved. To that end, reasonable efforts should be made to contact the United States Attorney in the district in which the charges were instituted. Subdivision (c)(4), formerly Rule 3(d), now specifically provides that the defendant be advised of the right to appeal the sentence. This subdivision is also amended to provide for advising the defendant of the right to appeal a sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act when the defendant is sentenced following a plea of guilty. Both amendments track the language of Rule 32(a)(2), as amended by the Sentencing Reform Act.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em> is an amended version of Magistrates Rule 4. The amendments are technical in nature and no substantive change is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em> consists of the first sentence of Magistrates Rule 5. The second sentence of that Rule was deleted as being inconsistent with 28 U.S.C. &sect;753(b) which gives the court discretion to decide how the proceedings will be recorded. The third sentence is deleted to preclude routine waivers of a verbatim record and to insure that all petty offenses are recorded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (f)</em> replaces Magistrates Rule 6 and simply incorporates by reference Rule 33.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (g)</em> is an amended version of Magistrates Rule 7. Because the new rule may be used by both magistrates and judges, subdivision (g)(1) was added to make it clear that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure govern any appeal in a case tried by a district judge pursuant to the new rule. Subdivision (g)(2)(B), based upon Magistrates Rule 7(b), now provides for appeal of a sentence by a magistrate and is thus consistent with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3742(f). Finally, subdivision (g)(3) is based upon Magistrates Rule 7(d) but has been amended to provide that a stay of execution is applicable, if an appeal is taken from a sentence as well as from a conviction. This change is consistent with the recent amendment of Rule 38 by the Sentencing Reform Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new rule does not include Magistrates Rules 8 and 9. Rule 8 has been deleted because the subject of local rules is covered in Rule 57. Rule 9, which defined a petty offense, is now covered in 18 U.S.C. &sect;19.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive changes are intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, Sec. 202, amended 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(b) and 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(a) to remove the requirement that a defendant must consent to a trial before a magistrate judge in a petty offense that is a class B misdemeanor charging a motor vehicle offense, a class C misdemeanor, or an infraction. Section 202 also changed 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(b) to provide that in all other misdemeanor cases, the defendant may consent to trial either orally on the record or in writing. The amendments to Rule 58(b)(2) and (3) conform the rule to the new statutory language and include minor stylistic changes.</p>
