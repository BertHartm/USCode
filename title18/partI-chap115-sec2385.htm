<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 10, 11, and 13 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Section 13 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which contained the punishment provisions applicable to sections 10 and 11 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was combined with section 11 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and added to this section.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In first paragraph, words &ldquo;the Government of the United States or the government of any State, Territory, District or possession thereof, or the government of any political subdivision therein&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;any government in the United States&rdquo;.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In second and third paragraphs, word &ldquo;such&rdquo; was inserted after &ldquo;any&rdquo; and before &ldquo;government&rdquo;, and words &ldquo;in the United States&rdquo; which followed &ldquo;government&rdquo; were omitted.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In view of these changes, the provisions of subsection (b) of section 10 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which defined the term &ldquo;government in the United States&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary.  </p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to conspiracy to commit any of the prohibited acts was omitted as covered by the general conspiracy provision, incorporated in section 371 of this title. (See reviser's note under that section.)  </p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; which preceded &ldquo;be fined&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage, as punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.  </p>
<p class="note-body">The phraseology was considerably changed to effect consolidation but without any change of substance.  </p>
