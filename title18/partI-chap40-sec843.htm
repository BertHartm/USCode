<!-- PDFPage:175 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) Upon the filing of a proper application and payment of the prescribed fee, and subject to the provisions of this chapter and other applicable laws, the Attorney General shall issue to such applicant the appropriate license or permit if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the applicant has in a State premises from which he conducts or intends to conduct business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) the Secretary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#843_1_target" name="843_1">1</a></sup> verifies by inspection or, if the application is for an original limited permit or the first or second renewal of such a permit, by such other means as the Secretary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#843_1_target" name="843_1">1</a></sup> determines appropriate, that the applicant has a place of storage for explosive materials which meets such standards of public safety and security against theft as the Attorney General by regulations shall prescribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an applicant for the renewal of a limited permit if the Secretary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#843_1_target" name="843_1">1</a></sup> has verified, by inspection within the preceding 3 years, the matters described in subparagraph (A) with respect to the applicant; and</p>

The Secretary's&nbsp;<sup><a href="#843_2_target" name="843_2">2</a></sup> action under this subsection may be reviewed only as provided in subsection (e)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Any person whose application is denied or whose license or permit is revoked shall receive a written notice from the Attorney General stating the specific grounds upon which such denial or revocation is based. Any notice of a revocation of a license or permit shall be given to the holder of such license or permit prior to or concurrently with the effective date of the revocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Attorney General denies an application for, or revokes a license, or permit, he shall, upon request by the aggrieved party, promptly hold a hearing to review his denial or revocation.
