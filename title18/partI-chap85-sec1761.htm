<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 396a and 396b of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Each section related to the same subject matter and defined the same offense. Section 396a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was enacted later and superseded section 396b of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons aiding, causing or assisting was omitted. Such persons are principals under section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to states, territories, specific places, etc., were omitted. This was made possible by insertion of words &ldquo;interstate commerce or from any foreign country into the United States,&rdquo; and by definitive section 10 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) was rewritten to eliminate ambiguity and uncertainty by expressly making the exceptive language apply to the entire chapter and by permitting State institutions to manufacture goods for the Federal Government and the District of Columbia and vice versa. In such subsections, the words &ldquo;penal and correctional&rdquo; and &ldquo;penal or correctional,&rdquo; preceding &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; and &ldquo;institution,&rdquo; respectively, were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes in phraseology were made.</p>
