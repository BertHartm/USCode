<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 53 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents (Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, &sect;34, 28 Stat. 605).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;on conviction before any court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until there has been a conviction before a competent tribunal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;in the penitentiary&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage as section 4082 of this title commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The minimum punishment provision &ldquo;for a term of not less than one nor&rdquo; was omitted in keeping with policy of codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.</p>
<p class="note-body">The offense described in this section involves no moral turpitude, and therefore the punishment provisions were reduced from 5 years to 1 year, so that the stigma of a felony would not attach to an offender. The fine was increased from $500 to $1,000 as more proportionate to the 1-year term of imprisonment. (See classification of felony and misdemeanor in section 1 of this title and note thereunder.)</p>

<p class="note-body">1994&mdash;Pub. L. 103&ndash;322 substituted &ldquo;fined under this title&rdquo; for &ldquo;fined not more than $1,000&rdquo; in second par.</p>
