<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In a criminal case an appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision, judgment, or order of a district court dismissing an indictment or information or granting a new trial after verdict or judgment, as to any one or more counts, except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">An appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court suppressing or excluding evidence or requiring the return of seized property in a criminal proceeding, not made after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict or finding on an indictment or information, if the United States attorney certifies to the district court that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">An appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order, entered by a district court of the United States, granting the release of a person charged with or convicted of an offense, or denying a motion for revocation of, or modification of the conditions of, a decision or order granting release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The appeal in all such cases shall be taken within thirty days after the decision, judgment or order has been rendered and shall be diligently prosecuted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;682 (Mar. 2, 1907, ch. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;291, 36 Stat. 1167; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, &sect;1, 45 Stat. 54; May 9, 1942, ch. 295, &sect;1, 56 Stat. 271).</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;dismissing&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;sustaining a motion to dismiss&rdquo; in two places for conciseness and clarity, there being no difference in effect of a decision of dismissal whether made on motion or by the court sua sponte.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made to conform to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The final sentence authorizing promulgation of rules is omitted as redundant.</p>

<p class="note-body">1968&mdash;Pub. L. 90&ndash;351 inserted eighth par. providing for an appeal by the United States from decisions sustaining motions to suppress evidence and substituted in tenth par. &ldquo;defendant shall be released in accordance with chapter 207 of this title&rdquo; for &ldquo;defendant shall be admitted to bail on his own recognizance&rdquo;, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body">1949&mdash;Act May 24, 1949, substituted &ldquo;invalidity&rdquo; for &ldquo;validity&rdquo; after &ldquo;upon the&rdquo; in second par., and conformed language of fifth, tenth, and eleventh pars. to the changed nomenclature of the courts.</p>
