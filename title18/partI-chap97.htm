<p class="note-body">This chapter does not include motor busses, interstate trucking facilities or airplanes within the protection of existing law. Motor busses and trucks already carry a huge amount of interstate commerce. It is reasonable to presume that much interstate freight and express will soon be carried by air.</p>
<p class="note-body">Attention is directed to the consideration of the extension of the laws now applicable only to railroads to these other interstate facilities. 80th Congress House Report No. 304.</p>
