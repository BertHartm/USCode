In order to carry out the purpose of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to enter into or upon any property where explosive materials have been used, are suspected of having been used, or have been found in an otherwise unauthorized location. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as modifying or otherwise affecting in any way the investigative authority of any other Federal agency. In addition to any other investigatory authority they have with respect to violations of provisions of this chapter, the Attorney General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, together with the Secretary, shall have authority to conduct investigations with respect to violations of subsection (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i) of section 844 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary is authorized to establish a national repository of information on incidents involving arson and the suspected criminal misuse of explosives.

The repository shall also contain information on incidents voluntarily reported to the Secretary by State and local authorities.</p>
