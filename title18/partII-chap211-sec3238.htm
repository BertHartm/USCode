<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 102 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, &sect;41, 36 Stat. 1100).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;begun or&rdquo; were inserted to clarify scope of this section and section 3237 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section is similar to section 219 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse, providing in part that unlawful issuance of passports may be prosecuted in the district where the offender may be arrested or in custody. Said provision is therefore omitted as covered by this section. The remaining provisions of said section 219 are incorporated in section 1541 of this title.</p>
