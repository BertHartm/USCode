<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;82, 87, 100, 101 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;&sect;35, 36, 47, 48, 35 Stat. 1095, 1096&ndash;1098; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197; Nov. 22, 1943, ch. 302, 57 Stat. 591.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 82, 87, 100, and 101 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Changes necessary to effect the consolidation were made. Words &ldquo;or shall willfully injure or commit any depredation against&rdquo; were taken <!-- PDFPage:135 -->from said section 82 so as to confine it to embezzlement or theft.</p>
<p class="note-body">The quoted language, rephrased in the present tense, appears in section 1361 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;in a jail&rdquo; which followed &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; and preceded &ldquo;for not more than one year&rdquo; in said section 82, were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Language relating to receiving stolen property is from said section 101.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or aid in concealing&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 2 of this title. Procedural language at end of said section 101 &ldquo;and such person may be tried either before or after the conviction of the principal offender&rdquo; was transferred to and rephrased in section 3435 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder&rdquo; in said section 82 were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in section 6 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions for fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than 1 year for an offense involving $100 or less and for fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than 10 years, or both, for an offense involving a greater amount were written into this section as more in conformity with the later congressional policy expressed in sections 82 and 87 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., than the nongraduated penalties of sections 100 and 101 of said title 18.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the purchasing power of the dollar is less than it was when $50 was the figure which determined whether larceny was petit larceny or grand larceny, the sum $100 was substituted as more consistent with modern values.</p>
<p class="note-body">The meaning of &ldquo;value&rdquo; in the last paragraph of the revised section is written to conform with that provided in section 2311 of this title by inserting the words &ldquo;face, par, or&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section incorporates the recommendation of Paul W. Hyatt, president, board of commissioners of the Idaho State Bar Association, that sections 82 and 100 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., be combined and simplified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, with respect to section 101 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., this section meets the suggestion of P. F. Herrick, United States attorney for Puerto Rico, that the punishment provision of said section be amended to make the offense a misdemeanor where the amount involved is $50 or less.</p>

Words &ldquo;banks the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;insured banks&rdquo; in second paragraph, for the same reason.</p>
<p class="note-body">Punishment provision harmonized with that of section 656 of this title. (See also, reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whoever, being an officer, director, agent or employee of, or connected in any capacity with any Federal Reserve bank, member bank, depository institution holding company, national bank, insured bank, branch or agency of a foreign bank, or organization operating under section 25 or section 25(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#656_1_target" name="656_1">1</a></sup> of the Federal Reserve Act, or a receiver of a national bank, insured bank, branch, agency, or organization or any agent or employee of the receiver, or a Federal Reserve Agent, or an agent or employee of a Federal Reserve Agent or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, embezzles, abstracts, purloins or willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of such bank, branch, agency, or organization or holding company or any moneys, funds, assets or securities intrusted to the custody or care of such bank, branch, agency, or organization, or holding company or to the custody or care of any such agent, officer, director, employee or receiver, shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both; but if the amount embezzled, abstracted, purloined or misapplied does not exceed $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;national bank&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;national banking association&rdquo;; &ldquo;member bank&rdquo; means and includes any national bank, state bank, or bank and trust company which has become a member of one of the Federal Reserve banks; &ldquo;insured bank&rdquo; includes any bank, banking association, trust company, savings bank, or other banking institution, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and the term &ldquo;branch or agency of a foreign bank&rdquo; means a branch or agency described in section 20(9) of this title.

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 592, 597 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. 5209; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;22(i), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, &sect;3, 48 Stat. 1107; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, &sect;7, 40 Stat. 972; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;316, 49 Stat. 712).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was separated into three sections the first of which, embracing provisions relating to embezzlement, abstracting, purloining, or willfully misapplying moneys, funds, or credits, constitutes part of the basis for this section. Of the other two sections, one section, 334 of this title, relates only to the issuance and circulation of Federal Reserve notes and the other, section 1005 of this title, to false entries or the wrongful issue of bank obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The original section, containing more than 500 words, was verbose, diffuse, redundant, and complicated. The enumeration of banks affected is repeated eight times. The revised section without changing in any way the meaning or substance of existing law, clarifies, condenses, and combines related provisions largely rewritten in matters of style.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;national bank&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;national banking association,&rdquo; the terms being synonymous by definition of section 221 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, written into the last paragraph of this section. This change made possible the use of the term &ldquo;such bank&rdquo; in substitution for the words &ldquo;such Federal Reserve bank, member bank, or such national banking association, or insured bank,&rdquo; in each of seven instances.</p>
<p class="note-body">The special and separate provisions of the original section relating to embezzlement by national bank receivers or Federal Reserve agents are readily combined in the revised section by including these officers in the initial enumeration of persons at whom the act is directed and by inserting the word &ldquo;purloins&rdquo; after &ldquo;embezzles, abstracts,&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;or any moneys, funds, assets, or securities intrusted to the custody or care,&rdquo; following the words &ldquo;of such bank&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last paragraph of the revised section includes the definitions of sections 221 and 264(c) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, made applicable by express provision of the original section. These were written in, with only such changes of phraseology as were necessary, in order to make the revised section complete and self-contained. For meaning of &ldquo;bank,&rdquo; as <!-- PDFPage:142 -->used in bank robbery statute, see section 2113 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 597 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, likewise was separated into two parts, one of which was combined with the embezzlement provisions of said section 592 to form this section. The other part was combined with the related provisions of said section 592 to form section 1005 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">It will be noted that section 597 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was limited to &ldquo;Whoever, being connected in any capacity with a Federal Reserve bank&rdquo;; that it enumerated &ldquo;note, debenture, bond, or other obligation, or draft, mortgage, judgment, or decree&rdquo;; and that it stipulated punishment by fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body">In combining these provisions, the words &ldquo;or connected in any capacity&rdquo; were written into the new section after the words &ldquo;employee of,&rdquo; thus making them applicable not only to Federal Reserve banks but to the other banks as well. The phrase of section 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, &ldquo;or who, without such authority, issues or puts forth any certificate of deposit, draws any order or bill of exchange, makes any acceptance, assigns any note, bond, draft, bill of exchange, mortgage, judgment, or decree,&rdquo; was modified to include the enumeration of like obligations in section 597 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and to read as follows: &ldquo;whoever without such authority makes, draws, issues, puts forth, or assigns any certificate of deposit, draft, order, bill of exchange, acceptance, note, debenture, bond, or other obligation or mortgage, judgment, or decree&rdquo;. (See section 1005 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">As thus changed the new section is clear, simple, and unambiguous. The very slight changes of substance that have been noted, were unavoidable if the two sections were to be combined. Without combination any constructive revision of these duplicitous and redundant provisions was impossible. It is believed that the revised sections adequately and correctly represent the intent of Congress as the same can be gathered from the overlapping and confusing enactments. At any rate, the severest criticism of the revised sections is that a person connected with a Federal Reserve bank who violates these sections can at most be punished by a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment of 5 years, or both, whereas under section 597 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, he might have been fined $10,000 or imprisoned 5 years, or both. Obviously an embezzler will rarely be financially able to pay even a $5,000 fine even where such fine is imposed. Certainly if it is an adequate fine for a national bank president it is not too disproportionate for a person &ldquo;connected in any capacity with a Federal Reserve bank&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes under sections 641, 645 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed without conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;In any district court of the United States&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary since section 3231 of this title gives the district courts jurisdiction of criminal prosecution.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on sections 1026(b) and 1514(c) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and sections 264(u), 984, 1121, 1138d(c), 1311, 1441(c), 1467(c), and 1731(c) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(c) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;12B(u), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, &sect;8, 48 Stat. 178; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;31, fourth paragraph, 39 Stat. 382; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;211(a), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, &sect;2, 42 Stat. 1459; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, &sect;216(a), 42 Stat. 1471; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, &sect;16(c), 47 Stat. 11; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, &sect;21(c), 47 Stat. 738; Mar. 27, 1933, Ex. Ord. No. 6084; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, &sect;8(c), 48 Stat. 135; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, &sect;64(c), 48 Stat. 268; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, &sect;13, 48 Stat. 347; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, &sect;512(c), 48 Stat. 1265; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;101, 49 Stat. 701; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, &sect;52(b), 50 Stat. 532; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, &sect;514(c), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, &sect;3, 60 Stat. 1064).</p>
<p class="note-body">Each of the eleven sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions relating to embezzlement, false entries, and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligations with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">These were separated and the embezzlement and misapplication provisions of all form the basis of this section, and with one exception the remaining provisions of each section forming the basis for section 1006 of this title. The sole exception was that portion of said section 616(c) of title 15 as to the disclosure of information which now forms section 1904 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section condenses and simplifies the constituent provisions without change of substance except as in this note indicated.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment in each section was the same except that in section 1026(b) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, the maximum fine was $5,000. The revised section adopts the $5,000 maximum. (For same penalty covering similar offense, see section 656 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes to sections 641&ndash;645 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The enumeration of &ldquo;moneys, funds, credits, securities, or other things of value&rdquo; does not occur in any one of the original sections but is an adequate, composite enumeration of the instruments mentioned in each.</p>
<p class="note-body">References to persons aiding and abetting contained in sections 984, 1121, 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were omitted as unnecessary, such persons being made principals by section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; is used in sections 1121 and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, with reference to Federal intermediate banks and agricultural credit corporations, and is undoubtedly embraced in the term &ldquo;connected in any capacity with,&rdquo; but the phrase &ldquo;and whoever, being a receiver of any such institution&rdquo; was inserted in this section to obviate all doubt as to its comprehensive scope.</p>
<p class="note-body">The suggestion has been made that &ldquo;private examiners&rdquo; should be included. These undoubtedly are covered by the words &ldquo;connected in any capacity with.&rdquo; (See also section 655 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;or any department or agency of the United States&rdquo; was inserted in each revised section in order to clarify the sweeping provisions against fraudulent acts and to obviate any possibility of ambiguity by reason of the omission of specific agencies named in the constituent sections. (See section 6 of this title defining &ldquo;department and agency.&rdquo; For other verbal changes and deletions see reviser's note under section 656 of this title.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 1026(c) and 1514(d) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and section 1138d(d) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (June 16, 1933, ch. 98, &sect;64, 48 Stat. 269; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, &sect;13, 48 Stat. 347; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, &sect;52(c), 50 Stat. 532; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, &sect;514(d), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, &sect;3, 60 Stat. 1064).</p>
<p class="note-body">To avoid reference to another section the words &ldquo;the Farm Credit Administration, any Federal intermediate credit bank, the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Farmers&rsquo; Home Corporation, or any production credit corporation or corporation in which a production credit corporation holds stock, any regional agricultural credit corporation, or any bank for cooperatives&rdquo; were substituted for the words &ldquo;or any corporation referred to in subsection (a) of this section.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provision was completely rewritten. The $2,000 fine of section 1026(c) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the 2-year penalty of that section, section 1514(d) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 1138(d) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were incongruous in juxtaposition with other sections of this chapter and were therefore increased to $5,000 and 5 years. (See sections 656 and 657 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;409, 410, 411 (Feb. 13, 1913, ch. 50, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 37 Stat. 670; Feb. 13, 1913, ch. 50, &sect;3, as added Jan. 28, 1925, ch. 102, 43 Stat. 794; Jan. 28, 1925, ch. 102, 43 Stat. 793, 794; Jan. 21, 1933, ch. 16, 47 Stat. 773, 774; July 24, 1946, ch. 606, 60 Stat. 656.)</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates sections 409, 410, and 411 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. First clause of said section 409 was incorporated in section 2117 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the paragraph immediately preceding the last paragraph the words &ldquo;and to which&rdquo; were added to obviate an inadvertent and incongruous omission in the enactment of act July 24, 1946, ch. 606, &sect;3, 60 Stat. 657. This is in harmony with corrective legislation pending before the Eightieth Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definitions of &ldquo;station house&rdquo;, &ldquo;depot&rdquo;, &ldquo;wagon&rdquo;, &ldquo;automobile&rdquo;, &ldquo;truck&rdquo;, or &ldquo;other vehicle&rdquo;, contained in said section 409 of title 18, are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The smaller punishment for an offense involving $100 or less was added. (See reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.) This improvement was suggested by United States Attorney P. F. Herrick, of Puerto Rico. (See reviser's note under section 641 of this title.)</p>

<p class="note-body">1966&mdash;Pub. L. 89&ndash;654 substituted &ldquo;shipments by carrier&rdquo; for &ldquo;baggage, express, or freight&rdquo; in section catchline, inserted &ldquo;pipeline system&rdquo; and &ldquo;tank or storage facility&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;freight, express, or other property&rdquo; for &ldquo;freight or express&rdquo; in par. 1, provided in par. 8 that the removal of property from a pipeline system which extends interstate shall be prima facie evidence of the interstate character of the shipment of the property, and, in par. 9, prohibited any construction which indicated an intent on the part of Congress to occupy the field to the exclusion of State laws or to invalidate inconsistent State provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">1949&mdash;Act May 24, 1949, inserted &ldquo;embezzled or&rdquo; before &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; in second par., and substituted &ldquo;whoever&rdquo; for &ldquo;who&rdquo; before &ldquo;buys&rdquo; in fourth par.</p>
