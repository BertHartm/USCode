<p class="note-body">Section 594 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, first paragraph, related to national-bank examiners and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation examiners, and provided punishment for several offenses including the offense of performing services, for compensation, other than their regular duties. Section 656a of said title 12 is authority for the designation &ldquo;farm credit examiner&rdquo; included in this section, and section 1093 of said title authorizes farm credit examiners to conduct examinations in connection with contemplated transactions of Federal intermediate credit banks, to which section 1124 of said title relates.</p>

They do not specifically provide punishment for violation of such prohibition, but the provisions of said section 594 of said title, relating to national-bank examiners and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation examiners, which does provide punishment for the same offense, are extended to the former two types of examiners by sections 952 and 1243 thereof.</p>
