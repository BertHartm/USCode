<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule generally states existing law and practice, 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial); <em>United States v. Simon</em> (E.D.Pa.), 248 F. 980; <em>United States v. Maresca</em> (S.D.N.Y.), 266 F. 713, 719&ndash;721. It eliminates, however, the requirement of conformity to State law as to the form and sufficiency of the complaint. See, also, rule 57(b).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment deletes the reference to &ldquo;commissioner or other officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the United States&rdquo; and substitute therefor &ldquo;magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The change is editorial in nature to conform the language of the rule to the recently enacted Federal Magistrates Act. The term &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; is defined in rule 54.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 3 is amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment makes one change in practice. Currently, Rule 3 requires the complaint to be sworn before a &ldquo;magistrate judge,&rdquo; which under current Rule 54 could include a state or local judicial officer. Revised Rule 1 no longer includes state and local officers in the definition of magistrate judges for the purposes of these rules. Instead, the definition includes only United States magistrate judges. Rule 3 requires that the complaint be made before a United States magistrate judge or before a state or local officer. The revised rule does, however, make a change to reflect prevailing practice and the outcome desired by the Committee&mdash;that the procedure take place before a <em>federal</em> judicial officer if one is reasonably available. As noted in Rule 1(c), where the rules, such as Rule 3, authorize a magistrate judge to act, any other federal judge may act.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 4. Arrest Warrant or Summons on a Complaint</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Issuance.</strong> If the complaint or one or more affidavits filed with the complaint establish probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it, the judge must issue an arrest warrant to an officer authorized to execute it. At the request of an attorney for the government, the judge must issue a summons, instead of a warrant, to a person authorized to serve it. A judge may issue more than one warrant or summons on the same complaint. If a defendant fails to appear in response to a summons, a judge may, and upon request of an attorney for the government must, issue a warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Form.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>Warrant.</em></strong> A warrant must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) contain the defendant's name or, if it is unknown, a name or description by which the defendant can be identified with reasonable certainty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) describe the offense charged in the complaint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) command that the defendant be arrested and brought without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge or, if none is reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) be signed by a judge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Summons.</em></strong> A summons must be in the same form as a warrant except that it must require the defendant to appear before a magistrate judge at a stated time and place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Execution or Service, and Return.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>Whom.</em></strong> Only a marshal or other authorized officer may execute a warrant. Any person authorized to serve a summons in a federal civil action may serve a summons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Location.</em></strong> A warrant may be executed, or a summons served, within the jurisdiction of the United States or anywhere else a federal statute authorizes an arrest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(3) <em>Manner.</em></strong></p>
<!-- PDFPage:17 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A warrant is executed by arresting the defendant. Upon arrest, an officer possessing the warrant must show it to the defendant. If the officer does not possess the warrant, the officer must inform the defendant of the warrant's existence and of the offense charged and, at the defendant's request, must show the warrant to the defendant as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A summons is served on an individual defendant:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by delivering a copy to the defendant personally; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by leaving a copy at the defendant's residence or usual place of abode with a person of suitable age and discretion residing at that location and by mailing a copy to the defendant's last known address.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A summons is served on an organization by delivering a copy to an officer, to a managing or general agent, or to another agent appointed or legally authorized to receive service of process. A copy must also be mailed to the organization's last known address within the district or to its principal place of business elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(4) <em>Return.</em></strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) After executing a warrant, the officer must return it to the judge before whom the defendant is brought in accordance with Rule 5. At the request of an attorney for the government, an unexecuted warrant must be brought back to and canceled by a magistrate judge or, if none is reasonably available, by a state or local judicial officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The person to whom a summons was delivered for service must return it on or before the return day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) At the request of an attorney for the government, a judge may deliver an unexecuted warrant, an unserved summons, or a copy of the warrant or summons to the marshal or other authorized person for execution or service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The rule states the existing law relating to warrants issued by commissioner or other magistrate. United States Constitution, Amendment IV; 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The provision for summons is new, although a summons has been customarily used against corporate defendants, 28 U.S.C. 377 [now 1651] (Power to issue writs); <em>United States v. John Kelso Co</em>., 86 F. 304 (N.D.Cal., 1898). See also, <em>Albrecht v. United States</em>, 273 U.S. 1, 8 (1927). The use of the summons in criminal cases is sanctioned by many States, among them Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and others. See A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), Commentaries to secs. 12, 13, and 14. The use of the summons is permitted in England by 11 & 12 Vict., c. 42, sec. 1 (1848). More general use of a summons in place of a warrant was recommended by the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, <em>Report on Criminal Procedure</em> (1931) 47. The Uniform Arrest Act, proposed by the Interstate Commission on Crime, provides for a summons. Warner, 28 Va.L.R. 315. See also, Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild, R. 1, 6.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The provision for the issuance of additional warrants on the same complaint embodies the practice heretofore followed in some districts. It is desirable from a practical standpoint, since when a complaint names several defendants, it may be preferable to issue a separate warrant as to each in order to facilitate service and return, especially if the defendants are apprehended at different times and places. Berge, 42 Mich.L.R. 353, 356.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Failure to respond to a summons is not a contempt of court, but is ground for issuing a warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). Compare Rule 9(b) and forms of warrant and summons, Appendix of Forms.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(2). This rule and Rule 9(c)(1) modify the existing practice under which a warrant may be served only within the district in which it is issued. <em>Mitchell v. Dexter</em>, 244 F. 926 (C.C.A. 1st, 1917); <em>Palmer v. Thompson</em>, 20 App. D.C. 273 (1902); but see <em>In re Christian</em>, 82 F. 885 (C.C.W.D.Ark., 1897); 2 Op.Atty.Gen. 564. When a defendant is apprehended in a district other than that in which the prosecution has been instituted, this change will eliminate some of the steps that are at present followed: the issuance of a warrant in the district where the prosecution is pending; the return of the warrant <em>non est inventus</em>; the filing of a complaint on the basis of the warrant and its return in the district in which the defendant is found; and the issuance of another warrant in the latter district. The warrant originally issued will have efficacy throughout the United States and will constitute authority for arresting the defendant wherever found. Waite, 27 Jour. of Am. Judicature Soc. 101, 103. The change will not modify or affect the rights of the defendant as to removal. See Rule 40. The authority of the marshal to serve process is not limited to the district for which he is appointed, 28 U.S.C. 503 [now 569].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(3). 1. The provision that the arresting officer need not have the warrant in his possession at the time of the arrest is rendered necessary by the fact that a fugitive may be discovered and apprehended by any one of many officers. It is obviously impossible for a warrant to be in the possession of every officer who is searching for a fugitive or who unexpectedly might find himself in a position to apprehend the fugitive. The rule sets forth the customary practice in such matters, which has the sanction of the courts. &ldquo;It would be a strong proposition in an ordinary felony case to say that a fugitive from justice for whom a capias or warrant was outstanding could not be apprehended until the apprehending officer had physical possession of the capias or the warrant. If such were the law, criminals could circulate freely from one end of the land to the other, because they could always keep ahead of an officer with the warrant.&rdquo; <em>In re Kosopud</em> (N.D. Ohio), 272 F. 330, 336. Waite, 27 Jour. of Am. Judicature Soc. 101, 103. The rule, however, safeguards the defendant's rights in such case.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Service of summons under the rule is substantially the same as in civil actions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4(d)(1) [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(4). Return of a warrant or summons to the commissioner or other officer is provided by 18 U.S.C. 603 [now 4084] (Writs; copy as jailer's authority). The return of all &ldquo;copies of process&rdquo; by the commissioner to the clerk of the court is provided by 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041]; and see Rule 5(c), <em>infra.</em></p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480 (1958) it was held that to support the issuance of a warrant the complaint must contain in addition to a statement &ldquo;of the essential facts constituting the offense&rdquo; (Rule 3) a statement of the facts relied upon by the complainant to establish probable cause. The amendment permits the complainant to state the facts constituting prob<!-- PDFPage:18 -->able cause in a separate affidavit in lieu of spelling them out in the complaint. See also <em>Jaben v. United States</em>, 381 U.S. 214 (1965).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Throughout the rule the term &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;commissioner.&rdquo; Magistrate is defined in rule 54 to include a judge of the United States, a United States magistrate, and those state and local judicial officers specified in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are designed to achieve several objectives: (1) to make explicit the fact that the determination of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence; (2) to make clear that probable cause is a prerequisite to the issuance of a summons; and (3) to give priority to the issuance of a summons rather than a warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) makes clear that the normal situation is to issue a summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) provides for the issuance of an arrest warrant in lieu of or in addition to the issuance of a summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1) restates the provision of the old rule mandating the issuance of a warrant when a defendant fails to appear in response to a summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) provides for the issuance of an arrest warrant rather than a summons whenever &ldquo;a valid reason is shown&rdquo; for the issuance of a warrant. The reason may be apparent from the face of the complaint or may be provided by the federal law enforcement officer or attorney for the government. See comparable provision in rule 9.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) deals with the situation in which conditions change after a summons has issued. It affords the government an opportunity to demonstrate the need for an arrest warrant. This may be done in the district in which the defendant is located if this is the convenient place to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that a warrant or summons may issue on the basis of hearsay evidence. What constitutes probable cause is left to be dealt with on a case-to-case basis, taking account of the unlimited variations in source of information and in the opportunity of the informant to perceive accurately the factual data which he furnishes. See <em>e.g., Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480, 78 S.Ct. 1245, 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1958); <em>Aguilar v. Texas</em>, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964); <em>United States v. Ventresca</em>, 380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965); <em>Jaben v. United States</em>, 381 U.S. 214, 85 S.Ct. 1365, 14 L.Ed.2d 345 (1965); <em>McCray v. Illinois</em>, 386 U.S. 300, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967); <em>Spinelli v. United States</em>, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969); <em>United States v. Harris</em>, 403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); Note, The Informer's Tip as Probable Cause for Search or Arrest, 54 Cornell L.Rev. 958 (1969); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;52 (1969, Supp. 1971); 8 S.J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;4.03 (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with arrest procedures when a criminal complaint has been filed. It provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">If it appears&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that there is probable cause&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue to any officer authorized by law to execute it. Upon the <em>request</em> of the attorney for the government a summons instead of a warrant <em>shall</em> issue. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court's amendments make a basic change in Rule 4. As proposed to be amended, Rule 4 gives priority to the issuance of a summons instead of an arrest warrant. In order for the magistrate to issue an arrest warrant, the attorney for the government must show a &ldquo;valid reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee agrees with and approves the basic change in Rule 4. The decision to take a citizen into custody is a very important one with far-reaching consequences. That decision ought to be made by a neutral official (a magistrate) rather than by an interested party (the prosecutor).</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been argued that undesirable consequences will result if this change is adopted&mdash;including an increase in the number of fugitives and the introduction of substantial delays in our system of criminal justice. [See testimony of Assistant Attorney General W. Vincent Rakestraw in Hearings on Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., Serial No. 61, at 41&ndash;43 (1974) [hereinafter cited as &ldquo;Hearing I&rdquo;].] The Committee has carefully considered these arguments and finds them to be wanting. [The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules has thoroughly analyzed the arguments raised by Mr. Rakestraw and convincingly demonstrated that the undesirable consequences predicted will not necessarily result. See Hearings on Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules on Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Congress, 1st Session, Serial No. 6, at 208&ndash;09 (1975) [hereinafter cited &ldquo;Hearings II&rdquo;].] The present rule permits the use of a summons in lieu of a warrant. The major difference between the present rule and the proposed rule is that the present rule vests the decision to issue a summons or a warrant in the prosecutor, while the proposed rule vests that decision in a judicial officer. Thus, the basic premise underlying the arguments against the proposed rule is the notion that only the prosecutor can be trusted to act responsibly in deciding whether a summons or a warrant shall issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee rejects the notion that the federal judiciary cannot be trusted to exercise discretion wisely and in the public interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee recast the language of Rule 4(b). No change in substance is intended. The phrase &ldquo;valid reason&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;good cause,&rdquo; a phrase with which lawyers are more familiar. [Rule 4, both as proposed by the Supreme Court and as changed by the Committee, does not in any way authorize a magistrate to issue a summons or a warrant sua sponte, nor does it enlarge, limit or change in any way the law governing warrantless arrests.]</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee deleted two sentences from Rule 4(c). These sentences permitted a magistrate to question the complainant and other witnesses under oath and required the magistrate to keep a record or summary of such a proceeding. The Committee does not intend this change to discontinue or discourage the practice of having the complainant appear personally or the practice of making a record or summary of such an appearance. Rather, the Committee intended to leave Rule 4(c) neutral on this matter, neither encouraging nor discouraging these practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added a new section that provides that the determination of good cause for the issuance of a warrant in lieu of a summons shall not be grounds for a motion to suppress evidence. This provision does not apply when the issue is whether there was probable cause to believe an offense has been committed. This provision does not in any way expand or limit the so-called &ldquo;exclusionary rule.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 94&ndash;414; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(e)(3) deals with the manner in which warrants and summonses may be served. The House version provides two methods for serving a summons: (1) personal service upon the defendant, or (2) service by leaving it with someone of suitable age at the defendant's dwelling <em>and</em> by mailing it to the defendant's last known address. The Senate version provides three methods: (1) <!-- PDFPage:19 -->personal service, (2) service by leaving it with someone of suitable age at the defendant's dwelling, or (3) service by mailing it to defendant's last known address.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 4 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first non-stylistic change is in Rule 4(a), which has been amended to provide an element of discretion in those situations when the defendant fails to respond to a summons. Under the current rule, the judge must in all cases issue an arrest warrant. The revised rule provides discretion to the judge to issue an arrest warrant if the attorney for the government does not request that an arrest warrant be issued for a failure to appear.</p>
<p class="note-body">Current Rule 4(b), which refers to the fact that hearsay evidence may be used to support probable cause, has been deleted. That language was added to the rule in 1974, apparently to reflect emerging federal case law. <em>See</em> Advisory Committee Note to 1974 Amendments to Rule 4 (citing cases). A similar amendment was made to Rule 41 in 1972. In the intervening years, however, the case law has become perfectly clear on that proposition. Thus, the Committee believed that the reference to hearsay was no longer necessary. Furthermore, the limited reference to hearsay evidence was misleading to the extent that it might have suggested that other forms of inadmissible evidence could not be considered. For example, the rule made no reference to considering a defendant's prior criminal record, which clearly may be considered in deciding whether probable cause exists. <em>See, e.g., Brinegar v. United States</em>, 338 U.S. 160 (1949) (officer's knowledge of defendant's prior criminal activity). Rather than address that issue, or any other similar issues, the Committee believed that the matter was best addressed in Rule 1101(d)(3), Federal Rules of Evidence. That rule explicitly provides that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to &ldquo;preliminary examinations in criminal cases, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. issuance of warrants for arrest, criminal summonses, and search warrants.&rdquo; The Advisory Committee Note accompanying that rule recognizes that: &ldquo;The nature of the proceedings makes application of the formal rules of evidence inappropriate and impracticable.&rdquo; The Committee did not intend to make any substantive changes in practice by deleting the reference to hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">New Rule 4(b), which is currently Rule 4(c), addresses the form of an arrest warrant and a summons and includes two non-stylistic changes. First, Rule 4(b)(1)(C) mandates that the warrant require that the defendant be brought &ldquo;without unnecessary delay&rdquo; before a judge. The Committee believed that this was a more appropriate standard than the current requirement that the defendant be brought before the &ldquo;nearest available&rdquo; magistrate judge. This new language accurately reflects the thrust of the original rule, that time is of the essence and that the defendant should be brought with dispatch before a judicial officer in the district. Second, the revised rule states a preference that the defendant be brought before a federal judicial officer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(b)(2) has been amended to require that if a summons is issued, the defendant must appear before a magistrate judge. The current rule requires the appearance before a &ldquo;magistrate,&rdquo; which could include a state or local judicial officer. This change is consistent with the preference for requiring defendants to appear before federal judicial officers stated in revised Rule 4(b)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(c) (currently Rule 4(d)) includes three changes. First, current Rule 4(d)(2) states the traditional rule recognizing the territorial limits for executing warrants. Rule 4(c)(2) includes new language that reflects the recent enactment of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (Pub. L. No. 106&ndash;523, 114 Stat. 2488) that permits arrests of certain military and Department of Defense personnel overseas. <em>See also</em> 14 U.S.C. &sect;89 (Coast Guard authority to effect arrests outside territorial limits of United States). Second, current Rule 4(d)(3) provides that the arresting officer is only required to inform the defendant of the offense charged and that a warrant exists if the officer does not have a copy of the warrant. As revised, Rule 4(c)(3)(A) explicitly requires the arresting officer in all instances to inform the defendant of the offense charged and of the fact that an arrest warrant exists. The new rule continues the current provision that the arresting officer need not have a copy of the warrant, but if the defendant requests to see it, the officer must show the warrant to the defendant as soon as possible. The rule does not attempt to define any particular time limits for showing the warrant to the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, Rule 4(c)(3)(C) is taken from former Rule 9(c)(1). That provision specifies the manner of serving a summons on an organization. The Committee believed that Rule 4 was the more appropriate location for general provisions addressing the mechanics of arrest warrants and summonses. Revised Rule 9 liberally cross-references the basic provisions appearing in Rule 4. Under the amended rule, in all cases in which a summons is being served on an organization, a copy of the summons must be mailed to the organization.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth, a change is made in Rule 4(c)(4). Currently, Rule 4(d)(4) requires that an unexecuted warrant must be returned to the judicial officer or judge who issued it. As amended, Rule 4(c)(4)(A) provides that after a warrant is executed, the officer must return it to the judge before whom the defendant will appear under Rule 5. At the government's request, however, an unexecuted warrant must be canceled by a magistrate judge. The change recognizes the possibility that at the time the warrant is returned, the issuing judicial officer may not be available.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The time within which a prisoner must be brought before a committing magistrate is defined differently in different statutes. The rule supersedes all statutory provisions on this point and fixes a single standard, i.e., &ldquo;without unnecessary delay&rdquo;, 18 U.S.C. [former] 593 (Operating illicit distillery; arrest; bail); sec. [former] 595 (Persons arrested taken before nearest officer for hearing); 5 U.S.C. 300a [now 18 U.S.C. 3052, 3107] (Division of Investigation; authority of officers to serve warrants and make arrests); <!-- PDFPage:21 -->16 U.S.C. 10 (Arrests by employees of park service for violations of laws and regulations); sec. 706 (Migratory Bird Treaty Act; arrests; search warrants); D.C. Code (1940), Title 4, sec. 140 (Arrests without warrant); see, also, 33 U.S.C. 436, 446, 452; 46 U.S.C. 708 [now 18 U.S.C. 2279]. What constitutes &ldquo;unnecessary delay&rdquo;, i.e., reasonable time within which the prisoner should be brought before a committing magistrate, must be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances of the case. The following authorities discuss the question what constitutes reasonable time for this purpose in various situations: <em>Carroll v. Parry</em>, 48 App.D.C. 453; <em>Janus v. United States</em>, 38 F.2d 431 (C.C.A. 9th); <em>Commonwealth v. Di Stasio</em>, 294 Mass. 273; <em>State v. Freeman</em>, 86 N.C. 683; <em>Peloquin v. Hibner</em>, 231 Wis. 77; see, also, Warner, 28 Va.L.R. 315, 339&ndash;341.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule also states the prevailing state practice, A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), Commentaries to secs. 35, 36.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions</em> (b) and (c). 1. These rules prescribe a uniform procedure to be followed at preliminary hearings before a commissioner. They supersede the general provisions of 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial). The procedure prescribed by the rules is that generally prevailing. See <em>Wood v. United States</em>, 128 F.2d 265, 271&ndash;272 (App. D.C.); A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), secs. 39&ndash;60 and Commentaries thereto; <em>Manual for United States Commissioners</em>, pp. 6&ndash;10, published by Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Pleas before a commissioner are excluded, as a plea of guilty at this stage has no legal status or function except to serve as a waiver of preliminary examination. It has been held inadmissible in evidence at the trial, if the defendant was not represented by counsel when the plea was entered. <em>Wood v. United States</em>, 128 F.2d 265 (App. D.C.) The rule expressly provides for a waiver of examination, thereby eliminating any necessity for a provision as to plea.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first change is designed to insure that under the revision made in Rule 4(a) the defendant arrested on a warrant will receive the same information concerning the basis for the issuance of the warrant as would previously have been given him by the complaint itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second change obligates the commissioner to inform the defendant of his right to request the assignment of counsel if he is unable to obtain counsel. Cf. the amendment to Rule 44, and the Advisory Committee's Note thereon.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">There are a number of changes made in rule 5 which are designed to improve the editorial clarity of the rule; to conform the rule to the Federal Magistrates Act; and to deal explicitly in the rule with issues as to which the rule was silent and the law uncertain.</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal editorial change is to deal separately with the initial appearance before the magistrate and the preliminary examination. They are dealt with together in old rule 5. They are separated in order to prevent confusion as to whether they constitute a single or two separate proceedings. Although the preliminary examination can be held at the time of the initial appearance, in practice this ordinarily does not occur. Usually counsel need time to prepare for the preliminary examination and as a consequence a separate date is typically set for the preliminary examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because federal magistrates are reasonably available to conduct initial appearances, the rule is drafted on the assumption that the initial appearance is before a federal magistrate. If experience under the act indicates that there must be frequent appearances before state or local judicial officers it may be desirable to draft an additional rule, such as the following, detailing the procedure for an initial appearance before a state or local judicial officer:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Initial Appearance Before a State or Local Judicial Officer</em>. If a United States magistrate is not reasonably available under rule 5(a), the arrested person shall be brought before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041, and such officer shall inform the person of the rights specified in rule 5(c) and shall authorize the release of the arrested person under the terms provided for by these rules and by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146. The judicial officer shall immediately transmit any written order of release and any papers filed before him to the appropriate United States magistrate of the district and order the arrested person to appear before such United States magistrate within three days if not in custody or at the next regular hour of business of the United States magistrate if the arrested person is retained in custody. Upon his appearance before the United States magistrate, the procedure shall be that prescribed in rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several changes are made to conform the language of the rule to the Federal Magistrates Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The term &ldquo;magistrate,&rdquo; which is defined in new rule 54, is substituted for the term &ldquo;commissioner.&rdquo; As defined, &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; includes those state and local judicial officers specified in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041, and thus the initial appearance may be before a state or local judicial officer when a federal magistrate is not reasonably available. This is made explicit in subdivision (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Subdivision (b) conforms the rule to the procedure prescribed in the Federal Magistrate Act when a defendant appears before a magistrate charged with a &ldquo;minor offense&rdquo; as defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(f):</p>
<p class="note-body-block">&ldquo;misdemeanors punishable under the laws of the United States, the penalty for which does not exceed imprisonment for a period of one year, or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both, except that such term does not include .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [specified exceptions].&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">If the &ldquo;minor offense&rdquo; is tried before a United States magistrate, the procedure must be in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before United States Magistrates, (January 27, 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Subdivision (d) makes clear that a defendant is not entitled to a preliminary examination if he has been indicted by a grand jury prior to the date set for the preliminary examination or, in appropriate cases, if any information is filed in the district court prior to that date. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80, pp. 137&ndash;140 (1969, Supp. 1971). This is also provided in the Federal Magistrates Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5 is also amended to deal with several issues not dealt with in old rule 5:</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to make clear that a complaint, complying with the requirements of rule 4(a), must be filed whenever a person has been arrested without a warrant. This means that the complaint, or an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint, must show probable cause. As provided in rule 4(a) the showing of probable cause &ldquo;may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that defendant should be notified of the general circumstances under which he is entitled to pretrial release under the Bail Reform Act of 1966 (18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3141&ndash;3152). Defendants often do not in fact have counsel at the initial appearance and thus, unless told by the magistrate, may be unaware of their right to pretrial release. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;78 N. 61 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) makes clear that a defendant who does not waive his right to trial before a judge of the district court is entitled to a preliminary examination to determine probable cause for any offense except a petty offense. It also, by necessary implication, makes clear that a defendant is not entitled to a preliminary examination if he consents to be tried on the issue of guilt or innocence by the United States magistrate, even though the offense may be one not heretofore triable by the United States commissioner and therefore one as to which the defendant had a right to a preliminary examination. The rationale is that the prelimi<!-- PDFPage:22 -->nary examination serves only to justify holding the defendant in custody or on bail during the period of time it takes to bind the defendant over to the district court for trial. See <em>State v. Solomon</em>, 158 Wis. 146, 147 N.W. 640 (1914). A similar conclusion is reached in the New York Proposed Criminal Procedure Law. See McKinney's Session Law News, April 10, 1969, at p. A&ndash;119.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) also contains time limits within which the preliminary examination must be held. These are taken from 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060. The provisions for the extension of the prescribed time limits are the same as the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060 with two exceptions: The new language allows delay consented to by the defendant only if there is &ldquo;a showing of good cause, taking into account the public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases.&rdquo; This reflects the view of the Advisory Committee that delay, whether prosecution or defense induced, ought to be avoided whenever possible. The second difference between the new rule and 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060 is that the rule allows the decision to grant a continuance to be made by a United States magistrate as well as by a judge of the United States. This reflects the view of the Advisory Committee that the United States magistrate should have sufficient judicial competence to make decisions such as that contemplated in subdivision (c).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of subdivision (b) reflects the recent amendment of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(a), by the Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, to read: &ldquo;When specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or courts he serves, any United States magistrate shall have jurisdiction to try persons accused of, and sentence persons convicted of, misdemeanors committed within that judicial district.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1990 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b) is amended to conform the rule to Rule 58.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 5 is intended to address the interplay between the requirements for a prompt appearance before a magistrate judge and the processing of persons arrested for the offense of unlawfully fleeing to avoid prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073, when no federal prosecution is intended. Title 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073 provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Whoever moves or travels in interstate or foreign commerce with intent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, under the laws of the place from which he flees .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Violations of this section may be prosecuted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only upon formal approval in writing by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General of the United States, which function of approving prosecutions may not be delegated.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">In enacting &sect;1073, Congress apparently intended to provide assistance to state criminal justice authorities in an effort to apprehend and prosecute state offenders. It also appears that by requiring permission of high ranking officials, Congress intended that prosecutions be limited in number. In fact, prosecutions under this section have been rare. The purpose of the statute is fulfilled when the person is apprehended and turned over to state or local authorities. In such cases the requirement of Rule 5 that any person arrested under a federal warrant must be brought before a federal magistrate judge becomes a largely meaningless exercise and a needless demand upon federal judicial resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addressing this problem, several options are available to federal authorities when no federal prosecution is intended to ensue after the arrest. First, once federal authorities locate a fugitive, they may contact local law enforcement officials who make the arrest based upon the underlying out-of-state warrant. In that instance, Rule 5 is not implicated and the United States Attorney in the district issuing the &sect;1073 complaint and warrant can take action to dismiss both. In a second scenario, the fugitive is arrested by federal authorities who, in compliance with Rule 5, bring the person before a federal magistrate judge. If local law enforcement officers are present, they can take custody, once the United States Attorney informs the magistrate judge that there will be no prosecution under &sect;1073. Depending on the availability of state or local officers, there may be some delay in the Rule 5 proceedings; any delays following release to local officials, however, would not be a function of Rule 5. In a third situation, federal authorities arrest the fugitive but local law enforcement authorities are not present at the Rule 5 appearance. Depending on a variety of practices, the magistrate judge may calendar a removal hearing under Rule 40, or order that the person be held in federal custody pending further action by the local authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment, officers arresting a fugitive charged only with violating &sect;1073 need not bring the person before a magistrate judge under Rule 5(a) if there is no intent to actually prosecute the person under that charge. Two requirements, however, must be met. First, the arrested fugitive must be transferred without unnecessary delay to the custody of state officials. Second, steps must be taken in the appropriate district to dismiss the complaint alleging a violation of &sect;1073. The rule continues to contemplate that persons arrested by federal officials are entitled to prompt handling of federal charges, if prosecution is intended, and prompt transfer to state custody if federal prosecution is not contemplated.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5 has been completely revised to more clearly set out the procedures for initial appearances and to recognize that such appearances may be required at various stages of a criminal proceeding, for example, where a defendant has been arrested for violating the terms of probation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(a), which governs initial appearances by an arrested defendant before a magistrate judge, includes several changes. The first is a clarifying change; revised Rule 5(a)(1) provides that a person making the arrest must bring the defendant &ldquo;without unnecessary delay&rdquo; before a magistrate judge, instead of the current reference to &ldquo;nearest available&rdquo; magistrate judge. This language parallels changes in Rule 4 and reflects the view that time is of the essence. The Committee intends no change in practice. In using the term, the Committee recognizes that on occasion there may be necessary delay in presenting the defendant, for example, due to weather conditions or other natural causes. A second change is non-stylistic, and reflects the stated preference (as in other provisions throughout the rules) <!-- PDFPage:23 -->that the defendant be brought before a federal judicial officer. Only if a magistrate judge is not available should the defendant be taken before a state or local officer.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third sentence in current Rule 5(a), which states that a magistrate judge must proceed in accordance with the rule where a defendant is arrested without a warrant or given a summons, has been deleted because it is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(a)(1)(B) codifies the caselaw reflecting that the right to an initial appearance applies not only when a person is arrested within the United States but also when an arrest occurs outside the United States. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Purvis</em>, 768 F.2d 1237 (11th Cir. 1985); <em>United States v. Yunis</em>, 859 F.2d 953 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In these circumstances, the Committee believes&mdash;and the rule so provides&mdash;that the initial appearance should be before a federal magistrate judge rather than a state or local judicial officer. Rule 5(a)(1)(B) has also been amended by adding the words, &ldquo;unless a federal statute provides otherwise,&rdquo; to reflect recent enactment of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (Pub. L. No. 106&ndash;523, 114 Stat. 2488) that permits certain persons overseas to appear before a magistrate judge by telephonic communication.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(a)(2)(A) consists of language currently located in Rule 5 that addresses the procedure to be followed where a defendant has been arrested under a warrant issued on a complaint charging solely a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073 (unlawful flight to avoid prosecution). Rule 5(a)(2)(B) and 5(a)(2)(C) are new provisions. They are intended to make it clear that when a defendant is arrested for violating probation or supervised release, or for failing to appear in another district, Rules 32.1 or 40 apply. No change in practice is intended.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(a)(3) is new and fills a perceived gap in the rules. It recognizes that a defendant may be subjected to an initial appearance under this rule if a summons was issued under Rule 4, instead of an arrest warrant. If the defendant is appearing pursuant to a summons in a felony case, Rule 5(d) applies, and if the defendant is appearing in a misdemeanor case, Rule 5(e) applies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b) carries forward the requirement in former Rule 5(a) that if the defendant is arrested without a warrant, a complaint must be promptly filed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(c) is a new provision and sets out where an initial appearance is to take place. If the defendant is arrested in the district where the offense was allegedly committed, under Rule 5(c)(1) the defendant must be taken to a magistrate judge in that district. If no magistrate judge is reasonably available, a state or local judicial officer may conduct the initial appearance. On the other hand, if the defendant is arrested in a district other than the district where the offense was allegedly committed, Rule 5(c)(2) governs. In those instances, the defendant must be taken to a magistrate judge within the district of arrest, unless the appearance can take place more promptly in an adjacent district. The Committee recognized that in some cases, the nearest magistrate judge may actually be across a district's lines. The remainder of Rule 5(c)(2) includes material formerly located in Rule 40.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(d), derived from current Rule 5(c), has been retitled to more clearly reflect the subject of that subdivision and the procedure to be used if the defendant is charged with a felony. Rule 5(d)(4) has been added to make clear that a defendant may only be called upon to enter a plea under the provisions of Rule 10. That language is intended to reflect and reaffirm current practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The remaining portions of current Rule 5(c) have been moved to Rule 5.1, which deals with preliminary hearings in felony cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">The major substantive change is in new Rule 5(f), which permits video teleconferencing for an appearance under this rule if the defendant consents. This change reflects the growing practice among state courts to use video teleconferencing to conduct initial proceedings. A similar amendment has been made to Rule 10 concerning arraignments.</p>
<p class="note-body">In amending Rules 5, 10, and 43 (which generally requires the defendant's presence at all proceedings), the Committee carefully considered the argument that permitting a defendant to appear by video teleconferencing might be considered an erosion of an important element of the judicial process. Much can be lost when video teleconferencing occurs. First, the setting itself may not promote the public's confidence in the integrity and solemnity of a federal criminal proceeding; that is the view of some who have witnessed the use of such proceedings in some state jurisdictions. While it is difficult to quantify the intangible benefits and impact of requiring a defendant to be brought before a federal judicial officer in a federal courtroom, the Committee realizes that something is lost when a defendant is not required to make a personal appearance. A related consideration is that the defendant may be located in a room that bears no resemblance whatsoever to a judicial forum and the equipment may be inadequate for high-quality transmissions. Second, using video teleconferencing can interfere with counsel's ability to meet personally with his or her client at what, at least in that jurisdiction, might be an important appearance before a magistrate judge. Third, the defendant may miss an opportunity to meet with family or friends, and others who might be able to assist the defendant, especially in any attempts to obtain bail. Finally, the magistrate judge may miss an opportunity to accurately assess the physical, emotional, and mental condition of a defendant&mdash;a factor that may weigh on pretrial decisions, such as release from detention.</p>
<p class="note-body">On the other hand, the Committee considered that in some jurisdictions, the court systems face a high volume of criminal proceedings. In other jurisdictions, counsel may not be appointed until after the initial appearance and thus there is no real problem with a defendant being able to consult with counsel before or during that proceeding. The Committee was also persuaded to adopt the amendment because in some jurisdictions delays may occur in travel time from one location to another&mdash;in some cases requiring either the magistrate judge or the participants to travel long distances. In those instances, it is not unusual for a defense counsel to recognize the benefit of conducting a video teleconferenced proceeding, which will eliminate lengthy and sometimes expensive travel or permit the initial appearance to be conducted much sooner. Finally, the Committee was aware that in some jurisdictions, courtrooms now contain high quality technology for conducting such procedures, and that some courts are already using video teleconferencing&mdash;with the consent of the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee believed that, on balance and in appropriate circumstances, the court and the defendant should have the option of using video teleconferencing, as long as the defendant consents to that procedure. The question of when it would be appropriate for a defendant to consent is not spelled out in the rule. That is left to the defendant and the court in each case. Although the rule does not specify any particular technical requirements regarding the system to be used, if the equipment or technology is deficient, the public may lose confidence in the integrity and dignity of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment does not require a court to adopt or use video teleconferencing. In deciding whether to use such procedures, a court may wish to consider establishing clearly articulated standards and procedures. For example, the court would normally want to insure that the location used for televising the video teleconferencing is conducive to the solemnity of a federal criminal proceeding. That might require additional coordination, for example, with the detention facility to insure that the room, furniture, and furnishings reflect the dignity associated with a federal courtroom. Provision should also be made to insure that the judge, or a surrogate, is in a position to carefully assess the defendant's condition. And the court should also consider establishing procedures for insuring that counsel and the defendant (and even the defendant's immediate <!-- PDFPage:24 -->family) are provided an ample opportunity to confer in private.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 5.1. Preliminary Hearing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) In General.</strong> If a defendant is charged with an offense other than a petty offense, a magistrate judge must conduct a preliminary hearing unless:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the defendant waives the hearing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the defendant is indicted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the government files an information under Rule 7(b) charging the defendant with a felony;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the government files an information charging the defendant with a misdemeanor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor and consents to trial before a magistrate judge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Selecting a District.</strong> A defendant arrested in a district other than where the offense was allegedly committed may elect to have the preliminary hearing conducted in the district where the prosecution is pending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Scheduling.</strong> The magistrate judge must hold the preliminary hearing within a reasonable time, but no later than 10 days after the initial appearance if the defendant is in custody and no later than 20 days if not in custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Extending the Time.</strong> With the defendant's consent and upon a showing of good cause&mdash;taking into account the public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases&mdash;a magistrate judge may extend the time limits in Rule 5.1(c) one or more times. If the defendant does not consent, the magistrate judge may extend the time limits only on a showing that extraordinary circumstances exist and justice requires the delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Hearing and Finding.</strong> At the preliminary hearing, the defendant may cross-examine adverse witnesses and may introduce evidence but may not object to evidence on the ground that it was unlawfully acquired. If the magistrate judge finds probable cause to believe an offense has been committed and the defendant committed it, the magistrate judge must promptly require the defendant to appear for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Discharging the Defendant.</strong> If the magistrate judge finds no probable cause to believe an offense has been committed or the defendant committed it, the magistrate judge must dismiss the complaint and discharge the defendant. A discharge does not preclude the government from later prosecuting the defendant for the same offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Recording the Proceedings.</strong> The preliminary hearing must be recorded by a court reporter or by a suitable recording device. A recording of the proceeding may be made available to any party upon request. A copy of the recording and a transcript may be provided to any party upon request and upon any payment required by applicable Judicial Conference regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Producing a Statement.</strong></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(1) <em>In General.</em></strong> Rule 26.2(a)&ndash;(d) and (f) applies at any hearing under this rule, unless the magistrate judge for good cause rules otherwise in a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><strong>(2) <em>Sanctions for Not Producing a Statement.</em></strong> If a party disobeys a Rule 26.2 order to deliver a statement to the moving party, the magistrate judge must not consider the testimony of a witness whose statement is withheld.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1 is, for the most part, a clarification of old rule 5(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the new rule, the preliminary examination must be conducted before a &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; as defined in rule 54. Giving state or local judicial officers authority to conduct a preliminary examination does not seem necessary. There are not likely to be situations in which a &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; is not &ldquo;reasonably available&rdquo; to conduct the preliminary examination, which is usually not held until several days after the initial appearance provided for in rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) makes clear that a finding of probable cause may be based on &ldquo;hearsay evidence in whole or in part.&rdquo; The propriety of relying upon hearsay at the preliminary examination has been a matter of some uncertainty in the federal system. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 (1969, Supp. 1971); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;504[4] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971); <em>Washington v. Clemmer</em>, 339 F.2d 715, 719 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Washington v. Clemmer</em>, 339 F.2d 725, 728 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Ross v. Sirica</em>, 380 F.2d 557, 565 (D.C. Cir. 1967); <em>Howard v. United States</em>, 389 F.2d 287, 292 (D.C. Cir. 1967); Weinberg and Weinberg, The Congressional Invitation to Avoid the Preliminary Hearing: An Analysis of Section 303 of the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, 67 Mich.L.Rev. 1361, especially n. 92 at 1383 (1969); D. Wright, The Rules of Evidence Applicable to Hearings in Probable Cause, 37 Conn.B.J. 561 (1963); Comment, Preliminary Examination&mdash;Evidence and Due Process, 15 Kan.L.Rev. 374, 379&ndash;381 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">A grand jury indictment may properly be based upon hearsay evidence. <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359 (1956); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;6.03[2] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971). This being so, there is practical advantage in making the evidentiary requirements for the preliminary examination as flexible as they are for the grand jury. Otherwise there will be increased pressure upon United States Attorneys to abandon the preliminary examination in favor of the grand jury indictment. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 at p. 143 (1969). New York State, which also utilizes both the preliminary examination and the grand jury, has under consideration a new Code of Criminal Procedure which would allow the use of hearsay at the preliminary examination. See McKinney's Session Law News, April 10, 1969, pp. A119&ndash;A120.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the same reason, subdivision (a) also provides that the preliminary examination is not the proper place to raise the issue of illegally obtained evidence. This is current law. In <em>Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480, 484 (1958), the Supreme Court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-block">[T]he Commissioner here had no authority to adjudicate the admissibility at petitioner's later trial of the heroin taken from his person. That issue was for the trial court. This is specifically recognized by Rule 41(e) of the Criminal Rules, which provides that a defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may &ldquo;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* move the district court *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to suppress for use as evidence anything so obtained on the ground that *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; the arrest warrant was defective on any of several grounds.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:25 --><p class="note-body">Dicta in <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359, 363&ndash;364 (1956), and <em>United States v. Blue</em>, 384 U.S. 251, 255 (1966), also support the proposed rule. In <em>United States ex rel. Almeida v. Rundle</em>, 383 F.2d 421, 424 (3d Cir. 1967), the court, in considering the adequacy of an indictment said:</p>
<p class="note-body">On this score, it is settled law that (1) &ldquo;[an] indictment returned by a legally constituted nonbiased grand jury, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is enough to call for a trial of the charge on the merits and satisfies the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.&rdquo;, <em>Lawn v. United States</em>, 355 U.S. 399, 349, 78 S.Ct. 311, 317, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958); (2) an indictment cannot be challenged &ldquo;on the ground that there was inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury&rdquo;, <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 408, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956); and (3) a prosecution is not abated, nor barred, even where &ldquo;tainted evidence&rdquo; has been submitted to a grand jury, <em>United States v. Blue</em>, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 at 143 n. 5 (1969, Supp. 1971) 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;6.03[3] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971). The Manual for United States Commissioners (Administrative Office of United States Courts, 1948) provides at pp. 24&ndash;25: &ldquo;Motions for this purpose [to suppress illegally obtained evidence] may be made and heard only before a district judge. Commissioners are not empowered to consider or act upon such motions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been urged that the rules of evidence at the preliminary examination should be those applicable at the trial because the purpose of the preliminary examination should be, not to review the propriety of the arrest or prior detention, but rather to determine whether there is evidence sufficient to justify subjecting the defendant to the expense and inconvenience of trial. See Weinberg and Weinberg, The Congressional Invitation to Avoid the Preliminary Hearing: An Analysis of Section 303 of the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, 67 Mich. L. Rev. 1361, 1396&ndash;1399 (1969). The rule rejects this view for reasons largely of administrative necessity and the efficient administration of justice. The Congress has decided that a preliminary examination shall not be required when there is a grand jury indictment (18 U.S.C. &sect;3060). Increasing the procedural and evidentiary requirements applicable to the preliminary examination will therefore add to the administrative pressure to avoid the preliminary examination. Allowing objections to evidence on the ground that evidence has been illegally obtained would require two determinations of admissibility, one before the United States magistrate and one in the district court. The objective is to reduce, not increase, the number of preliminary motions.</p>
<p class="note-body">To provide that a probable cause finding may be based upon hearsay does not preclude the magistrate from requiring a showing that admissible evidence will be available at the time of trial. See Comment, Criminal Procedure&mdash;Grand Jury&mdash;Validity of Indictment Based Solely on Hearsay Questioned When Direct Testimony Is Readily Available, 43 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 578 (1968); <em>United States v. Umans</em>, 368 F.2d. 725 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted 389 U.S. 80 (1967); <em>United States v. Andrews</em>, 381 F.2d 377, 378 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>United States v. Messina</em>, 388 F.2d 393, 394 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1968); and <em>United States v. Beltram</em>. 388 F.2d 449 (2d Cir. 1968); and <em>United States v. Arcuri</em>, 282 F.Supp. 347 (E.D.N.Y. 1968). The fact that a defendant is not entitled to object to evidence alleged to have been illegally obtained does not deprive him of an opportunity for a pretrial determination of the admissibility of evidence. He can raise such an objection prior to trial in accordance with the provisions of rule 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) makes it clear that the United States magistrate may not only discharge the defendant but may also dismiss the complaint. Current federal law authorizes the magistrate to discharge the defendant but he must await authorization from the United States Attorney before he can close his records on the case by dismissing the complaint. Making dismissal of the complaint a separate procedure accomplishes no worthwhile objective, and the new rule makes it clear that the magistrate can both discharge the defendant and file the record with the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) also deals with the legal effect of a discharge of a defendant at a preliminary examination. This issue is not dealt with explicitly in the old rule. Existing federal case law is limited. What cases there are seem to support the right of the government to issue a new complaint and start over. See <em>e.q., Collins v. Loisel</em>, 262 U.S. 426 (1923); <em>Morse v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 80 (1925). State law is similar. See <em>People v. Dillon</em>, 197 N.Y. 254, 90 N.E. 820 (1910; <em>Tell v. Wolke</em>, 21 Wis.2d 613, 124 N.W.2d 655 (1963). In the <em>Tell</em> case the Wisconsin court stated the common rationale for allowing the prosecutor to issue a new complaint and start over:</p>
<p class="note-body">The state has no appeal from errors of law committed by a magistrate upon preliminary examination and the discharge on a preliminary would operate as an unchallengeable acquittal. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The only way an error of law committed on the preliminary examination prejudicial to the state may be challenged or corrected is by a preliminary examination on a second complaint. (21 Wis. 2d at 619&ndash;620.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is based upon old rule 5(c) and upon the Federal Magistrates Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060(f). It provides methods for making available to counsel the record of the preliminary examination. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;82 (1969, Supp. 1971). The new rule is designed to eliminate delay and expense occasioned by preparation of transcripts where listening to the tape recording would be sufficient. Ordinarily the recording should be made available pursuant to subdivision (c)(1). A written transcript may be provided under subdivision (c)(2) at the discretion of the court, a discretion which must be exercised in accordance with <em>Britt v. North Carolina</em>, 404 U.S. 226, 30 L.Ed.2d 400, 405 (1971):</p>
<p class="note-body">A defendant who claims the right to a free transcript does not, under our cases, bear the burden of proving inadequate such alternatives as may be suggested by the State or conjured up by a court in hindsight. In this case, however, petitioner has conceded that he had available an informal alternative which appears to be substantially equivalent to a transcript. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court below was in error in rejecting his claim.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The addition of subdivision (d) mirrors similar amendments made in 1993 which extended the scope of Rule 26.2 to Rules 32, 32.1, 46 and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. As indicated in the Committee Notes accompanying those amendments, the primary reason for extending the coverage of Rule 26.2 rested heavily upon the compelling need for accurate information affecting a witness&rsquo; credibility. That need, the Committee believes, extends to a preliminary examination under this rule where both the prosecution and the defense have high interests at stake.</p>
<p class="note-body">A witness&rsquo; statement must be produced only after the witness has personally testified.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 5.1 After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Committee made no changes to the published draft.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:26 --><h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 5.1 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the title of the rule has been changed. Although the underlying statute, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060, uses the phrase <em>preliminary examination</em>, the Committee believes that the phrase <em>preliminary hearing</em> is more accurate. What happens at this proceeding is more than just an examination; it includes an evidentiary hearing, argument, and a judicial ruling. Further, the phrase <em>preliminary hearing</em> predominates in actual usage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1(a) is composed of the first sentence of the second paragraph of current Rule 5(c). Rule 5.1(b) addresses the ability of a defendant to elect where a preliminary hearing will be held. That provision is taken from current Rule 40(a).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1(c) and (d) include material currently located in Rule 5(c): scheduling and extending the time limits for the hearing. The Committee is aware that in most districts, magistrate judges perform these functions. That point is also reflected in the definition of &ldquo;court&rdquo; in Rule 1(b), which in turn recognizes that magistrate judges may be authorized to act.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1(d) contains a significant change in practice. The revised rule includes language that expands the authority of a United States magistrate judge to grant a continuance for a preliminary hearing conducted under the rule. Currently, the rule authorizes a magistrate judge to grant a continuance only in those cases in which the defendant has consented to the continuance. If the defendant does not consent, then the government must present the matter to a district judge, usually on the same day. The proposed amendment conflicts with 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060, which tracks the original language of the rule and permits only district judges to grant continuances when the defendant objects. The Committee believes that this restriction is an anomaly and that it can lead to needless consumption of judicial and other resources. Magistrate judges are routinely required to make probable cause determinations and other difficult decisions regarding the defendant's liberty interests, reflecting that the magistrate judge's role has developed toward a higher level of responsibility for pre-indictment matters. The Committee believes that the change in the rule will provide greater judicial economy and that it is entirely appropriate to seek this change to the rule through the Rules Enabling Act procedures. <em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. &sect;2072(b). Under those procedures, approval by Congress of this rule change would supersede the parallel provisions in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1(e), addressing the issue of probable cause, contains the language currently located in Rule 5.1(a), with the exception of the sentence, &ldquo;The finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part.&rdquo; That language was included in the original promulgation of the rule in 1972. Similar language was added to Rule 4 in 1974. In the Committee Note on the 1974 amendment, the Advisory Committee explained that the language was included to make it clear that a finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay, noting that there had been some uncertainty in the federal system about the propriety of relying upon hearsay at the preliminary hearing. <em>See</em> Advisory Committee Note to Rule 5.1 (citing cases and commentary). Federal law is now clear on that proposition. Thus, the Committee believed that the reference to hearsay was no longer necessary. Further, the Committee believed that the matter was best addressed in Rule 1101(d)(3), Federal Rules of Evidence. That rule explicitly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to &ldquo;preliminary examinations in criminal cases, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. issuance of warrants for arrest, criminal summonses, and search warrants.&rdquo; The Advisory Committee Note accompanying that rule recognizes that: &ldquo;The nature of the proceedings makes application of the formal rules of evidence inappropriate and impracticable.&rdquo; The Committee did not intend to make any substantive changes in practice by deleting the reference to hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1(f), which deals with the discharge of a defendant, consists of former Rule 5.1(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1(g) is a revised version of the material in current Rule 5.1(c). Instead of including detailed information in the rule itself concerning records of preliminary hearings, the Committee opted simply to direct the reader to the applicable Judicial Conference regulations governing records. The Committee did not intend to make any substantive changes in the way in which those records are currently made available.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, although the rule speaks in terms of initial appearances being conducted before a magistrate judge, Rule 1(c) makes clear that a district judge may perform any function in these rules that a magistrate judge may perform.</p>
