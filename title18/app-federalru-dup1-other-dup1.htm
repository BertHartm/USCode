<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>. If it appears from the complaint, or from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint, that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue to any officer authorized by law to execute it. Upon the request of the attorney for the government a summons instead of a warrant shall issue. More than one warrant or summons may issue on the same complaint. If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, a warrant shall issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Probable Cause</cap-smallcap>. The finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Form.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Warrant</em>. The warrant shall be signed by the magistrate judge and shall contain the name of the defendant or, if the defendant's name is unknown, any name or description by which the defendant can be identified with reasonable certainty. It shall describe the offense charged in the complaint. It shall command that the defendant be arrested and brought before the nearest available magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Summons</em>. The summons shall be in the same form as the warrant except that it shall summon the defendant to appear before a magistrate&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_4_1_target" name="Rule_4_1">1</a></sup> at a stated time and place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Execution or Service; and Return.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>By Whom</em>. The warrant shall be executed by a marshal or by some other officer authorized by law. The summons may be served by any person authorized to serve a summons in a civil action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Territorial Limits</em>. The warrant may be executed or the summons may be served at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Manner</em>. The warrant shall be executed by the arrest of the defendant. The officer need not have the warrant at the time of the arrest but upon request shall show the warrant to the defendant as soon as possible. If the officer does not have the warrant at the time of the arrest, the officer shall then inform the defendant of the offense charged and of the fact that a warrant has been issued. The summons shall be served upon a defendant by delivering a copy to the defendant personally, or by leaving it at the defendant's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein and by mailing a copy of the summons to the defendant's last known address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Return</em>. The officer executing a warrant shall make return thereof to the magistrate judge or other officer before whom the defendant is brought pursuant to Rule 5. At the request of the attorney for the government any unexecuted warrant shall be returned to and canceled by the magistrate judge by whom it was issued. On or before the return day the person to whom a summons was delivered for service shall make return thereof to the magistrate judge before whom the summons is returnable. At the request of the attorney for the government made at any time while the complaint is pending, a warrant returned unexecuted and not canceled or summons&nbsp;<sup><a href="#Rule_4_2_target" name="Rule_4_2">2</a></sup> returned unserved or a duplicate thereof may be delivered by the magistrate judge to the marshal or other authorized person for execution or service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The rule states the existing law relating to warrants issued by commissioner or other magistrate. United States Constitution, Amendment IV; 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The provision for summons is new, although a summons has been customarily used against corporate defendants, 28 U.S.C. 377 [now 1651] (Power to issue writs); <em>United States v. John Kelso Co</em>., 86 F. 304 (N.D.Cal., 1898). See also, <em>Albrecht v. United States</em>, 273 U.S. 1, 8 (1927). The use of the summons in criminal cases is sanctioned by many States, among them Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and others. See A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), Commentaries to secs. 12, 13, and 14. The use of the summons is permitted in England by 11 & 12 Vict., c. 42, sec. 1 (1848). More general use of a summons in place of a warrant was recommended by the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, <em>Report on Criminal Procedure</em> (1931) 47. The Uniform Arrest Act, proposed by the Interstate Commission on Crime, provides for a summons. Warner, 28 Va.L.R. 315. See also, Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild, R. 1, 6.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The provision for the issuance of additional warrants on the same complaint embodies the practice heretofore followed in some districts. It is desirable from a practical standpoint, since when a complaint names several defendants, it may be preferable to issue a separate warrant as to each in order to facilitate service and return, especially if the defendants are apprehended at different times and places. Berge, 42 Mich.L.R. 353, 356.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. Failure to respond to a summons is not a contempt of court, but is ground for issuing a warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). Compare Rule 9(b) and forms of warrant and summons, Appendix of Forms.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(2). This rule and Rule 9(c)(1) modify the existing practice under which a warrant may be served only within the district in which it is issued. <em>Mitchell v. Dexter</em>, 244 F. 926 (C.C.A. 1st, 1917); <em>Palmer v. Thompson</em>, 20 App. D.C. 273 (1902); but see <em>In re Christian</em>, 82 F. 885 (C.C.W.D.Ark., 1897); 2 Op.Atty.Gen. 564. When a defendant is apprehended in a district other than that in which the prosecution has been instituted, this change will eliminate some of the steps that are at present followed: the issuance of a warrant in the district where the prosecution is pending; the return of the warrant <em>non est inventus</em>; the filing of a complaint on the basis of the warrant and its return in the district in which the defendant is found; and the issuance of another warrant in the latter district. The warrant originally issued will have efficacy throughout the United States and will constitute authority for arrest<!-- PDFPage:17 -->ing the defendant wherever found. Waite, 27 Jour. of Am. Judicature Soc. 101, 103. The change will not modify or affect the rights of the defendant as to removal. See Rule 40. The authority of the marshal to serve process is not limited to the district for which he is appointed, 28 U.S.C. 503 [now 569].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(3). 1. The provision that the arresting officer need not have the warrant in his possession at the time of the arrest is rendered necessary by the fact that a fugitive may be discovered and apprehended by any one of many officers. It is obviously impossible for a warrant to be in the possession of every officer who is searching for a fugitive or who unexpectedly might find himself in a position to apprehend the fugitive. The rule sets forth the customary practice in such matters, which has the sanction of the courts. &ldquo;It would be a strong proposition in an ordinary felony case to say that a fugitive from justice for whom a capias or warrant was outstanding could not be apprehended until the apprehending officer had physical possession of the capias or the warrant. If such were the law, criminals could circulate freely from one end of the land to the other, because they could always keep ahead of an officer with the warrant.&rdquo; <em>In re Kosopud</em> (N.D. Ohio), 272 F. 330, 336. Waite, 27 Jour. of Am. Judicature Soc. 101, 103. The rule, however, safeguards the defendant's rights in such case.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Service of summons under the rule is substantially the same as in civil actions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4(d)(1) [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(4). Return of a warrant or summons to the commissioner or other officer is provided by 18 U.S.C. 603 [now 4084] (Writs; copy as jailer's authority). The return of all &ldquo;copies of process&rdquo; by the commissioner to the clerk of the court is provided by 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041]; and see Rule 5(c), <em>infra.</em></p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480 (1958) it was held that to support the issuance of a warrant the complaint must contain in addition to a statement &ldquo;of the essential facts constituting the offense&rdquo; (Rule 3) a statement of the facts relied upon by the complainant to establish probable cause. The amendment permits the complainant to state the facts constituting probable cause in a separate affidavit in lieu of spelling them out in the complaint. See also <em>Jaben v. United States</em>, 381 U.S. 214 (1965).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Throughout the rule the term &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;commissioner.&rdquo; Magistrate is defined in rule 54 to include a judge of the United States, a United States magistrate, and those state and local judicial officers specified in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are designed to achieve several objectives: (1) to make explicit the fact that the determination of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence; (2) to make clear that probable cause is a prerequisite to the issuance of a summons; and (3) to give priority to the issuance of a summons rather than a warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) makes clear that the normal situation is to issue a summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) provides for the issuance of an arrest warrant in lieu of or in addition to the issuance of a summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1) restates the provision of the old rule mandating the issuance of a warrant when a defendant fails to appear in response to a summons.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) provides for the issuance of an arrest warrant rather than a summons whenever &ldquo;a valid reason is shown&rdquo; for the issuance of a warrant. The reason may be apparent from the face of the complaint or may be provided by the federal law enforcement officer or attorney for the government. See comparable provision in rule 9.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) deals with the situation in which conditions change after a summons has issued. It affords the government an opportunity to demonstrate the need for an arrest warrant. This may be done in the district in which the defendant is located if this is the convenient place to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that a warrant or summons may issue on the basis of hearsay evidence. What constitutes probable cause is left to be dealt with on a case-to-case basis, taking account of the unlimited variations in source of information and in the opportunity of the informant to perceive accurately the factual data which he furnishes. See <em>e.g., Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480, 78 S.Ct. 1245, 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1958); <em>Aguilar v. Texas</em>, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964); <em>United States v. Ventresca</em>, 380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965); <em>Jaben v. United States</em>, 381 U.S. 214, 85 S.Ct. 1365, 14 L.Ed.2d 345 (1965); <em>McCray v. Illinois</em>, 386 U.S. 300, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967); <em>Spinelli v. United States</em>, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969); <em>United States v. Harris</em>, 403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); Note, The Informer's Tip as Probable Cause for Search or Arrest, 54 Cornell L.Rev. 958 (1969); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;52 (1969, Supp. 1971); 8 S.J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;4.03 (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with arrest procedures when a criminal complaint has been filed. It provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">If it appears&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that there is probable cause&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue to any officer authorized by law to execute it. Upon the <em>request</em> of the attorney for the government a summons instead of a warrant <em>shall</em> issue. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court's amendments make a basic change in Rule 4. As proposed to be amended, Rule 4 gives priority to the issuance of a summons instead of an arrest warrant. In order for the magistrate to issue an arrest warrant, the attorney for the government must show a &ldquo;valid reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee agrees with and approves the basic change in Rule 4. The decision to take a citizen into custody is a very important one with far-reaching consequences. That decision ought to be made by a neutral official (a magistrate) rather than by an interested party (the prosecutor).</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been argued that undesirable consequences will result if this change is adopted&mdash;including an increase in the number of fugitives and the introduction of substantial delays in our system of criminal justice. [See testimony of Assistant Attorney General W. Vincent Rakestraw in Hearings on Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., Serial No. 61, at 41&ndash;43 (1974) [hereinafter cited as &ldquo;Hearing I&rdquo;].] The Committee has carefully considered these arguments and finds them to be wanting. [The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules has thoroughly analyzed the arguments raised by Mr. Rakestraw and convincingly demonstrated that the undesirable consequences predicted will not necessarily result. See Hearings on Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules on Proposed Amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Congress, 1st Session, Serial No. 6, at 208&ndash;09 (1975) [hereinafter cited &ldquo;Hearings II&rdquo;].] The present rule permits the use of a summons in lieu of a warrant. The major difference between the present rule and the proposed rule is that the present rule vests the decision to issue a summons or a warrant in the prosecutor, while the proposed rule <!-- PDFPage:18 -->vests that decision in a judicial officer. Thus, the basic premise underlying the arguments against the proposed rule is the notion that only the prosecutor can be trusted to act responsibly in deciding whether a summons or a warrant shall issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee rejects the notion that the federal judiciary cannot be trusted to exercise discretion wisely and in the public interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee recast the language of Rule 4(b). No change in substance is intended. The phrase &ldquo;valid reason&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;good cause,&rdquo; a phrase with which lawyers are more familiar. [Rule 4, both as proposed by the Supreme Court and as changed by the Committee, does not in any way authorize a magistrate to issue a summons or a warrant sua sponte, nor does it enlarge, limit or change in any way the law governing warrantless arrests.]</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee deleted two sentences from Rule 4(c). These sentences permitted a magistrate to question the complainant and other witnesses under oath and required the magistrate to keep a record or summary of such a proceeding. The Committee does not intend this change to discontinue or discourage the practice of having the complainant appear personally or the practice of making a record or summary of such an appearance. Rather, the Committee intended to leave Rule 4(c) neutral on this matter, neither encouraging nor discouraging these practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added a new section that provides that the determination of good cause for the issuance of a warrant in lieu of a summons shall not be grounds for a motion to suppress evidence. This provision does not apply when the issue is whether there was probable cause to believe an offense has been committed. This provision does not in any way expand or limit the so-called &ldquo;exclusionary rule.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 94&ndash;414; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 4(e)(3) deals with the manner in which warrants and summonses may be served. The House version provides two methods for serving a summons: (1) personal service upon the defendant, or (2) service by leaving it with someone of suitable age at the defendant's dwelling <em>and</em> by mailing it to the defendant's last known address. The Senate version provides three methods: (1) personal service, (2) service by leaving it with someone of suitable age at the defendant's dwelling, or (3) service by mailing it to defendant's last known address.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, an officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, if a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041. If a person arrested without a warrant is brought before a magistrate judge, a complaint, satisfying the probable cause requirements of Rule 4(a), shall be promptly filed. When a person, arrested with or without a warrant or given a summons, appears initially before the magistrate judge, the magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with the applicable subdivisions of this rule. An officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint charging solely a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073 need not comply with this rule if the person arrested is transferred without unnecessary delay to the custody of appropriate state or local authorities in the district of arrest and an attorney for the government moves promptly, in the district in which the warrant was issued, to dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Misdemeanors and Other Petty Offenses</cap-smallcap>. If the charge against the defendant is a misdemeanor or other petty offense triable by a United States magistrate judge under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401, the magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with Rule 58.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Offenses Not Triable by the United States Magistrate Judge</cap-smallcap>. If the charge against the defendant is not triable by the United States magistrate judge, the defendant shall not be called upon to plead. The magistrate judge shall inform the defendant of the complaint against the defendant and of any affidavit filed therewith, of the defendant's right to retain counsel or to request the assignment of counsel if the defendant is unable to obtain counsel, and of the general circumstances under which the defendant may secure pretrial release. The magistrate judge shall inform the defendant that the defendant is not required to make a statement and that any statement made by the defendant may be used against the defendant. The magistrate judge shall also inform the defendant of the right to a preliminary examination. The magistrate judge shall allow the defendant reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel and shall detain or conditionally release the defendant as provided by statute or in these rules.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:19 --><p class="statutory-body">A defendant is entitled to a preliminary examination, unless waived, when charged with any offense, other than a petty offense, which is to be tried by a judge of the district court. If the defendant waives preliminary examination, the magistrate judge shall forthwith hold the defendant to answer in the district court. If the defendant does not waive the preliminary examination, the magistrate judge shall schedule a preliminary examination. Such examination shall be held within a reasonable time but in any event not later than 10 days following the initial appearance if the defendant is in custody and no later than 20 days if the defendant is not in custody, provided, however, that the preliminary examination shall not be held if the defendant is indicted or if an information against the defendant is filed in district court before the date set for the preliminary examination. With the consent of the defendant and upon a showing of good cause, taking into account the public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases, time limits specified in this subdivision may be extended one or more times by a federal magistrate judge. In the absence of such consent by the defendant, time limits may be extended by a judge of the United States only upon a showing that extraordinary circumstances exist and that delay is indispensable to the interests of justice.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The time within which a prisoner must be brought before a committing magistrate is defined differently in different statutes. The rule supersedes all statutory provisions on this point and fixes a single standard, i.e., &ldquo;without unnecessary delay&rdquo;, 18 U.S.C. [former] 593 (Operating illicit distillery; arrest; bail); sec. [former] 595 (Persons arrested taken before nearest officer for hearing); 5 U.S.C. 300a [now 18 U.S.C. 3052, 3107] (Division of Investigation; authority of officers to serve warrants and make arrests); 16 U.S.C. 10 (Arrests by employees of park service for violations of laws and regulations); sec. 706 (Migratory Bird Treaty Act; arrests; search warrants); D.C. Code (1940), Title 4, sec. 140 (Arrests without warrant); see, also, 33 U.S.C. 436, 446, 452; 46 U.S.C. 708 [now 18 U.S.C. 2279]. What constitutes &ldquo;unnecessary delay&rdquo;, i.e., reasonable time within which the prisoner should be brought before a committing magistrate, must be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances of the case. The following authorities discuss the question what constitutes reasonable time for this purpose in various situations: <em>Carroll v. Parry</em>, 48 App.D.C. 453; <em>Janus v. United States</em>, 38 F.2d 431 (C.C.A. 9th); <em>Commonwealth v. Di Stasio</em>, 294 Mass. 273; <em>State v. Freeman</em>, 86 N.C. 683; <em>Peloquin v. Hibner</em>, 231 Wis. 77; see, also, Warner, 28 Va.L.R. 315, 339&ndash;341.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule also states the prevailing state practice, A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), Commentaries to secs. 35, 36.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivisions</em> (b) and (c). 1. These rules prescribe a uniform procedure to be followed at preliminary hearings before a commissioner. They supersede the general provisions of 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial). The procedure prescribed by the rules is that generally prevailing. See <em>Wood v. United States</em>, 128 F.2d 265, 271&ndash;272 (App. D.C.); A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (1931), secs. 39&ndash;60 and Commentaries thereto; <em>Manual for United States Commissioners</em>, pp. 6&ndash;10, published by Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Pleas before a commissioner are excluded, as a plea of guilty at this stage has no legal status or function except to serve as a waiver of preliminary examination. It has been held inadmissible in evidence at the trial, if the defendant was not represented by counsel when the plea was entered. <em>Wood v. United States</em>, 128 F.2d 265 (App. D.C.) The rule expressly provides for a waiver of examination, thereby eliminating any necessity for a provision as to plea.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first change is designed to insure that under the revision made in Rule 4(a) the defendant arrested on a warrant will receive the same information concerning the basis for the issuance of the warrant as would previously have been given him by the complaint itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second change obligates the commissioner to inform the defendant of his right to request the assignment of counsel if he is unable to obtain counsel. Cf. the amendment to Rule 44, and the Advisory Committee's Note thereon.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">There are a number of changes made in rule 5 which are designed to improve the editorial clarity of the rule; to conform the rule to the Federal Magistrates Act; and to deal explicitly in the rule with issues as to which the rule was silent and the law uncertain.</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal editorial change is to deal separately with the initial appearance before the magistrate and the preliminary examination. They are dealt with together in old rule 5. They are separated in order to prevent confusion as to whether they constitute a single or two separate proceedings. Although the preliminary examination can be held at the time of the initial appearance, in practice this ordinarily does not occur. Usually counsel need time to prepare for the preliminary examination and as a consequence a separate date is typically set for the preliminary examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because federal magistrates are reasonably available to conduct initial appearances, the rule is drafted on the assumption that the initial appearance is before a federal magistrate. If experience under the act indicates that there must be frequent appearances before state or local judicial officers it may be desirable to draft an additional rule, such as the following, detailing the procedure for an initial appearance before a state or local judicial officer:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Initial Appearance Before a State or Local Judicial Officer</em>. If a United States magistrate is not reasonably available under rule 5(a), the arrested person shall be brought before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041, and such officer shall inform the person of the rights specified in rule 5(c) and shall authorize the release of the arrested person under the terms provided for by these rules and by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146. The judicial officer shall immediately transmit any written order of release and any papers filed before him to the appropriate United States magistrate of the district and order the arrested person to appear before such United States magistrate within three days if not in custody or at the next regular hour of business of the United States magistrate if the arrested person is retained in custody. Upon his appearance before the United States magistrate, the procedure shall be that prescribed in rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several changes are made to conform the language of the rule to the Federal Magistrates Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The term &ldquo;magistrate,&rdquo; which is defined in new rule 54, is substituted for the term &ldquo;commissioner.&rdquo; As defined, &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; includes those state and local judicial officers specified in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041, and thus the initial appearance may be before a state or local judicial officer when a federal magistrate is not reasonably available. This is made explicit in subdivision (a).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:20 --><p class="note-body">(2) Subdivision (b) conforms the rule to the procedure prescribed in the Federal Magistrate Act when a defendant appears before a magistrate charged with a &ldquo;minor offense&rdquo; as defined in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(f):</p>
<p class="note-body-block">&ldquo;misdemeanors punishable under the laws of the United States, the penalty for which does not exceed imprisonment for a period of one year, or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both, except that such term does not include .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [specified exceptions].&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">If the &ldquo;minor offense&rdquo; is tried before a United States magistrate, the procedure must be in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before United States Magistrates, (January 27, 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Subdivision (d) makes clear that a defendant is not entitled to a preliminary examination if he has been indicted by a grand jury prior to the date set for the preliminary examination or, in appropriate cases, if any information is filed in the district court prior to that date. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80, pp. 137&ndash;140 (1969, Supp. 1971). This is also provided in the Federal Magistrates Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5 is also amended to deal with several issues not dealt with in old rule 5:</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to make clear that a complaint, complying with the requirements of rule 4(a), must be filed whenever a person has been arrested without a warrant. This means that the complaint, or an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint, must show probable cause. As provided in rule 4(a) the showing of probable cause &ldquo;may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that defendant should be notified of the general circumstances under which he is entitled to pretrial release under the Bail Reform Act of 1966 (18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3141&ndash;3152). Defendants often do not in fact have counsel at the initial appearance and thus, unless told by the magistrate, may be unaware of their right to pretrial release. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;78 N. 61 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) makes clear that a defendant who does not waive his right to trial before a judge of the district court is entitled to a preliminary examination to determine probable cause for any offense except a petty offense. It also, by necessary implication, makes clear that a defendant is not entitled to a preliminary examination if he consents to be tried on the issue of guilt or innocence by the United States magistrate, even though the offense may be one not heretofore triable by the United States commissioner and therefore one as to which the defendant had a right to a preliminary examination. The rationale is that the preliminary examination serves only to justify holding the defendant in custody or on bail during the period of time it takes to bind the defendant over to the district court for trial. See <em>State v. Solomon</em>, 158 Wis. 146, 147 N.W. 640 (1914). A similar conclusion is reached in the New York Proposed Criminal Procedure Law. See McKinney's Session Law News, April 10, 1969, at p. A&ndash;119.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) also contains time limits within which the preliminary examination must be held. These are taken from 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060. The provisions for the extension of the prescribed time limits are the same as the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060 with two exceptions: The new language allows delay consented to by the defendant only if there is &ldquo;a showing of good cause, taking into account the public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases.&rdquo; This reflects the view of the Advisory Committee that delay, whether prosecution or defense induced, ought to be avoided whenever possible. The second difference between the new rule and 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060 is that the rule allows the decision to grant a continuance to be made by a United States magistrate as well as by a judge of the United States. This reflects the view of the Advisory Committee that the United States magistrate should have sufficient judicial competence to make decisions such as that contemplated in subdivision (c).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of subdivision (b) reflects the recent amendment of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(a), by the Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, to read: &ldquo;When specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or courts he serves, any United States magistrate shall have jurisdiction to try persons accused of, and sentence persons convicted of, misdemeanors committed within that judicial district.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1990 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5(b) is amended to conform the rule to Rule 58.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1995 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 5 is intended to address the interplay between the requirements for a prompt appearance before a magistrate judge and the processing of persons arrested for the offense of unlawfully fleeing to avoid prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073, when no federal prosecution is intended. Title 18 U.S.C. &sect;1073 provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Whoever moves or travels in interstate or foreign commerce with intent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, under the laws of the place from which he flees .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Violations of this section may be prosecuted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only upon formal approval in writing by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General of the United States, which function of approving prosecutions may not be delegated.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">In enacting &sect;1073, Congress apparently intended to provide assistance to state criminal justice authorities in an effort to apprehend and prosecute state offenders. It also appears that by requiring permission of high ranking officials, Congress intended that prosecutions be limited in number. In fact, prosecutions under this section have been rare. The purpose of the statute is fulfilled when the person is apprehended and turned over to state or local authorities. In such cases the requirement of Rule 5 that any person arrested under a federal warrant must be brought before a federal magistrate judge becomes a largely meaningless exercise and a needless demand upon federal judicial resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addressing this problem, several options are available to federal authorities when no federal prosecution is intended to ensue after the arrest. First, once federal authorities locate a fugitive, they may contact local law enforcement officials who make the arrest based upon the underlying out-of-state warrant. In that instance, Rule 5 is not implicated and the United States Attorney in the district issuing the &sect;1073 complaint and warrant can take action to dismiss both. In a second scenario, the fugitive is arrested by federal authorities who, in compliance with Rule 5, bring the person before a federal magistrate judge. If local law enforcement officers are present, they can take custody, once the United States Attorney informs the magistrate judge that there will be no prosecution under <!-- PDFPage:21 -->&sect;1073. Depending on the availability of state or local officers, there may be some delay in the Rule 5 proceedings; any delays following release to local officials, however, would not be a function of Rule 5. In a third situation, federal authorities arrest the fugitive but local law enforcement authorities are not present at the Rule 5 appearance. Depending on a variety of practices, the magistrate judge may calendar a removal hearing under Rule 40, or order that the person be held in federal custody pending further action by the local authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the amendment, officers arresting a fugitive charged only with violating &sect;1073 need not bring the person before a magistrate judge under Rule 5(a) if there is no intent to actually prosecute the person under that charge. Two requirements, however, must be met. First, the arrested fugitive must be transferred without unnecessary delay to the custody of state officials. Second, steps must be taken in the appropriate district to dismiss the complaint alleging a violation of &sect;1073. The rule continues to contemplate that persons arrested by federal officials are entitled to prompt handling of federal charges, if prosecution is intended, and prompt transfer to state custody if federal prosecution is not contemplated.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Probable Cause Finding</cap-smallcap>. If from the evidence it appears that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it, the federal magistrate judge shall forthwith hold the defendant to answer in district court. The finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part. The defendant may cross-examine adverse witnesses and may introduce evidence. Objections to evidence on the ground that it was acquired by unlawful means are not properly made at the preliminary examination. Motions to suppress must be made to the trial court as provided in Rule 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Discharge of Defendant</cap-smallcap>. If from the evidence it appears that there is no probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed or that the defendant committed it, the federal magistrate judge shall dismiss the complaint and discharge the defendant. The discharge of the defendant shall not preclude the government from instituting a subsequent prosecution for the same offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Records</cap-smallcap>. After concluding the proceeding the federal magistrate judge shall transmit forthwith to the clerk of the district court all papers in the proceeding. The magistrate judge shall promptly make or cause to be made a record or summary of such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) On timely application to a federal magistrate judge, the attorney for a defendant in a criminal case may be given the opportunity to have the recording of the hearing on preliminary examination made available to that attorney in connection with any further hearing or preparation for trial. The court may, by local rule, appoint the place for and define the conditions under which such opportunity may be afforded counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) On application of a defendant addressed to the court or any judge thereof, an order may issue that the federal magistrate judge make available a copy of the transcript, or of a portion thereof, to defense counsel. Such order shall provide for prepayment of costs of such transcript by the defendant unless the defendant makes a sufficient affidavit that the defendant is unable to pay or to give security therefor, in which case the expense shall be paid by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from available appropriated funds. Counsel for the government may move also that a copy of the transcript, in whole or in part, be made available to it, for good cause shown, and an order may be entered granting such motion in whole or in part, on appropriate terms, except that the government need not prepay costs nor furnish security therefor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Sanctions for Failure to Produce Statement</em>. If a party elects not to comply with an order under Rule 26.2(a) to deliver a statement to the moving party, the court may not consider the testimony of a witness whose statement is withheld.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 5.1 is, for the most part, a clarification of old rule 5(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the new rule, the preliminary examination must be conducted before a &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; as defined in rule 54. Giving state or local judicial officers authority to conduct a preliminary examination does not seem necessary. There are not likely to be situations in which a &ldquo;federal magistrate&rdquo; is not &ldquo;reasonably available&rdquo; to conduct the preliminary examination, which is usually not held until several days after the initial appearance provided for in rule 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) makes clear that a finding of probable cause may be based on &ldquo;hearsay evidence in whole or in part.&rdquo; The propriety of relying upon hearsay at the preliminary examination has been a matter of some uncertainty in the federal system. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 (1969, Supp. 1971); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;504[4] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971); <em>Washington v. Clemmer</em>, 339 F.2d 715, 719 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Washington v. Clemmer</em>, 339 F.2d 725, 728 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Ross v. Sirica</em>, 380 F.2d 557, 565 (D.C. Cir. 1967); <em>Howard v. United States</em>, 389 F.2d 287, 292 (D.C. Cir. 1967); Weinberg and Weinberg, The Congressional Invitation to Avoid the Preliminary Hearing: An Analysis of Section 303 of the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, 67 Mich.L.Rev. 1361, especially n. 92 at 1383 (1969); D. Wright, The Rules of Evidence Applicable to Hearings in Probable Cause, 37 Conn.B.J. 561 (1963); Comment, Preliminary Examination&mdash;Evidence and Due Process, 15 Kan.L.Rev. 374, 379&ndash;381 (1967).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:22 --><p class="note-body">A grand jury indictment may properly be based upon hearsay evidence. <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359 (1956); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;6.03[2] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971). This being so, there is practical advantage in making the evidentiary requirements for the preliminary examination as flexible as they are for the grand jury. Otherwise there will be increased pressure upon United States Attorneys to abandon the preliminary examination in favor of the grand jury indictment. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 at p. 143 (1969). New York State, which also utilizes both the preliminary examination and the grand jury, has under consideration a new Code of Criminal Procedure which would allow the use of hearsay at the preliminary examination. See McKinney's Session Law News, April 10, 1969, pp. A119&ndash;A120.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the same reason, subdivision (a) also provides that the preliminary examination is not the proper place to raise the issue of illegally obtained evidence. This is current law. In <em>Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480, 484 (1958), the Supreme Court said:</p>
<p class="note-body-block">[T]he Commissioner here had no authority to adjudicate the admissibility at petitioner's later trial of the heroin taken from his person. That issue was for the trial court. This is specifically recognized by Rule 41(e) of the Criminal Rules, which provides that a defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may &ldquo;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* move the district court *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to suppress for use as evidence anything so obtained on the ground that *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; the arrest warrant was defective on any of several grounds.</p>
<p class="note-body">Dicta in <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359, 363&ndash;364 (1956), and <em>United States v. Blue</em>, 384 U.S. 251, 255 (1966), also support the proposed rule. In <em>United States ex rel. Almeida v. Rundle</em>, 383 F.2d 421, 424 (3d Cir. 1967), the court, in considering the adequacy of an indictment said:</p>
<p class="note-body">On this score, it is settled law that (1) &ldquo;[an] indictment returned by a legally constituted nonbiased grand jury, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is enough to call for a trial of the charge on the merits and satisfies the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.&rdquo;, <em>Lawn v. United States</em>, 355 U.S. 399, 349, 78 S.Ct. 311, 317, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958); (2) an indictment cannot be challenged &ldquo;on the ground that there was inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury&rdquo;, <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 408, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956); and (3) a prosecution is not abated, nor barred, even where &ldquo;tainted evidence&rdquo; has been submitted to a grand jury, <em>United States v. Blue</em>, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;80 at 143 n. 5 (1969, Supp. 1971) 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;6.03[3] (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971). The Manual for United States Commissioners (Administrative Office of United States Courts, 1948) provides at pp. 24&ndash;25: &ldquo;Motions for this purpose [to suppress illegally obtained evidence] may be made and heard only before a district judge. Commissioners are not empowered to consider or act upon such motions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been urged that the rules of evidence at the preliminary examination should be those applicable at the trial because the purpose of the preliminary examination should be, not to review the propriety of the arrest or prior detention, but rather to determine whether there is evidence sufficient to justify subjecting the defendant to the expense and inconvenience of trial. See Weinberg and Weinberg, The Congressional Invitation to Avoid the Preliminary Hearing: An Analysis of Section 303 of the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, 67 Mich. L. Rev. 1361, 1396&ndash;1399 (1969). The rule rejects this view for reasons largely of administrative necessity and the efficient administration of justice. The Congress has decided that a preliminary examination shall not be required when there is a grand jury indictment (18 U.S.C. &sect;3060). Increasing the procedural and evidentiary requirements applicable to the preliminary examination will therefore add to the administrative pressure to avoid the preliminary examination. Allowing objections to evidence on the ground that evidence has been illegally obtained would require two determinations of admissibility, one before the United States magistrate and one in the district court. The objective is to reduce, not increase, the number of preliminary motions.</p>
<p class="note-body">To provide that a probable cause finding may be based upon hearsay does not preclude the magistrate from requiring a showing that admissible evidence will be available at the time of trial. See Comment, Criminal Procedure&mdash;Grand Jury&mdash;Validity of Indictment Based Solely on Hearsay Questioned When Direct Testimony Is Readily Available, 43 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 578 (1968); <em>United States v. Umans</em>, 368 F.2d. 725 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted 389 U.S. 80 (1967); <em>United States v. Andrews</em>, 381 F.2d 377, 378 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>United States v. Messina</em>, 388 F.2d 393, 394 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1968); and <em>United States v. Beltram</em>. 388 F.2d 449 (2d Cir. 1968); and <em>United States v. Arcuri</em>, 282 F.Supp. 347 (E.D.N.Y. 1968). The fact that a defendant is not entitled to object to evidence alleged to have been illegally obtained does not deprive him of an opportunity for a pretrial determination of the admissibility of evidence. He can raise such an objection prior to trial in accordance with the provisions of rule 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) makes it clear that the United States magistrate may not only discharge the defendant but may also dismiss the complaint. Current federal law authorizes the magistrate to discharge the defendant but he must await authorization from the United States Attorney before he can close his records on the case by dismissing the complaint. Making dismissal of the complaint a separate procedure accomplishes no worthwhile objective, and the new rule makes it clear that the magistrate can both discharge the defendant and file the record with the clerk.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) also deals with the legal effect of a discharge of a defendant at a preliminary examination. This issue is not dealt with explicitly in the old rule. Existing federal case law is limited. What cases there are seem to support the right of the government to issue a new complaint and start over. See <em>e.q., Collins v. Loisel</em>, 262 U.S. 426 (1923); <em>Morse v. United States</em>, 267 U.S. 80 (1925). State law is similar. See <em>People v. Dillon</em>, 197 N.Y. 254, 90 N.E. 820 (1910; <em>Tell v. Wolke</em>, 21 Wis.2d 613, 124 N.W.2d 655 (1963). In the <em>Tell</em> case the Wisconsin court stated the common rationale for allowing the prosecutor to issue a new complaint and start over:</p>
<p class="note-body">The state has no appeal from errors of law committed by a magistrate upon preliminary examination and the discharge on a preliminary would operate as an unchallengeable acquittal.  The only way an error of law committed on the preliminary examination prejudicial to the state may be challenged or corrected is by a preliminary examination on a second complaint. (21 Wis. 2d at 619&ndash;620.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is based upon old rule 5(c) and upon the Federal Magistrates Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3060(f). It provides methods for making available to counsel the record of the preliminary examination. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;82 (1969, Supp. 1971). The new rule is designed to eliminate delay and expense occasioned by preparation of transcripts where listening to the tape recording would be sufficient. Ordinarily the recording should be made available pursuant to subdivision (c)(1). A written transcript may be provided under subdivision (c)(2) at the discretion of the court, a discretion which must be exercised in accordance with <em>Britt v. North Carolina</em>, 404 U.S. 226, 30 L.Ed.2d 400, 405 (1971):</p>
<p class="note-body">A defendant who claims the right to a free transcript does not, under our cases, bear the burden of proving inadequate such alternatives as may be suggested by the State or conjured up by a court in hindsight. In this case, however, petitioner has conceded that he had available an informal alternative which appears to be substantially equivalent to a transcript. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court below was in error in rejecting his claim.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The addition of subdivision (d) mirrors similar amendments made in 1993 which extended the scope of Rule 26.2 to Rules 32, 32.1, 46 and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. As indicated in the Committee Notes accompanying those amendments, the primary reason for extending the coverage of Rule 26.2 rested heavily upon the compelling need for accurate information affecting a witness&rsquo; credibility. That need, the Committee believes, extends to a preliminary examination under this rule where both the prosecution and the defense have high interests at stake.</p>
<p class="note-body">A witness&rsquo; statement must be produced only after the witness has personally testified.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 5.1 After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Committee made no changes to the published draft.</p>
