<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 581 and 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. &sect;&sect;5187, 5209; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, &sect;7, 40 Stat. 972; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;316, 49 Stat. 712).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates section 581 and part of section 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provision was drawn from said section 592 as being the latest expression of congressional intent, in preference to the provision of said section 581 which authorized a fine &ldquo;not more than double the amount so countersigned and delivered and imprisonment not more than 15 years&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;shall be guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Likewise the words &ldquo;upon conviction in any district court of the United States&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary since punishment can follow only after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">(See reviser's note under section 656 of this title for statement of reasons for dividing said section 592 into three revised sections, with consequent changes in phraseology, style, and arrangement.)</p>
