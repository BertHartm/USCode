<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;469&ndash;474 (June 11, 1940, ch. 326, &sect;&sect;1&ndash;3, 54 Stat. 306; Mar. 4, 1944, ch. 82, &sect;&sect;1&ndash;4, 58 Stat. 111; Apr. 10, 1944, ch. 162, 58 Stat. 188).</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections consolidated and rewritten with changes of phraseology and substance.</p>
<p class="note-body">In section 469 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., the element of intent not to pay for transportation was omitted as <!-- PDFPage:428 -->unnecessary since the payment of transportation will invariably remove the stowaway from the operation of the section by purchasing the master's &ldquo;consent&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In section 472 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., the enumerations of State, Territory, Possession, District of Columbia, and The Canal Zone, was omitted as adequately covered by &ldquo;place within the jurisdiction of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provision is the same as in sections 470, 472, and 473 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., but the fine is $500 more than the maximum fine provided by said section 469. There seemed no point, however, in preserving a differential in favor of the stowaway as against the aider and abettor of $500. The court can be trusted to exercise a wise discretion within the slightly larger limits provided by the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision for punishment of aiders and abettors in section 470 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as unnecessary since they are punishable as principals by section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sections 471 and 474 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as obviously unnecessary.</p>
