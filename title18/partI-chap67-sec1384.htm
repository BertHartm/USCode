<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;518a (July 11, 1941, ch. 287, 55 Stat. 583; May 15, 1945, ch. 126, 59 Stat. 168; May 15, 1946, ch. 258, 60 Stat. 182).</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;whoever&rdquo; was substituted for the words &ldquo;person, corporation, partnership, or association&rdquo; in conformity with section 1 of title 1, U.S.C., 1940 ed., General Provisions, as amended and without change of substance.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions with reference to punishment of persons subject to military or naval law as provided in the Articles of War and the Articles for the Government of the Navy were omitted, as was the exception of such persons from the punishment provisions of this section. The Articles of War and Articles for the Government of the Navy are sufficiently complete in themselves to authorize the adequate punishment of military or naval personnel for violations of general criminal statutes as well as for disobedience of orders. See Articles of War, Article 96, section 1568 of title 10, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Army, and Articles for the Government of the Navy, Articles 1, 4, 22, 23, section 1200, of title 34, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Navy.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section, in this respect, places violations on the same basis as other misdemeanors in violation of the general statutes of the United States and authorizes punishment of persons subject to military or naval law under such law, or in case the military or naval authorities turn the violator over to the civil authorities, the trial and punishment may be under the general law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;and/or&rdquo; appearing twice in section 581a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was deleted to avoid uncertainty and ambiguity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; were omitted because of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>

<p class="note-body">2. In the second paragraph, substitutes &ldquo;The Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; for &ldquo;The Secretaries of the Army, and Navy&rdquo;, for the same reason given in item 1 above.</p>
