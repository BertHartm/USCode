<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;550 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;332, 35 Stat. 1152).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2(a) comprises section 550 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change except in minor matters of phraseology.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2(b) is added to permit the deletion from many sections throughout the revision of such phrases as &ldquo;causes or procures&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The section as revised makes clear the legislative intent to punish as a principal not only one who directly commits an offense and one who &ldquo;aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures&rdquo; another to commit an offense, but also anyone who causes the doing of an act which if done by him directly would render him guilty of an offense against the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">It removes all doubt that one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal enterprise but causes the commission of an indispensable element of the offense by an innocent agent or instrumentality, is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">This accords with the following decisions: <em>Rothenburg v. United States</em>, 1918, 38 S. Ct. 18, 245 U.S. 480, 62 L. Ed. 414, and <em>United States v. Hodorowicz</em>, C. C.

<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;451 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;272, 35 Stat. 1142; June 11, 1940, ch. 323, 54 Stat. 304).</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;The term &lsquo;special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States&rsquo; as used in this title includes:&rdquo; were substituted for the words &ldquo;The crimes and offenses defined in sections 451&ndash;468 of this title shall be punished as herein prescribed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">This section first appeared in the 1909 Criminal Code. It made it possible to combine in one chapter all the penal provisions covering acts within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction without the necessity of repeating in each section the places covered.</p>
<p class="note-body">The present section has made possible the allocation of the diverse provisions of chapter 11 of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to particular chapters restricted to particular offenses, as contemplated by the alphabetical chapter arrangement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In several revised sections of said chapter 11 the words &ldquo;within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; have been added. Thus the jurisdictional limitation will be preserved in all sections of said chapter 11 describing an offense.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:12 --><p class="note-body">Enumeration of names of Great Lakes was omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other minor changes were necessary now that the section defines a term rather than the place of commission of crime or offense; however, the extent of the special jurisdiction as originally enacted has been carefully followed.</p>

<p class="note-body">Act March 4, 1909, &sect;289 used the words &ldquo;now in force&rdquo; when referring to the laws of any State, organized Territory or district, to be considered in force.</p>
<p class="note-body">As amended on June 15, 1933, the words &ldquo;by the laws thereof in force on June 1, 1933, and remaining in force at the time of the doing or omitting the doing of such act or thing, would be penal,&rdquo; were used.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment of June 20, 1935, extended the date to &ldquo;April 1, 1935,&rdquo; and the amendment of June 6, 1940, extended the date to &ldquo;February 1, 1940&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section omits the specification of any date as unnecessary in a revision, which speaks from the date of its enactment. Such omission will not only make effective within Federal reservations, the local State laws in force on the date of the enactment of the revision, but will authorize the Federal courts to apply the same measuring stick to such offenses as is applied in the adjoining State under future changes of the State law and will make unnecessary periodic pro forma amendments of this section to keep abreast of changes of local laws. In other words, the revised section makes applicable to offenses committed on such reservations, the law of the place that would govern if the reservation had not been ceded to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;Possession&rdquo; was inserted to clarify scope of section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Senate Revision Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amendment, adding a new section 14, together with amended section 5 will clarify the applicability of Federal criminal statutes within the Canal Zone. It was particularly desired by the Governor of the Canal Zone and the compiler of the Canal Zone Code. The Governor of the Canal Zone, in a letter dated September 22, 1945, and filed with the House Judiciary Committee, advised:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;General criminal laws of the United States are now applicable to the Canal Zone only if applicability is indicated by language expressly referring to the Canal Zone, or to possessions of the United States, or to territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, etc. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The bill in its present form would have undesirable effects insofar as concerns the continued operation of the Canal Zone Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, established by Congress as titles 5 and 6 of the Canal Zone Code, enacted by act of June 19, 1934 (ch. 667, 48 Stat. 1122), and also would perhaps have undesirable effects insofar as concerns the continued applicability to the Canal Zone of the body of general criminal laws which are now applicable.&rdquo;</p>
