<!-- field-end:sourcecredit -->
<!-- field-start:notes -->
<!-- field-start:historicalandrevision-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;584 (R.S. &sect;1046; July 5, 1884, ch. 225, &sect;2, 23 Stat. 122).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;customs laws&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;revenue laws,&rdquo; since different limitations are provided for internal revenue violations by section 3748 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section was held to apply to offenses under the customs laws. Those offenses are within the term &ldquo;revenue laws&rdquo; but not within the term &ldquo;internal revenue laws&rdquo;. <em>United States v. Hirsch</em> (1879, 100 U.S. 33, 25 L. Ed. 539), <em>United States v. Shorey</em> (1869, Fed. Cas. No. 16,282), and <em>United States v. Platt</em> (1840, Fed. Cas. No. 16,054a) applied this section in customs cases. Hence it appears that there was no proper basis for the complete elimination from section 584 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., of the reference to revenue laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Meaning of &ldquo;revenue laws&rdquo;. <em>United States v. Norton</em> (1876, 91 U.S. 566, 23 L.Ed. 454), quoting Webster that &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;The income of a nation, derived from its taxes, duties, or other sources, for the payment of the national expenses.&rdquo; Quoting <em>United States v. Mayo</em> (1813, Fed. Cas. No. 15,755) that &ldquo;revenue laws&rdquo; meant such laws &ldquo;as are made for the direct and avowed purpose of creating revenue or public funds for the service of the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Definition of revenue. &ldquo;Revenue&rdquo; is the income of a State, and the revenue of the Post Office Department, being raised by a tax on mailable matter conveyed in the mail, and which is disbursed in the public service, is as much a part of the income of the government as moneys collected for duties on imports (<em>United States v. Bromley</em>, 53 U.S. 88, 99, 13 L. Ed. 905).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Revenue&rdquo; is the product or fruit of taxation. It matters not in what form the power of taxation may be exercised or to what subjects it may be applied, its exercise is intended to provide means for the support of the Government, and the means provided are necessarily to be regarded as the internal revenue. Duties upon imports are imposed for the same general object and, because they are so imposed, the money thus produced is considered revenue, not because it is derived from any particular source (<em>United States v. Wright</em>, 1870, Fed. Cas. No. 16,770).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Revenue law&rdquo; is defined as a law for direct object of imposing and collecting taxes, dues, imports, and excises for government and its purposes (<em>In re Mendenhall</em>, D.C. Mont. 1935, 10 F. Supp. 122).</p>
<p class="note-body">Act Cong. March 2, 1799, ch. 22, 1 Stat. 627, regulating the collection of duties on imports, is a revenue law, within the meaning of act Cong. April 18, 1818, ch. 70, 3 Stat. 433, providing for the mode of suing for and recovering penalties and forfeitures for violations of the revenue laws of the United States (<em>The Abigail</em>, 1824, Fed. Cas. No. 18).</p>

Prior to amendment, text read as follows: &ldquo;No person shall be prosecuted, tried or punished for any violation of the customs laws or the slave trade laws of the United States unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within five years next after the commission of the offense.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;590a (Aug. 24, 1942, ch. 555, &sect;1, 56 Stat. 747; July 1, 1944, ch. 358, &sect;19(b), 58 Stat. 667; Oct. 3, 1944, ch. 479, &sect;28, 58 Stat. 781).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;when the United States is at war&rdquo; was inserted at the beginning of this section to make it permanent instead of temporary legislation, and to obviate the necessity of reenacting such legislation in the future. This permitted the elimination of references to dates and to the provision limiting the application of the section to transactions not yet fully barred. When the provisions of the War Contract Settlements Act of 1944, upon which this section is based, are considered in connection with said section 590a which it amends, it is obvious that no purpose can be served now by the provisions omitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Phrase (2), reading &ldquo;or committed in connection with the acquisition, care, handling, custody, control or disposition of any real or personal property of the United States&rdquo; was derived from section 28 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 which amended said section 590a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. This act is temporary by its terms and relates only to offenses committed in the disposition of surplus property thereunder.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section extends its provisions to all offenses involving the disposition of any property, real or personal, of the United States. This extension is more apparent than real since phrase (2), added as the result of said Act, was merely a more specific statement of offenses embraced in phrase (1) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section is written in general terms as permanent legislation applicable whenever the United States is at war. (See, also, reviser's note under section 284 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of title 41, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts.</p>
