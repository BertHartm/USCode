<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>By Attorney for Government</cap-smallcap>. The Attorney General or the United States attorney may by leave of court file a dismissal of an indictment, information or complaint and the prosecution shall thereupon terminate. Such a dismissal may not be filed during the trial without the consent of the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>By Court</cap-smallcap>. If there is unnecessary delay in presenting the charge to a grand jury or in filing an information against a defendant who has been held to answer to the district court, or if there is unnecessary delay in bringing a defendant to trial, the court may dismiss the indictment, information or complaint.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The first sentence of this rule will change existing law. The common-law rule that the public prosecutor may enter a <em>nolle prosequi</em> in his discretion, without any action by the court, prevails in the Federal courts, <em>Confiscation Cases</em>, 7 Wall. 454, 457; <em>United States v. Woody</em>, 2 F.2d 262 (D.Mont.). This provision will permit the filing of a nolle prosequi only by leave of court. This is similar to the rule now prevailing in many States. A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure, Commentaries, pp. 895&ndash;897.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule confers the power to file a dismissal by leave of court on the Attorney General, as well as on the United States attorney, since under existing law the Attorney General exercises &ldquo;general superintendence and direction&rdquo; over the United States attorneys &ldquo;as to the manner of discharging their respective duties,&rdquo; 5 U.S.C. 317 [now 28 U.S.C. 509, 547]. Moreover it is the administrative practice for the Attorney General to supervise the filing of a <em>nolle prosequi</em> by United States attorneys. Consequently it seemed appropriate that the Attorney General should have such power directly.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The rule permits the filing of a dismissal of an indictment, information or complaint. The word &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; was included in order to resolve a doubt prevailing in some districts as to whether the United States attorney may file a <em>nolle prosequi</em> between the time when the defendant is bound over by the United States commissioner and the finding of an indictment. It has been assumed in a few districts that the power does not exist and that the United States attorney must await action of the grand jury, even if he deems it proper to dismiss the prosecution. This situation is an unnecessary hardship to some defendants.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The second sentence is a restatement of existing law, <em>Confiscation Cases</em>, 7 Wall. 454&ndash;457; <em>United States v. Shoemaker</em>, 27 Fed. Cases No. 16, 279 (C.C.Ill.). If the trial has commenced, the defendant has a right to insist on a disposition on the merits and may properly object to the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule is a restatement of the inherent power of the court to dismiss a case for want of prosecution. <em>Ex parte Altman</em>, 34 F.Supp. 106 (S.D.Cal.).</p>
