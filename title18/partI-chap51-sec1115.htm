<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;461 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;282, 35 Stat. 1144).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section restores the intent of the original enactments, R.S. &sect;5344, and act Mar. 3, 1905, ch. 1454, &sect;5, 33 Stat. 1025, and makes this section one of general application. In the Criminal Code of 1909, by placing it in chapter 11, limited to places within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, such original intent was inadvertently lost as indicated by the entire absence of report or comment on such limitation.</p>
