<h3 class="section-head">Rule 11. Pleas</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Alternatives.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General</em>. A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty, or nolo contendere. If a defendant refuses to plead or if a defendant corporation fails to appear, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Conditional Pleas</em>. With the approval of the court and the consent of the government, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the judgment, to review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. A defendant who prevails on appeal shall be allowed to withdraw the plea.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Nolo Contendere</cap-smallcap>. A defendant may plead nolo contendere only with the consent of the court. Such a plea shall be accepted by the court only after due consideration of the views of the parties and the interest of the public in the effective administration of justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Defendant</cap-smallcap>. Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law, including the effect of any special parole or supervised release term, the fact that the court is required to consider any applicable sentencing guidelines but may depart from those guidelines under some circumstances, and, when applicable, that the court may also order the defendant to make restitution to any victim of the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the defendant is not represented by an attorney, that the defendant has the right to be represented by an attorney at every stage of the proceeding and, if necessary, one will be appointed to represent the defendant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that the defendant has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if it has already been made, the right to be tried by a jury and at that trial the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and the right against compelled self-incrimination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that if a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted by the court there will not be a further trial of any kind, so that by pleading guilty or nolo contendere the defendant waives the right to a trial; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if the court intends to question the defendant under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel about the offense to which the defendant has pleaded, that the defendant's answers may later be used against the defendant in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Insuring That the Plea Is Voluntary</cap-smallcap>. The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or <!-- PDFPage:39 -->nolo contendere without first, by addressing the defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement. The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant's willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or the defendant's attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Plea Agreement Procedure.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General</em>. The attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se may engage in discussions with a view toward reaching an agreement that, upon the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a charged offense or to a lesser or related offense, the attorney for the government will do any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) move for dismissal of other charges; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) make a recommendation, or agree not to oppose the defendant's request, for a particular sentence, with the understanding that such recommendation or request shall not be binding upon the court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall not participate in any such discussions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Notice of Such Agreement</em>. If a plea agreement has been reached by the parties, the court shall, on the record, require the disclosure of the agreement in open court or, on a showing of good cause, in camera, at the time the plea is offered. If the agreement is of the type specified in subdivision (e)(1)(A) or (C), the court may accept or reject the agreement, or may defer its decision as to the acceptance or rejection until there has been an opportunity to consider the presentence report. If the agreement is of the type specified in subdivision (e)(1)(B), the court shall advise the defendant that if the court does not accept the recommendation or request the defendant nevertheless has no right to withdraw the plea.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Acceptance of a Plea Agreement</em>. If the court accepts the plea agreement, the court shall inform the defendant that it will embody in the judgment and sentence the disposition provided for in the plea agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Rejection of a Plea Agreement</em>. If the court rejects the plea agreement, the court shall, on the record, inform the parties of this fact, advise the defendant personally in open court or, on a showing of good cause, in camera, that the court is not bound by the plea agreement, afford the defendant the opportunity to then withdraw the plea, and advise the defendant that if the defendant persists in a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere the disposition of the case may be less favorable to the defendant than that contemplated by the plea agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Time of Plea Agreement Procedure</em>. Except for good cause shown, notification to the court of the existence of a plea agreement shall be given at the arraignment or at such other time, prior to trial, as may be fixed by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements</em>. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, evidence of the following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a plea of nolo contendere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any statement made in the course of any proceedings under this rule regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the government which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Determining Accuracy of Plea</cap-smallcap>. Notwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court should not enter a judgment upon such plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Record of Proceedings</cap-smallcap>. A verbatim record of the proceedings at which the defendant enters a plea shall be made and, if there is a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the record shall include, without limitation, the court's advice to the defendant, the inquiry into the voluntariness of the plea including any plea agreement, and the inquiry into the accuracy of a guilty plea.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Harmless Error</cap-smallcap>. Any variance from the procedures required by this rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law and practice, 18 U.S.C. [former] 564 (Standing mute); <em>Fogus v. United States</em>, 34 F.2d 97 (C.C.A. 4th) (duty of court to ascertain that plea of guilty is intelligently and voluntarily made).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The plea of <em>nolo contendere</em> has always existed in the Federal courts, <em>Hudson v. United States</em>, 272 U.S. 451; <em>United States v. Norris</em>, 281 U.S. 619. The use of the plea is recognized by the Probation Act, 18 U.S.C. 724 [now 3651]. While at times criticized as theoretically lacking in logical basis, experience has shown that it performs a useful function from a practical standpoint.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The great majority of all defendants against whom indictments or informations are filed in the federal <!-- PDFPage:40 -->courts plead guilty. Only a comparatively small number go to trial. See United States Attorneys Statistical Report, Fiscal Year 1964, p. 1. The fairness and adequacy of the procedures on acceptance of pleas of guilty are of vital importance in according equal justice to all in the federal courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Three changes are made in the second sentence. The first change makes it clear that before accepting either a plea of guilty or nolo contendere the court must determine that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge. The second change expressly requires the court to address the defendant personally in the course of determining that the plea is made voluntarily and with understanding of the nature of the charge. The reported cases reflect some confusion over this matter. Compare <em>United States v. Diggs</em>, 304 F.2d 929 (6th Cir. 1962); <em>Domenica v. United States</em>, 292 F.2d 483 (1st Cir. 1961); <em>Gundlach v. United States</em>, 262 F.2d 72 (4th Cir. 1958), cert. den., 360 U.S. 904 (1959); and <em>Julian v. United States</em>, 236 F.2d 155 (6th Cir. 1956), which contain the implication that personal interrogation of the defendant is the better practice even when he is represented by counsel, with <em>Meeks v. United States</em>, 298 F.2d 204 (5th Cir. 1962); <em>Nunley v. United States</em>, 294 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1961), cert. den., 368 U.S. 991 (1962); and <em>United States v. Von der Heide</em>, 169 F.Supp. 560 (D.D.C. 1959).</p>
<p class="note-body">The third change in the second sentence adds the words &ldquo;and the consequences of his plea&rdquo; to state what clearly is the law. See, e.g., <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies</em>, 332 U.S. 708, 724 (1948); <em>Kercheval v. United States</em>, 274 U.S. 220, 223 (1927); <em>Munich v. United States</em>, 337 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1964); <em>Pilkington v. United States</em>, 315 F.2d 204 (4th Cir. 1963); <em>Smith v. United States</em>, 324 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1963); but cf. <em>Marvel v. United States</em>, 335 F.2d 101 (5th Cir. 1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">A new sentence is added at the end of the rule to impose a duty on the court in cases where the defendant pleads guilty to satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for the plea before entering judgment. The court should satisfy itself, by inquiry of the defendant or the attorney for the government, or by examining the presentence report, or otherwise, that the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged in the indictment or information or an offense included therein to which the defendant has pleaded guilty. Such inquiry should, e.g., protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge. For a similar requirement see Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;28.1058 (1954); Mich. Sup. Ct. Rule 35A; <em>In re Valle</em>, 364 Mich. 471, 110 N.W.2d 673 (1961); <em>People v. Barrows</em>, 358 Mich. 267, 99 N.W.2d 347 (1959); <em>People v. Bumpus</em>, 355 Mich. 374, 94 N.W.2d 854 (1959); <em>People v. Coates</em>, 337 Mich. 56, 59 N.W.2d 83 (1953). See also <em>Stinson v. United States</em>, 316 F.2d 554 (5th Cir. 1963). The normal consequence of a determination that there is not a factual basis for the plea would be for the court to set aside the plea and enter a plea of not guilty.</p>
<p class="note-body">For a variety of reasons it is desirable in some cases to permit entry of judgment upon a plea of nolo contendere without inquiry into the factual basis for the plea. The new third sentence is not, therefore, made applicable to pleas of nolo contendere. It is not intended by this omission to reflect any view upon the effect of a plea of nolo contendere in relation to a plea of guilty. That problem has been dealt with by the courts. See e.g., <em>Lott v. United States</em>, 367 U.S. 421, 426 (1961).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to rule 11 are designed to achieve two principal objectives:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Subdivision (c) prescribes the advice which the court must give to insure that the defendant who pleads guilty has made an informed plea.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Subdivision (e) provides a plea agreement procedure designed to give recognition to the propriety of plea discussions; to bring the existence of a plea agreement out into the open in court; and to provide methods for court acceptance or rejection of a plea agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Other less basic changes are also made. The changes are discussed in the order in which they appear in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) retains the requirement that the defendant obtain the consent of the court in order to plead nolo contendere. It adds that the court shall, in deciding whether to accept the plea, consider the views of the prosecution and of the defense and also the larger public interest in the administration of criminal justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the plea of nolo contendere has long existed in the federal courts, <em>Hudson v. United States</em>, 272 U.S. 451, 47 S.Ct. 127, 71 L.Ed. 347 (1926), the desirability of the plea has been a subject of disagreement. Compare Lane-Reticker, Nolo Contendere in North Carolina, 34 N.C.L.Rev. 280, 290&ndash;291 (1956), with Note. The Nature and Consequences of the Plea of Nolo Contendere, 33 Neb.L.Rev. 428, 434 (1954), favoring the plea. The American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice takes the position that &ldquo;the case for the nolo plea is not strong enough to justify a minimum standard supporting its use,&rdquo; but because &ldquo;use of the plea contributes in some degree to the avoidance of unnecessary trials&rdquo; it does not proscribe use of the plea. ABA, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.1(a) Commentary at 16 (Approved Draft, 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">A plea of nolo contendere is, for purposes of punishment, the same as the plea of guilty. See discussion of the history of the nolo plea in <em>North Carolina v. Alford</em>, 400 U.S. 25, 35&ndash;36 n. 8, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). Note, The Nature and Consequences of the Plea of Nolo Contendere, 33 Neb.L.Rev. 428, 430 (1954). A judgment upon the plea is a conviction and may be used to apply multiple offender statutes. Lenvin and Meyers, Nolo Contendere: Its Nature and Implications, 51 Yale L.J. 1255, 1265 (1942). Unlike a plea of guilty, however, it cannot be used against a defendant as an admission in a subsequent criminal or civil case. 4 Wigmore &sect;1066(4), at 58 (3d ed. 1940, Supp. 1970); Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates, rule 803(22) (Nov. 1971). See Lenvin and Meyers, Nolo Contendere: Its Nature and Implications, 51 Yale L.J. 1255 (1942); ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;&sect;1.1(a) and (b), Commentary at 15&ndash;18 (Approved Draft, 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">The factors considered relevant by particular courts in determining whether to permit the plea of nolo contendere vary. Compare <em>United States v. Bagliore</em>, 182 F.Supp. 714, 716 (E.D.N.Y. 1960), where the view is taken that the plea should be rejected unless a compelling reason for acceptance is established, with <em>United States v. Jones</em>, 119 F.Supp. 288, 290 (S.D.Cal. 1954), where the view is taken that the plea should be accepted in the absence of a compelling reason to the contrary.</p>
<p class="note-body">A defendant who desires to plead nolo contendere will commonly want to avoid pleading guilty because the plea of guilty can be introduced as an admission in subsequent civil litigation. The prosecution may oppose the plea of nolo contendere because it wants a definite resolution of the defendant's guilty or innocence either for correctional purposes or for reasons of subsequent litigation. ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.1(b) Commentary at 16&ndash;18 (Approved Draft, 1968). Under subdivision (b) of the new rule the balancing of the interests is left to the trial judge, who is mandated to take into account the larger public interest in the effective administration of justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) prescribes the advice which the court must give to the defendant as a prerequisite to the acceptance of a plea of guilty. The former rule required that the court determine that the plea was made with &ldquo;understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.&rdquo; The amendment identifies more specifically what must be explained to the defendant and also codifies, in the rule, the requirements of <em>Boykin v. Alabama</em>, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), which held that a defendant must be apprised of the fact that he relinquishes certain constitutional rights by pleading guilty.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:41 --><p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) retains the requirement that the court address the defendant personally. See <em>McCarthy v. United States</em>, 394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). There is also an amendment to rule 43 to make clear that a defendant must be in court at the time of the plea.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(1) retains the current requirement that the court determine that the defendant understands the nature of the charge. This is a common requirement. See ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.4(a) (Approved Draft, 1968); Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(a)(1) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(a)(1). The method by which the defendant's understanding of the nature of the charge is determined may vary from case to case, depending on the complexity of the circumstances and the particular defendant. In some cases, a judge may do this by reading the indictment and by explaining the elements of the offense to the defendants. Thompson, The Judge's Responsibility on a Plea of Guilty 62 W.Va.L.Rev. 213, 220 (1960); Resolution of Judges of U.S. District Court for D.C., June 24, 1959.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former rule 11 required the court to inform the defendant of the &ldquo;consequences of the plea.&rdquo; Subdivision (c)(2) changes this and requires instead that the court inform the defendant of and determine that he understands &ldquo;the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law for the offense to which the plea is offered.&rdquo; The objective is to insure that a defendant knows what minimum sentence the judge must impose and what maximum sentence the judge may impose. This information is usually readily ascertainable from the face of the statute defining the crime, and thus it is feasible for the judge to know specifically what to tell the defendant. Giving this advice tells a defendant the shortest mandatory sentence and also the longest possible sentence for the offense to which he is pleading guilty.</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been suggested that it is desirable to inform a defendant of additional consequences which might follow from his plea of guilty. <em>Durant v. United States</em>, 410 F.2d 689 (1st Cir. 1969), held that a defendant must be informed of his ineligibility for parole. <em>Trujillo v. United States</em>, 377 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1967), cert. denied 389 U.S. 899, 88 S.Ct. 224, 19 L.Ed.2d 221 (1967), held that advice about eligibility for parole is not required. It has been suggested that a defendant be advised that a jury might find him guilty only of a lesser included offense. C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;173 at 374 (1969). See contra <em>Dorrough v. United States</em>, 385 F.2d 887 (5th Cir. 1967). The ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.4(c)(iii) (Approved Draft, 1968) recommend that the defendant be informed that he may be subject to additional punishment if the offense charged is one for which a different or additional punishment is authorized by reason of the defendant's previous conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the rule the judge is not required to inform a defendant about these matters, though a judge is free to do so if he feels a consequence of a plea of guilty in a particular case is likely to be of real significance to the defendant. Currently, certain consequences of a plea of guilty, such as parole eligibility, may be so complicated that it is not feasible to expect a judge to clearly advise the defendant. For example, the judge may impose a sentence under 18 U.S.C. &sect;4202 making the defendant eligible for parole when he has served one third of the judicially imposed maximum; or, under 18 U.S.C. &sect;4208(a)(1), making parole eligibility after a specified period of time less than one third of the maximum; or, under 18 U.S.C. &sect;4208(a)(2), leaving eligibility to the discretion of the parole board. At the time the judge is required to advise the defendant of the consequences of his plea, the judge will usually not have seen the presentence report and thus will have no basis for giving a defendant any very realistic advice as to when he might be eligible for parole. Similar complications exist with regard to other, particularly collateral, consequences of a plea of guilty in a given case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivisions (c)(3) and (4) specify the constitutional rights that the defendant waives by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. These subdivisions are designed to satisfy the requirements of understanding waiver set forth in <em>Boykin v. Alabama</em>, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). Subdivision (c)(3) is intended to require that the judge inform the defendant and determine that he understands that he waives his fifth amendment rights. The rule takes the position that the defendant's right not to incriminate himself is best explained in terms of his right to plead not guilty and to persist in that plea if it has already been made. This is language identical to that adopted in Illinois for the same purpose. See Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(a)(3) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(a)(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(4) assumes that a defendant's right to have his guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to confront his accusers are best explained by indicating that the right to trial is waived. Specifying that there will be no future trial of any kind makes this fact clear to those defendants who, though knowing they have waived trial by jury, are under the mistaken impression that some kind of trial will follow. Illinois has recently adopted similar language. Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(a)(4) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(a)(4). In explaining to a defendant that he waives his right to trial, the judge may want to explain some of the aspects of trial such as the right to confront witnesses, to subpoena witnesses, to testify in his own behalf, or, if he chooses, not to testify. What is required, in this respect, to conform to <em>Boykin</em> is left to future case-law development.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) retains the requirement that the court determine that a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is voluntary before accepting it. It adds the requirement that the court also inquire whether the defendant's willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior plea discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or his attorney. See <em>Santobello v. New York</em>, 404 U.S. 257, 261&ndash;262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971): &ldquo;The plea must, of course, be voluntary and knowing and if it was induced by promises, the essence of those promises must in some way be made known.&rdquo; Subdivisions (d) and (e) afford the court adequate basis for rejecting an improper plea agreement induced by threats or inappropriate promises.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new rule specifies that the court personally address the defendant in determining the voluntariness of the plea.</p>
<p class="note-body">By personally interrogating the defendant, not only will the judge be better able to ascertain the plea's voluntariness, but he will also develop a more complete record to support his determination in a subsequent post-conviction attack. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Both of these goals are undermined in proportion to the degree the district judge resorts to &ldquo;assumptions&rdquo; not based upon recorded responses to his inquiries. <em>McCarthy v. United States</em>, 394 U.S. 459, 466, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) provides a plea agreement procedure. In doing so it gives recognition to the propriety of plea discussions and plea agreements provided that they are disclosed in open court and subject to acceptance or rejection by the trial judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although reliable statistical information is limited, one recent estimate indicated that guilty pleas account for the disposition of as many as 95% of all criminal cases. ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty, pp. 1&ndash;2 (Approved Draft, 1968). A substantial number of these are the result of plea discussions. The President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Courts 9 (1967); D. Newman, Conviction: The Determination of Guilt or Innocence Without Trial 3 (1966); L. Weinreb, Criminal Process 437 (1969); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises by Prosecutors To Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 865 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">There is increasing acknowledgement of both the inevitability and the propriety of plea agreements. See, <!-- PDFPage:42 -->e.g., ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.1 (Approved Draft, 1968); Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402 (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Brady v. United States</em>, 397 U.S. 742, 752&ndash;753, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body">Of course, that the prevalence of guilty pleas is explainable does not necessarily validate those pleas or the system which produces them. But we cannot hold that it is unconstitutional for the State to extend a benefit to a defendant who in turn extends a substantial benefit to the State and who demonstrates by his plea that he is ready and willing to admit his crime and to enter the correctional system in a frame of mind that affords hope for success in rehabilitation over a shorter period of time than might otherwise be necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Santobello v. New York</em>, 404 U.S. 257, 260, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body">The disposition of criminal charges by agreement between the prosecutor and the accused, sometimes loosely called &ldquo;plea bargaining,&rdquo; is an essential component of the administration of justice. Properly administered, it is to be encouraged.</p>
<p class="note-body">Administratively, the criminal justice system has come to depend upon pleas of guilty and, hence, upon plea discussions. See, e.g., President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report. The Courts 9 (1967); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises By Prosecutors To Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 865 (1964). But expediency is not the basis for recognizing the propriety of a plea agreement practice. Properly implemented, a plea agreement procedure is consistent with both effective and just administration of the criminal law. <em>Santobello v. New York</em>, 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427. This is the conclusion reached in the ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.8 (Approved Draft, 1968); the ABA Standards Relating to The Prosecution Function and The Defense Function pp. 243&ndash;253 (Approved Draft, 1971); and the ABA Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge, &sect;4.1 (App.Draft, 1972). The Supreme Court of California recently recognized the propriety of plea bargaining. See <em>People v. West</em>, 3 Cal.3d 595, 91 Cal.Rptr. 385, 477 P.2d 409 (1970). A plea agreement procedure has recently been decided in the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions upon the recommendation of the United States Attorney. See 51 F.R.D. 109 (1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Where the defendant by his plea aids in insuring prompt and certain application of correctional measures, the proper ends of the criminal justice system are furthered because swift and certain punishment serves the ends of both general deterrence and the rehabilitation of the individual defendant. Cf. Note, The Influence of the Defendant's Plea on Judicial Determination of Sentence, 66 Yale L.J. 204, 211 (1956). Where the defendant has acknowledged his guilt and shown a willingness to assume responsibility for his conduct, it has been thought proper to recognize this in sentencing. See also ALI, Model Penal Code &sect;7.01 (P.O.D. 1962); NPPA Guides for Sentencing (1957). Granting a charge reduction in return for a plea of guilty may give the sentencing judge needed discretion, particularly where the facts of a case do not warrant the harsh consequences of a long mandatory sentence or collateral consequences which are unduly severe. A plea of guilty avoids the necessity of a public trial and may protect the innocent victim of a crime against the trauma of direct and cross-examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, a plea agreement may also contribute to the successful prosecution of other more serious offenders. See D. Newman, Conviction: The Determination of Guilt or Innocence Without Trial, chs. 2 and 3 (1966); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises By Prosecutors To Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 865, 881 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">Where plea discussions and agreements are viewed as proper, it is generally agreed that it is preferable that the fact of the plea agreement be disclosed in open court and its propriety be reviewed by the trial judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">We have previously recognized plea bargaining as an ineradicable fact. Failure to recognize it tends not to destroy it but to drive it underground. We reiterate what we have said before: that when plea bargaining occurs it ought to be spread on the record [The Bench Book prepared by the Federal Judicial Center for use by United States District Judges now suggests that the defendant be asked by the court &ldquo;if he believes there is any understanding or if any predictions have been made to him concerning the sentence he will receive.&rdquo; Bench Book for United States District Judges, Federal Judicial Center (1969) at 1.05.3.] and publicly disclosed. <em>United States v. Williams</em>, 407 F.2d 940 (4th Cir. 1969). *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In the future we think that the district judges should not only make the general inquiry under Rule 11 as to whether the plea of guilty has been coerced or induced by promises, but should specifically inquire of counsel whether plea bargaining has occurred. Logically the general inquiry should elicit information about plea bargaining, but it seldom has in the past. <em>Raines v. United States</em>, 423 F.2d 526, 530 (4th Cir. 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">In the past, plea discussions and agreements have occurred in an informal and largely invisible manner. Enker, Perspectives on Plea Bargaining, in President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Courts 108, 115 (1967). There has often been a ritual of denial that any promises have been made, a ritual in which judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel have participated. ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.1, Commentary at 60&ndash;69 (Approved Draft 1968); Task Force Report: The Courts 9. Consequently, there has been a lack of effective judicial review of the propriety of the agreements, thus increasing the risk of real or apparent unfairness. See ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.1, Commentary at 60 et seq.; Task Force Report: The Courts 9&ndash;13.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedure described in subdivision (e) is designed to prevent abuse of plea discussions and agreements by providing appropriate and adequate safeguards.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(1) specifies that the &ldquo;attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se may&rdquo; participate in plea discussions. The inclusion of &ldquo;the defendant when acting pro se&rdquo; is intended to reflect the fact that there are situations in which a defendant insists upon representing himself. It may be desirable that an attorney for the government not enter plea discussions with a defendant personally. If necessary, counsel can be appointed for purposes of plea discussions. (Subdivision (d) makes it mandatory that the court inquire of the defendant whether his plea is the result of plea discussions between him and the attorney for the government. This is intended to enable the court to reject an agreement reached by an unrepresented defendant unless the court is satisfied that acceptance of the agreement adequately protects the rights of the defendant and the interests of justice.) This is substantially the position of the ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.1(a), Commentary at 65&ndash;66 (Approved Draft, 1968). Apparently, it is the practice of most prosecuting attorneys to enter plea discussions only with defendant's counsel. Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises By Prosecutors To Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 865, 904 (1964). Discussions without benefit of counsel increase the likelihood that such discussions may be unfair. Some courts have indicated that plea discussions in the absence of defendant's attorney may be constitutionally prohibited. See <em>Anderson v. North Carolina</em>, 221 F.Supp. 930, 935 (W.D.N.C.1963); <em>Shape v. Sigler</em>, 230 F.Supp. 601, 606 (D.Neb. 1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(1) is intended to make clear that there are four possible concessions that may be made in a plea agreement. First, the charge may be reduced to a lesser or related offense. Second, the attorney for the government may promise to move for dismissal of other charges. Third, the attorney for the government may agree to recommend or not oppose the imposition of a particular sentence. Fourth, the attorneys for the government and the defense may agree that a given <!-- PDFPage:43 -->sentence is an appropriate disposition of the case. This is made explicit in subdivision (e)(2) where reference is made to an agreement made &ldquo;in the expectation that a specific sentence will be imposed.&rdquo; See Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises By Prosecutors To Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 865, 898 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(1) prohibits the court from participating in plea discussions. This is the position of the ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.3(a) (Approved Draft, 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been stated that it is common practice for a judge to participate in plea discussions. See D. Newman, Conviction: The Determination of Guilt or Innocence Without Trial 32&ndash;52, 78&ndash;104 (1966); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises By Prosecutors To Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 865, 891, 905 (1964).</p>
<p class="note-body">There are valid reasons for a judge to avoid involvement in plea discussions. It might lead the defendant to believe that he would not receive a fair trial, were there a trial before the same judge. The risk of not going along with the disposition apparently desired by the judge might induce the defendant to plead guilty, even if innocent. Such involvement makes it difficult for a judge to objectively assess the voluntariness of the plea. See ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.3(a), Commentary at 72&ndash;74 (Approved Draft, 1968); Note, Guilty Plea Bargaining: Compromises By Prosecutors To Secure Guilty Pleas, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 865, 891&ndash;892 (1964); Comment, Official Inducements to Plead Guilty: Suggested Morals for a Marketplace, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. 167, 180&ndash;183 (1964); Informal Opinion No. 779 ABA Professional Ethics Committee (&ldquo;A judge should not be a party to advance arrangements for the determination of sentence, whether as a result of a guilty plea or a finding of guilt based on proof.&rdquo;), 51 A.B.A.J. 444 (1965). As has been recently pointed out:</p>
<p class="note-body">The unequal positions of the judge and the accused, one with the power to commit to prison and the other deeply concerned to avoid prison, as once raise a question of fundamental fairness. When a judge becomes a participant in plea bargaining he brings to bear the full force and majesty of his office. His awesome power to impose a substantially longer or even maximum sentence in excess of that proposed is present whether referred to or not. A defendant needs no reminder that if he rejects the proposal, stands upon his right to trial and is convicted, he faces a significantly longer sentence. <em>United States ex rel. Elksnis v. Gilligan</em>, 256 F.Supp. 244, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 1966).</p>
<p class="note-body">On the other hand, one commentator has taken the position that the judge may be involved in discussions either after the agreement is reached or to help elicit facts and an agreement. Enker, Perspectives on Plea Bargaining, in President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Courts 108, 117&ndash;118 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment makes clear that the judge should not participate in plea discussions leading to a plea agreement. It is contemplated that the judge may participate in such discussions as may occur when the plea agreement is disclosed in open court. This is the position of the recently adopted Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(d)(1) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(d)(1). As to what may constitute &ldquo;participation,&rdquo; contrast <em>People v. Earegood</em>, 12 Mich.App. 256, 268&ndash;269, 162 N.W.2d 802, 809&ndash;810 (1968), with <em>Kruse v. State</em>, 47 Wis.2d 460, 177 N.W.2d 322 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(2) provides that the judge shall require the disclosure of any plea agreement in open court. In <em>People v. West</em>, 3 Cal.3d 595, 91 Cal.Rptr. 385, 477 P.2d 409 (1970), the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body">[T]he basis of the bargain should be disclosed to the court and incorporated in the record. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body">Without limiting that court to those we set forth, we note four possible methods of incorporation: (1) the bargain could be stated orally and recorded by the court reporter, whose notes then must be preserved or transcribed; (2) the bargain could be set forth by the clerk in the minutes of the court; (3) the parties could file a written stipulation stating the terms of the bargain; (4) finally, counsel or the court itself may find it useful to prepare and utilize forms for the recordation of plea bargains. 91 Cal.Rptr. 393, 394, 477 P.2d at 417, 418.</p>
<p class="note-body">The District of Columbia Court of General Sessions is using a &ldquo;Sentence-Recommendation Agreement&rdquo; form.</p>
<p class="note-body">Upon notice of the plea agreement, the court is given the option to accept or reject the agreement or defer its decision until receipt of the presentence report.</p>
<p class="note-body">The judge may, and often should, defer his decision until he examines the presentence report. This is made possible by rule 32 which allows a judge, with the defendant's consent, to inspect a presentence report to determine whether a plea agreement should be accepted. For a discussion of the use of conditional plea acceptance, see ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.3(b), Commentary at 74&ndash;76, and Supplement, Proposed Revisions &sect;3.3(b) at 2&ndash;3 (Approved Draft, 1968); Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(d)(2) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The plea agreement procedure does not attempt to define criteria for the acceptance or rejection of a plea agreement. Such a decision is left to the discretion of the individual trial judge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(3) makes is mandatory, if the court decides to accept the plea agreement, that it inform the defendant that it will embody in the judgment and sentence the disposition provided in the plea agreement, or one more favorable to the defendant. This serves the purpose of informing the defendant immediately that the agreement will be implemented.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(4) requires the court, if it rejects the plea agreement, to inform the defendant of this fact and to advise the defendant personally, in open court, that the court is not bound by the plea agreement. The defendant must be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his plea and must be advised that if he persists in his guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere, the disposition of the case may be less favorable to him than that contemplated by the plea agreement. That the defendant should have the opportunity to withdraw his plea if the court rejects the plea agreement is the position taken in ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty, Supplement, Proposed Revisions &sect;2.1(a)(ii)(5) (Approved Draft, 1968). Such a rule has been adopted in Illinois. Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(d)(2) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">If the court rejects the plea agreement and affords the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea, the court is not precluded from accepting a guilty plea from the same defendant at a later time, when such plea conforms to the requirements of rule 11.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(5) makes it mandatory that, except for good cause shown, the court be notified of the existence of a plea agreement at the arraignment or at another time prior to trial fixed by the court. Having a plea entered at this stage provides a reasonable time for the defendant to consult with counsel and for counsel to complete any plea discussions with the attorney for the government. ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.3 (Approved Draft, 1968). The objective of the provision is to make clear that the court has authority to require a plea agreement to be disclosed sufficiently in advance of trial so as not to interfere with the efficient scheduling of criminal cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(6) is taken from rule 410, Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates (Nov. 1971). See Advisory Committee Note thereto. See also the ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;2.2 (Approved Draft, 1968); Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(f) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(f).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f) retains the requirement of old rule 11 that the court should not enter judgment upon a plea of guilty without making such an inquiry as will satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea. The draft does not specify that any particular type of inquiry be made. See <em>Santobello v. New York</em>, 404 U.S. 257, 261, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); &ldquo;Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11, governing pleas in federal courts, now makes clear that the sentencing judge must develop, on the record, the factual basis for the plea, as, for exam<!-- PDFPage:44 -->ple, by having the accused describe the conduct that gave rise to the charge.&rdquo; An inquiry might be made of the defendant, of the attorneys for the government and the defense, of the presentence report when one is available, or by whatever means is appropriate in a specific case. This is the position of the ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.6 (Approved Draft, 1968). Where inquiry is made of the defendant himself it may be desirable practice to place the defendant under oath. With regard to a determination that there is a factual basis for a plea of guilty to a &ldquo;lessor or related offense,&rdquo; compare ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.1(b)(ii), Commentary at 67&ndash;68 (Approved Draft, 1968), with ALI, Model Penal Code &sect;1.07(5) (P.O.D. 1962). The rule does not speak directly to the issue of whether a judge may accept a plea of guilty where there is a factual basis for the plea but the defendant asserts his innocence. <em>North Carolina v. Alford</em>, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). The procedure in such case would seem to be to deal with this as a plea of nolo contendere, the acceptance of which would depend upon the judge's decision as to whether acceptance of the plea is consistent with &ldquo;the interest of the public in the effective administration of justice&rdquo; [new rule 11(b)]. The defendant who asserts his innocence while pleading guilty or nolo contendere is often difficult to deal with in a correctional setting, and it may therefore be preferable to resolve the issue of guilt or innocence at the trial stage rather than leaving that issue unresolved, thus complicating subsequent correctional decisions. The rule is intended to make clear that a judge may reject a plea of nolo contendere and require the defendant either to plead not guilty or to plead guilty under circumstances in which the judge is able to determine that the defendant is in fact guilty of the crime to which he is pleading guilty.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g) requires that a verbatim record be kept of the proceedings. If there is a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the record must include, without limitation, the court's advice to the defendant, the inquiry into the voluntariness of the plea and the plea agreement, and the inquiry into the accuracy of the plea. Such a record is important in the event of a postconviction attack. ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.7 (Approved Draft, 1968). A similar requirement was adopted in Illinois: Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402(e) (1970), Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, &sect;402(e).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with pleas. The Supreme Court has proposed to amend this rule extensively.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 11 provides that a defendant may plead guilty, not guilty, or nolo contendere. The Supreme Court's amendments to Rule 11(b) provide that a nolo contendere plea &ldquo;shall be accepted by the court only after due consideration of the views of the parties and the interest of the public in the effective administration of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11(c) spell out the advise that the court must give to the defendant before accepting the defendant's plea of guilty or nolo contendere. The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11(d) set forth the steps that the court must take to insure that a guilty or nolo contendere plea has been voluntarily made.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11(e) establish a plea agreement procedure. This procedure permits the parties to discuss disposing of a case without a trial and sets forth the type of agreements that the parties can reach concerning the disposition of the case. The procedure is not mandatory; a court is free not to permit the parties to present plea agreements to it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11(f) require that the court, before entering judgment upon a plea of guilty, satisfy itself that &ldquo;there is a factual basis for the plea.&rdquo; The Supreme Court amendments to Rule 11(g) require that a verbatim record be kept of the proceedings at which the defendant enters a plea.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The proposed amendments to Rule 11, particularly those relating to the plea negotiating procedure, have generated much comment and criticism. No observer is entirely happy that our criminal justice system must rely to the extent it does on negotiated dispositions of cases. However, crowded court dockets make plea negotiating a fact that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should contend with. The Committee accepts the basic structure and provisions of Rule 11(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 11(e) as proposed permits each federal court to decide for itself the extent to which it will permit plea negotiations to be carried on within its own jurisdiction. No court is compelled to permit any plea negotiations at all. Proposed Rule 11(e) regulates plea negotiations and agreements if, and to the extent that, the court permits such negotiations and agreements. [Proposed Rule 11(e) has been criticized by some federal judges who read it to mandate the court to permit plea negotiations and the reaching of plea agreements. The Advisory Committee stressed during its testimony that the rule does not mandate that a court permit any form of plea agreement to be presented to it. See, e.g., the remarks of United States Circuit Judge William H. Webster in Hearings II, at 196. See also the exchange of correspondence between Judge Webster and United States District Judge Frank A. Kaufman in Hearings II, at 289&ndash;90.]</p>
<p class="note-body">Proposed Rule 11(e) contemplates 4 different types of plea agreements. First, the defendant can plead guilty or nolo contendere in return for the prosecutor's reducing the charge to a less serious offense. Second, the defendant can plead guilty or nolo contendere in return for the prosecutor dropping, or not bringing, a charge or charges relating to other offenses. Third, the defendant can plead guilty or nolo contendere in return for the prosecutor's recommending a sentence. Fourth, the defendant and prosecutor can agree that a particular sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case. [It is apparent, though not explicitly stated, that Rule 11(e) contemplates that the plea agreement may bind the defendant to do more than just plead guilty or nolo contendere. For example, the plea agreement may bind the defendant to cooperate with the prosecution in a different investigation. The Committee intends by its approval of Rule 11(e) to permit the parties to agree on such terms in a plea agreement.]</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added language in subdivisions (e)(2) and (e)(4) to permit a plea agreement to be disclosed to the court, or rejected by it, in camera. There must be a showing of good cause before the court can conduct such proceedings in camera. The language does not address itself to whether the showing of good cause may be made in open court or in camera. That issue is left for the courts to resolve on a case-by-case basis. These changes in subdivisions (e)(2) and (e)(4) will permit a fair trial when there is substantial media interest in a case and the court is rejecting a plea agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added an exception to subdivision (e)(6). That subdivision provides:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">Evidence of a plea of guilty, later withdrawn, or a plea of nolo contendere, or of an offer to plead guilty or nolo contendere to the crime charged or any other crime, or of statements made in connection with any of the foregoing pleas or offers, is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who made the plea or offer.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee's exception permits the use of such evidence in a perjury or false statement prosecution where the plea, offer, or related statement was made by the defendant on the record, under oath and in the presence of counsel. The Committee recognizes that even this limited exception may discourage defendants from being completely candid and open during plea negotiations and may even result in discouraging the reaching of plea agreements. However, the Committee believes hat, on balance, it is more important to protect the integrity of the judicial process from willful <!-- PDFPage:45 -->deceit and untruthfulness. [The Committee does not intend its language to be construed as mandating or encouraging the swearing-in of the defendant during proceedings in connection with the disclosure and acceptance or rejection of a plea agreement.]</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee recast the language of Rule 11(c), which deals with the advice given to a defendant before the court can accept his plea of guilty or nolo contendere. The Committee acted in part because it believed that the warnings given to the defendant ought to include those that <em>Boykin v. Alabama</em>, 395 U.S. 238 (1969), said were constitutionally required. In addition, and as a result of its change in subdivision (e)(6), the Committee thought if only fair that the defendant be warned that his plea of guilty (later withdrawn) or nolo contendere, or his offer of either plea, or his statements made in connection with such pleas or offers, could later be used against him in a perjury trial if made under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 94&ndash;414; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (c). Rule 11(c) enumerates certain things that a judge must tell a defendant before the judge can accept that defendant's plea of guilty or nolo contendere. The House version expands upon the list originally proposed by the Supreme Court. The Senate version adopts the Supreme Court's proposal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the House provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (e)(1). Rule 11(e)(1) outlines some general considerations concerning the plea agreement procedure. The Senate version makes nonsubstantive change in the House version.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">Note to subdivision (e)(6). Rule 11(e)(6) deals with the use of statements made in connection with plea agreements. The House version permits a limited use of pleas of guilty, later withdrawn, or nolo contendere, offers of such pleas, and statements made in connection with such pleas or offers. Such evidence can be used in a perjury or false statement prosecution if the plea, offer, or related statement was made under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel. The Senate version permits evidence of voluntary and reliable statements made in court on the record to be used for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of the declarant or in a perjury or false statement prosecution.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the House version with changes. The Conference agrees that neither a plea nor the offer of a plea ought to be admissible for any purpose. The Conference-adopted provision, therefore, like the Senate provision, permits only the use of statements made in connection with a plea of guilty, later withdrawn, or a plea of nolo contendere, or in connection with an offer of a guilty or nolo contendere plea.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(2). The amendment to rule 11(e)(2) is intended to clarify the circumstances in which the court may accept or reject a plea agreement, with the consequences specified in subdivision (e)(3) and (4). The present language has been the cause of some confusion and has led to results which are not entirely consistent. Compare <em>United States v. Sarubbi</em>, 416 F.Supp. 633 (D. N.J. 1976); with <em>United States v. Hull</em>, 413 F.Supp. 145 (E.D. Tenn. 1976).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 11(e)(1) specifies three types of plea agreements, namely, those in which the attorney for the government might</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) move for dismissal of other charges; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) make a recommendation, or agree not to oppose the defendant's request, for a particular sentence, with the understanding that such recommendation or request shall not be binding upon the court; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">A (B) type of plea agreement is clearly of a different order than the other two, for an agreement to recommend or not to oppose is discharged when the prosecutor performs as he agreed to do. By comparison, critical to a type (A) or (C) agreement is that the defendant receive the contemplated charge dismissal or agreed-to sentence. Consequently, there must ultimately be an acceptance or rejection by the court of a type (A) or (C) agreement so that it may be determined whether the defendant shall receive the bargained-for concessions or shall instead be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his plea. But this is not so as to a type (B) agreement; there is no &ldquo;disposition provided for&rdquo; in such a plea agreement so as to make the acceptance provisions of subdivision (e)(3) applicable, nor is there a need for rejection with opportunity for withdrawal under subdivision (e)(4) in light of the fact that the defendant knew the nonbinding character of the recommendation or request. <em>United States v. Henderson</em>, 565 F.2d 1119 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Savage</em>, 561 F.2d 554 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because a type (B) agreement is distinguishable from the others in that it involves only a recommendation or request not binding upon the court, it is important that the defendant be aware that this is the nature of the agreement into which he has entered. The procedure contemplated by the last sentence of amended subdivision (e)(2) will establish for the record that there is such awareness. This provision conforms to ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.5 (Approved Draft, 1968), which provides that &ldquo;the court must advise the defendant personally that the recommendations of the prosecuting attorney are not binding on the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Sometimes a plea agreement will be partially but not entirely of the (B) type, as where a defendant, charged with counts 1, 2 and 3, enters into an agreement with the attorney for the government wherein it is agreed that if defendant pleads guilty to count 1, the prosecutor will recommend a certain sentence as to that count and will move for dismissal of counts 2 and 3. In such a case, the court must take particular care to ensure that the defendant understands which components of the agreement involve only a (B) type recommendation and which do not. In the above illustration, that part of the agreement which contemplates the dismissal of counts 2 and 3 is an (A) type agreement, and thus under rule 11(e) the court must either accept the agreement to dismiss these counts or else reject it and allow the defendant to withdraw his plea. If rejected, the defendant must be allowed to withdraw the plea on count 1 even if the type (B) promise to recommend a certain sentence on that count is kept, for a multi-faceted plea agreement is nonetheless a single agreement. On the other hand, if counts 2 and 3 are dismissed and the sentence recommendation is made, then the defendant is not entitled to withdraw his plea even if the sentence recommendation is not accepted by the court, for the defendant received all he was entitled to under the various components of the plea agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(6). The major objective of the amendment to rule 11(e)(6) is to describe more precisely, consistent with the original purpose of the provision, what evidence relating to pleas or plea discussions is inadmissible. The present language is susceptible to interpretation which would make it applicable to a wide variety of statements made under various circumstances other than within the context of those plea discussions authorized by rule 11(e) and intended to be protected by subdivision (e)(6) of the rule. See <em>United States v. Herman</em>, 544 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1977), discussed herein.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fed.R.Ev. 410, as originally adopted by Pub. L. 93&ndash;595, provided in part that &ldquo;evidence of a plea of guilty, later withdrawn, or a plea of nolo contendere, or of an offer to plead guilty or nolo contendere to the crime charged or any other crime, or of statements made in connection with any of the foregoing pleas or offers, is not admissible in any civil or criminal action, case, or proceeding against the person who made the plea or offer.&rdquo; (This rule was adopted with the proviso that it &ldquo;shall be superseded by any amendment to the Federal Rules <!-- PDFPage:46 -->of Criminal Procedure which is inconsistent with this rule.&rdquo;) As the Advisory Committee Note explained: &ldquo;Exclusion of offers to plead guilty or nolo has as its purpose the promotion of disposition of criminal cases by compromise.&rdquo; The amendment of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, transmitted to Congress by the Supreme Court in April 1974, contained a subdivision (e)(6) essentially identical to the rule 410 language quoted above, as a part of a substantial revision of rule 11. The most significant feature of this revision was the express recognition given to the fact that the &ldquo;attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se may engage in discussions with a view toward reaching&rdquo; a plea agreement. Subdivision (e)(6) was intended to encourage such discussions. As noted in H.R.Rep. No. 94&ndash;247, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1975), the purpose of subdivision (e)(6) is to not &ldquo;discourage defendants from being completely candid and open during plea negotiations.&rdquo; Similarly, H.R.Rep. No. 94&ndash;414, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1975), states that &ldquo;Rule 11(e)(6) deals with the use of statements made in connection with plea agreements.&rdquo; (Rule 11(e)(6) was thereafter enacted, with the addition of the proviso allowing use of statements in a prosecution for perjury, and with the qualification that the inadmissible statements must also be &ldquo;relevant to&rdquo; the inadmissible pleas or offers. Pub. L. 94&ndash;64; Fed.R.Ev. 410 was then amended to conform. Pub. L. 94&ndash;149.)</p>
<p class="note-body">While this history shows that the purpose of Fed.R.Ev. 410 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(6) is to permit the unrestrained candor which produces effective plea discussions between the &ldquo;attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se,&rdquo; given visibility and sanction in rule 11(e), a literal reading of the language of these two rules could reasonably lead to the conclusion that a broader rule of inadmissibility obtains. That is, because &ldquo;statements&rdquo; are generally inadmissible if &ldquo;made in connection with, and relevant to&rdquo; an &ldquo;offer to plead guilty,&rdquo; it might be thought that an otherwise voluntary admission to law enforcement officials is rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in the hope of obtaining leniency by a plea. Some decisions interpreting rule 11(e)(6) point in this direction. See <em>United States v. Herman</em>, 544 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1977) (defendant in custody of two postal inspectors during continuance of removal hearing instigated conversation with them and at some point said he would plead guilty to armed robbery if the murder charge was dropped; one inspector stated they were not &ldquo;in position&rdquo; to make any deals in this regard; held, defendant's statement inadmissible under rule 11(e)(6) because the defendant &ldquo;made the statements during the course of a conversation in which he sought concessions from the government in return for a guilty plea&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Brooks</em>, 536 F.2d 1137 (6th Cir. 1976) (defendant telephoned postal inspector and offered to plead guilty if he got 2-year maximum; statement inadmissible).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment makes inadmissible statements made &ldquo;in the course of any proceedings under this rule regarding&rdquo; either a plea of guilty later withdrawn or a plea of nolo contendere, and also statements &ldquo;made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the government which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.&rdquo; It is not limited to statements by the defendant himself, and thus would cover statements by defense counsel regarding defendant's incriminating admissions to him. It thus fully protects the plea discussion process authorized by rule 11 without attempting to deal with confrontations between suspects and law enforcement agents, which involve problems of quite different dimensions. See, e.g., ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, art. 140 and &sect;150.2(8) (Proposed Official Draft, 1975) (latter section requires exclusion if &ldquo;a law enforcement officer induces any person to make a statement by promising leniency&rdquo;). This change, it must be emphasized, does not compel the conclusion that statements made to law enforcement agents, especially when the agents purport to have authority to bargain, are inevitably admissible. Rather, the point is that such cases are not covered by the per se rule of 11(e)(6) and thus must be resolved by that body of law dealing with police interrogations.</p>
<p class="note-body">If there has been a plea of guilty later withdrawn or a plea of nolo contendere, subdivision (e)(6)(C) makes inadmissible statements made &ldquo;in the course of any proceedings under this rule&rdquo; regarding such pleas. This includes, for example, admissions by the defendant when he makes his plea in court pursuant to rule 11 and also admissions made to provide the factual basis pursuant to subdivision (f). However, subdivision (e)(6)(C) is not limited to statements made in court. If the court were to defer its decision on a plea agreement pending examination of the presentence report, as authorized by subdivision (e)(2), statements made to the probation officer in connection with the preparation of that report would come within this provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">This amendment is fully consistent with all recent and major law reform efforts on this subject. ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure &sect;350.7 (Proposed Official Draft, 1975), and ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.4 (Approved Draft, 1968) both provide:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Unless the defendant subsequently enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere which is not withdrawn, the fact that the defendant or his counsel and the prosecuting attorney engaged in plea discussions or made a plea agreement should not be received in evidence against or in favor of the defendant in any criminal or civil action or administrative proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The Commentary to the latter states:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The above standard is limited to discussions and agreements with the prosecuting attorney. Sometimes defendants will indicate to the police their willingness to bargain, and in such instances these statements are sometimes admitted in court against the defendant. <em>State v. Christian</em>, 245 S.W.2d 895 (Mo.1952). If the police initiate this kind of discussion, this may have some bearing on the admissibility of the defendant's statement. However, the policy considerations relevant to this issue are better dealt with in the context of standards governing in-custody interrogation by the police.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Similarly, Unif.R.Crim.P. 441(d) (Approved Draft, 1974), provides that except under limited circumstances &ldquo;no discussion between the parties or statement by the defendant or his lawyer under this Rule,&rdquo; i.e., the rule providing &ldquo;the parties may meet to discuss the possibility of pretrial diversion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* or of a plea agreement,&rdquo; are admissible. The amendment is likewise consistent with the typical state provision on this subject; see, e.g., Ill.S.Ct. Rule 402(f).</p>
<p class="note-body">The language of the amendment identifies with more precision than the present language the necessary relationship between the statements and the plea or discussion. See the dispute between the majority and concurring opinions in <em>United States v. Herman</em>, 544 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1977), concerning the meanings and effect of the phrases &ldquo;connection to&rdquo; and &ldquo;relevant to&rdquo; in the present rule. Moreover, by relating the statements to &ldquo;plea discussions&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;an offer to plead,&rdquo; the amendment ensures &ldquo;that even an attempt to open plea bargaining [is] covered under the same rule of inadmissibility.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Brooks</em>, 536 F.2d 1137 (6th Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of Rule 11(e)(6) is amended to provide a second exception to the general rule of nonadmissibility of the described statements. Under the amendment, such a statement is also admissible &ldquo;in any proceeding wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it.&rdquo; This change is necessary so that, when evidence of statements made in the course of or as a consequence of a certain plea or plea discussions are introduced under circumstances not prohibited by this rule (e.g., not &ldquo;against&rdquo; the person who made the plea), other statements relating to <!-- PDFPage:47 -->the same plea or plea discussions may also be admitted when relevant to the matter at issue. For example, if a defendant upon a motion to dismiss a prosecution on some ground were able to admit certain statements made in aborted plea discussions in his favor, then other relevant statements made in the same plea discussions should be admissible against the defendant in the interest of determining the truth of the matter at issue. The language of the amendment follows closely that in Fed.R.Evid. 106, as the considerations involved are very similar.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;in any civil or criminal proceeding&rdquo; has been moved from its present position, following the word &ldquo;against,&rdquo; for purposes of clarity. An ambiguity presently exists because the word &ldquo;against&rdquo; may be read as referring either to the kind of proceeding in which the evidence is offered or the purpose for which it is offered. The change makes it clear that the latter construction is correct. No change is intended with respect to provisions making evidence rules inapplicable in certain situations. See, e.g., Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) and 1101(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.4 (Approved Draft, 1968), and ALI Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure &sect;350.7 (Proposed Official Draft, 1975), rule 11(e)(6) does not also provide that the described evidence is inadmissible &ldquo;in favor of&rdquo; the defendant. This is not intended to suggest, however, that such evidence will inevitably be admissible in the defendant's favor. Specifically, no disapproval is intended of such decisions as <em>United States v. Verdoorn</em>, 528 F.2d 103 (8th Cir. 1976), holding that the trial judge properly refused to permit the defendants to put into evidence at their trial the fact the prosecution had attempted to plea bargain with them, as &ldquo;meaningful dialogue between the parties would, as a practical matter, be impossible if either party had to assume the risk that plea offers would be admissible in evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(1). Subdivision (c)(1) has been amended by specifying &ldquo;the effect of any special parole term&rdquo; as one of the matters about which a defendant who has tendered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is to be advised by the court. This amendment does not make any change in the law, as the courts are in agreement that such advice is presently required by Rule 11. See, e.g., <em>Moore v. United States</em>, 592 F.2d 753 (4th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Eaton</em>, 579 F.2d 1181 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Richardson v. United States</em>, 577 F.2d 447 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Del Prete</em>, 567 F.2d 928 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Watson</em>, 548 F.2d 1058 (D.C.Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Crusco</em>, 536 F.2d 21 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Yazbeck</em>, 524 F.2d 641 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Wolak</em>, 510 F.2d 164 (6th Cir. 1975). In <em>United States v. Timmreck</em>, 441 U.S. 780 (1979), 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979), the Supreme Court assumed that the judge's failure in that case to describe the mandatory special parole term constituted &ldquo;a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the amendment is to draw more specific attention to the fact that advice concerning special parole terms is a necessary part of Rule 11 procedure. As noted in <em>Moore v. United States</em>, supra:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Special parole is a significant penalty. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Unlike ordinary parole, which does not involve supervision beyond the original prison term set by the court and the violation of which cannot lead to confinement beyond that sentence, special parole increases the possible period of confinement. It entails the possibility that a defendant may have to serve his original sentence plus a substantial additional period, without credit for time spent on parole. Explanation of special parole in open court is therefore essential to comply with the Rule's mandate that the defendant be informed of &ldquo;the maximum possible penalty provided by law.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">As the aforecited cases indicate, in the absence of specification of the requirement in the rule it has sometimes happened that such advice has been inadvertently omitted from Rule 11 warnings.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment does not attempt to enumerate all of the characteristics of the special parole term which the judge ought to bring to the defendant's attention. Some flexibility in this respect must be preserved although it is well to note that the unique characteristics of this kind of parole are such that they may not be readily perceived by laymen. <em>Moore v. United States</em> supra, recommends that in an appropriate case the judge</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;inform the defendant and determine that he understands the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(1) that a special parole term will be added to any prison sentence he receives;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(2) the minimum length of the special parole term that must be imposed and the absence of a statutory maximum;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(3) that special parole is entirely different from&mdash;and in addition to&mdash;ordinary parole; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(4) that if the special parole is violated, the defendant can be returned to prison for the remainder of his sentence and the full length of his special parole term.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment should not be read as meaning that a failure to comply with this particular requirement will inevitably entitle the defendant to relief. See <em>United States v. Timmreck</em>, supra. Likewise, the amendment makes no change in the existing law to the effect</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;that many aspects of traditional parole need not be communicated to the defendant by the trial judge under the umbrella of Rule 11. For example, a defendant need not be advised of all conceivable consequences such as when he may be considered for parole or that, if he violates his parole, he will again be imprisoned.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>Bunker v. Wise</em>, 550 F.2d 1155, 1158 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(4). The amendment to subdivision (c)(4) is intended to overcome the present conflict between the introductory language of subdivision (c), which contemplates the advice being given &ldquo;[b]efore accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,&rdquo; and thus presumably after the plea has been tendered, and the &ldquo;if he pleads&rdquo; language of subdivision (c)(4) which suggests the plea has not been tendered.</p>
<p class="note-body">As noted by Judge Doyle in <em>United States v. Sinagub</em>, 468 F.Supp. 353 (W.D.Wis.1979):</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken literally, this wording of subsection (4) of 11(c) suggests that before eliciting any plea at an arraignment, the court is required to insure that a defendant understands that if he or she pleads guilty or nolo contendere, the defendant will be waiving the right to trial. Under subsection (3) of 11(c), however, there is no requirement that at this pre-plea stage, the court must insure that the defendant understands that he or she enjoys the right to a trial and, at trial, the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him or her, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself or herself. It would be incongruous to require that at the pre-plea stage the court insure that the defendant understands that if he enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere he will be waiving a right, the existence and nature of which need not be explained until after such a plea has been entered. I conclude that the insertion of the words &ldquo;that if he pleads guilty or nolo contendere,&rdquo; as they appear in subsection (4) of 11(c), was an accident of draftsmanship which occurred in the course of Congressional rewriting of 11(c) as it has been approved by the Supreme Court. Those words are to be construed consistently with the words &ldquo;Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,&rdquo; as they appear in the opening language of 11(c), and consistently with the omission of the words &ldquo;that if he pleads&rdquo; from subsections (1), (2), and (3) of 11(c). That is, as they appear in subsection (4) of 11(c), the words, &ldquo;that if he pleads guilty or nolo contendere&rdquo; should be construed to mean &ldquo;that if his plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted by the court.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:48 --><p class="note-body-block">Although this is a very logical interpretation of the present language, the amendment will avoid the necessity to engage in such analysis in order to determine the true meaning of subdivision (c)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(5). Subdivision (c)(5), in its present form, may easily be read as contemplating that in every case in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is tendered, warnings must be given about the possible use of defendant's statements, obtained under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel, in a later prosecution for perjury or false statement. The language has prompted some courts to reach the remarkable result that a defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contendere without receiving those warnings must be allowed to overturn his plea on appeal even though he was never questioned under oath, on the record, in the presence of counsel about the offense to which he pleaded. <em>United States v. Artis</em>, No. 78&ndash;5012 (4th Cir. March 12, 1979); <em>United States v. Boone</em>, 543 F.2d 1090 (4th Cir. 1976). Compare <em>United States v. Michaelson</em>, 552 F.2d 472 (2d Cir. 1977) (failure to give subdivision (c)(5) warnings not a basis for reversal, &ldquo;at least when, as here, defendant was not put under oath before questioning about his guilty plea&rdquo;). The present language of subdivision (c)(5) may also have contributed to the conclusion, not otherwise supported by the rule, that &ldquo;Rule 11 requires that the defendant be under oath for the entirety of the proceedings&rdquo; conducted pursuant to that rule and that failure to place the defendant under oath would itself make necessary overturning the plea on appeal. <em>United States v. Aldridge</em>, 553 F.2d 922 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="note-body">When questioning of the kind described in subdivision (c)(5) is not contemplated by the judge who is receiving the plea, no purpose is served by giving the (c)(5) warnings, which in such circumstances can only confuse the defendant and detract from the force of the other warnings required by Rule 11. As correctly noted in <em>United States v. Sinagub</em>, supra,</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;subsection (5) of section (c) of Rule 11 is qualitatively distinct from the other sections of the Rule. It does not go to whether the plea is knowingly or voluntarily made, nor to whether the plea should be accepted and judgment entered. Rather, it does go to the possible consequences of an event which may or may not occur during the course of the arraignment hearing itself, namely, the administration of an oath to the defendant. Whether this event is to occur is wholly within the control of the presiding judge. If the event is not to occur, it is pointless to inform the defendant of its consequences. If a presiding judge intends that an oath not be administered to a defendant during an arraignment hearing, but alters that intention at some point, only then would the need arise to inform the defendant of the possible consequences of the administration of the oath.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The amendment to subdivision (c)(5) is intended to make it clear that this is the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment limits the circumstances in which the warnings must be given, but does not change the fact, as noted in <em>Sinagub</em> that these warnings are &ldquo;qualitatively distinct&rdquo; from the other advice required by Rule 11(c). This being the case, a failure to give the subdivision (c)(5) warnings even when the defendant was questioned under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel would in no way affect the validity of the defendant's plea. Rather, this failure bears upon the admissibility of defendant's answers pursuant to subdivision (e)(6) in a later prosecution for perjury or false statement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). There are many defenses, objections and requests which a defendant must ordinarily raise by pretrial motion. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &sect;3162(a)(2); Fed.R.Crim.P.12(b). Should that motion be denied, interlocutory appeal of the ruling by the defendant is seldom permitted. See <em>United States v. MacDonald</em>, 435 U.S. 850 (1978) (defendant may not appeal denial of his motion to dismiss based upon Sixth Amendment speedy trial grounds); <em>DiBella v. United States</em>, 369 U.S. 121 (1962) (defendant may not appeal denial of pretrial motion to suppress evidence); compare <em>Abney v. United States</em>, 431 U.S. 651 (1977) (interlocutory appeal of denial of motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds permissible). Moreover, should the defendant thereafter plead guilty or nolo contendere, this will usually foreclose later appeal with respect to denial of the pretrial motion &ldquo;When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.&rdquo; <em>Tollett v. Henderson</em>, 411 U.S. 258, (1973). Though a nolo plea differs from a guilty plea in other respects, it is clear that it also constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects in a manner equivalent to a guilty plea. <em>Lott v. United States</em>, 367 U.S. 421 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">As a consequence, a defendant who has lost one or more pretrial motions will often go through an entire trial simply to preserve the pretrial issues for later appellate review. This results in a waste of prosecutorial and judicial resources, and causes delay in the trial of other cases, contrary to the objectives underlying the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3161 et seq. These unfortunate consequences may be avoided by the conditional plea device expressly authorized by new subdivision (a)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The development of procedures to avoid the necessity for trials which are undertaken for the sole purpose of preserving pretrial objections has been consistently favored by the commentators. See ABA Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice, standard 21&ndash;1.3(c) (2d ed. 1978); Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure &sect;SS 290.1(4)(b) (1975); Uniform Rules of Criminal Procedure, rule 444(d) (Approved Draft, 1974); 1 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure &mdash; Criminal &sect;175 (1969); 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure &sect;11.1 (1978). The Supreme Court has characterized the New York practice, whereby appeals from suppression motions may be appealed notwithstanding a guilty plea, as a &ldquo;commendable effort to relieve the problem of congested trial calendars in a manner that does not diminish the opportunity for the assertion of rights guaranteed by the Constitution.&rdquo; <em>Lefkowitz v. Newsome</em>, 420 U.S. 283, 293 (1975). That Court has never discussed conditional pleas as such, but has permitted without comment a federal appeal on issues preserved by a conditional plea. <em>Jaben v. United States</em>, 381 U.S. 214 (1965).</p>
<p class="note-body">In the absence of specific authorization by statute or rule for a conditional plea, the circuits have divided on the permissibility of the practice. Two circuits have actually approved the entry of conditional pleas, <em>United States v. Burke</em>, 517 F.2d 377 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Moskow</em>, 588 F.2d 882 (3d Cir. 1978); and two others have praised the conditional plea concept, <em>United States v. Clark</em>, 459 F.2d 977 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Dorsey</em>, 449 F.2d 1104 (D.C.Cir. 1971). Three circuits have expressed the view that a conditional plea is logically inconsistent and thus improper, <em>United States v. Brown</em>, 499 F.2d 829 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Sepe</em>, 472 F.2d 784, aff'd en banc, 486 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Cox</em>, 464 F.2d 937 (6th Cir. 1972); three others have determined only that conditional pleas are not now authorized in the federal system, <em>United States v. Benson</em>, 579 F.2d 508 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Nooner</em>, 565 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Matthews</em>, 472 F.2d 1173 (4th Cir. 1973); while one circuit has reserved judgment on the issue, <em>United States v. Warwar</em>, 478 F.2d 1183 (1st Cir. 1973). (At the state level, a few jurisdictions by statute allow appeal from denial of a motion to suppress notwithstanding a subsequent guilty plea, Cal. Penal Code &sect;1538.5(m); N.Y.Crim. Proc. Law &sect;710.20(1); Wis.Stat.Ann. &sect;971.31(10), but in the absence of such a provision the state courts are also in disagreement as to whether a conditional plea is permissible; see cases collected in Comment, 26 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 360, 373 (1978).)</p>
<!-- PDFPage:49 --><p class="note-body">The conditional plea procedure provided for in subdivision (a)(2) will, as previously noted, serve to conserve prosecutorial and judicial resources and advance speedy trial objectives. It will also produce much needed uniformity in the federal system on this matter; see <em>United States v. Clark</em>, supra, noting the split of authority and urging resolution by statute or rule. Also, the availability of a conditional plea under specified circumstances will aid in clarifying the fact that traditional, unqualified pleas do constitute a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects. See <em>United States v. Nooner</em>, supra (defendant sought appellate review of denial of pretrial suppression motion, despite his prior unqualified guilty plea, claiming the Second Circuit conditional plea practice led him to believe a guilty plea did not bar appeal of pretrial issues).</p>
<p class="note-body">The obvious advantages of the conditional plea procedure authorized by subdivision (a)(2) are not outweighed by any significant or compelling disadvantages. As noted in Comment, supra, at 375: &ldquo;Four major arguments have been raised by courts disapproving of conditioned pleas. The objections are that the procedure encourages a flood of appellate litigation, militates against achieving finality in the criminal process, reduces effectiveness of appellate review due to the lack of a full trial record, and forces decision on constitutional questions that could otherwise be avoided by invoking the harmless error doctrine.&rdquo; But, as concluded therein, those &ldquo;arguments do not withstand close analysis.&rdquo; Ibid.</p>
<p class="note-body">As for the first of those arguments, experience in states which have permitted appeals of suppression motions notwithstanding a subsequent plea of guilty is most relevant, as conditional pleas are likely to be most common when the objective is to appeal that kind of pretrial ruling. That experience has shown that the number of appeals has not increased substantially. See Comment, 9 Hous.L.Rev. 305, 315&ndash;19 (1971). The minimal added burden at the appellate level is certainly a small price to pay for avoiding otherwise unnecessary trials.</p>
<p class="note-body">As for the objection that conditional pleas conflict with the government's interest in achieving finality, it is likewise without force. While it is true that the conditional plea does not have the complete finality of the traditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere because &ldquo;the essence of the agreement is that the legal guilt of the defendant exists only if the prosecution's case&rdquo; survives on appeal, the plea</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;continues to serve a partial state interest in finality, however, by establishing admission of the defendant's factual guilt. The defendant stands guilty and the proceedings come to an end if the reserved issue is ultimately decided in the government's favor.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Comment, 26 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 360, 378 (1978).</p>
<p class="note-body">The claim that the lack of a full trial record precludes effective appellate review may on occasion be relevant. Cf. <em>United States v. MacDonald</em>, supra (holding interlocutory appeal not available for denial of defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss, on speedy trial grounds, and noting that &ldquo;most speedy trial claims *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are best considered only after the relevant facts have been developed at trial&rdquo;). However, most of the objections which would likely be raised by pretrial motion and preserved for appellate review by a conditional plea are subject to appellate resolution without a trial record. Certainly this is true as to the very common motion to suppress evidence, as is indicated by the fact that appellate courts presently decide such issues upon interlocutory appeal by the government.</p>
<p class="note-body">With respect to the objection that conditional pleas circumvent application of the harmless error doctrine, it must be acknowledged that &ldquo;[a]bsent a full trial record, containing all the government's evidence against the defendant, invocation of the harmless error rule is arguably impossible.&rdquo; Comment, supra, at 380. But, the harmless error standard with respect to constitutional objections is sufficiently high, see <em>Chapman v. California</em>, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), that relatively few appellate decisions result in affirmance upon that basis. Thus it will only rarely be true that the conditional plea device will cause an appellate court to consider constitutional questions which could otherwise have been avoided by invocation of the doctrine of harmless error.</p>
<p class="note-body">To the extent that these or related objections would otherwise have some substance, they are overcome by the provision in Rule 11(a)(2) that the defendant may enter a conditional plea only &ldquo;with the approval of the court and the consent of the government.&rdquo; (In this respect, the rule adopts the practice now found in the Second Circuit.) The requirement of approval by the court is most appropriate, as it ensures, for example, that the defendant is not allowed to take an appeal on a matter which can only be fully developed by proceeding to trial; cf. <em>United States v. MacDonald</em>, supra. As for consent by the government, it will ensure that conditional pleas will be allowed only when the decision of the court of appeals will dispose of the case either by allowing the plea to stand or by such action as compelling dismissal of the indictment or suppressing essential evidence. Absent such circumstances, the conditional plea might only serve to postpone the trial and require the government to try the case after substantial delay, during which time witnesses may be lost, memories dimmed, and the offense grown so stale as to lose jury appeal. The government is in a unique position to determine whether the matter at issue would be case-dispositive, and, as a party to the litigation, should have an absolute right to refuse to consent to potentially prejudicial delay. Although it was suggested in <em>United States v. Moskow</em>, supra, that the government should have no right to prevent the entry of a conditional plea because a defendant has no comparable right to block government appeal of a pretrial ruling pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect;3731, that analogy is unconvincing. That statute requires the government to certify that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. Moreover, where the pretrial ruling is case-dispositive, &sect;3731 is the only mechanism by which the government can obtain appellate review, but a defendant may always obtain review by pleading not guilty.</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike the state statutes cited earlier, Rule 11(a)(2) is not limited to instances in which the pretrial ruling the defendant wishes to appeal was in response to defendant's motion to suppress evidence. Though it may be true that the conditional plea device will be most commonly employed as to such rulings, the objectives of the rule are well served by extending it to other pretrial rulings as well. See, e.g., ABA Standards, supra (declaring the New York provision &ldquo;should be enlarged to include other pretrial defenses&rdquo;); Uniform Rules of Criminal Procedure, rule 444(d) (Approved Draft, 1974) (&ldquo;any pretrial motion which, if granted, would be dispositive of the case&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the conditional plea be made by the defendant &ldquo;reserving in writing the right to appeal from the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion,&rdquo; though extending beyond the Second Circuit practice, will ensure careful attention to any conditional plea. It will document that a particular plea was in fact conditional, and will identify precisely what pretrial issues have been preserved for appellate review. By requiring this added step, it will be possible to avoid entry of a conditional plea without the considered acquiescence of the government (see <em>United States v. Burke</em>, supra, holding that failure of the government to object to entry of a conditional plea constituted consent) and post-plea claims by the defendant that his plea should be deemed conditional merely because it occurred after denial of his pretrial motions (see <em>United States v. Nooner</em>, supra).</p>
<p class="note-body">It must be emphasized that the <em>only</em> avenue of review of the specified pretrial ruling permitted under a rule 11(a)(2) conditional plea is an appeal, which must be brought in compliance with Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). Relief via 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 is not available for this purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court has held that certain kinds of constitutional objections may be raised after a plea of guilty. <em>Menna v. New York</em>, 423 U.S. 61 (1975) (double <!-- PDFPage:50 -->jeopardy violation); <em>Blackledge v. Perry</em>, 417 U.S. 21 (1974) (due process violation by charge enhancement following defendant's exercise of right to trial de novo). Subdivision 11(a)(2) has no application to such situations, and should not be interpreted as either broadening or narrowing the <em>Menna-Blackledge</em> doctrine or as establishing procedures for its application.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (h). Subdivision (h) makes clear that the harmless error rule of Rule 52(a) is applicable to Rule 11. The provision does not, however, attempt to define the meaning of &ldquo;harmless error,&rdquo; which is left to the case law. Prior to the amendments which took effect on Dec. 1, 1975, Rule 11 was very brief; it consisted of but four sentences. The 1975 amendments increased significantly the procedures which must be undertaken when a defendant tenders a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, but this change was warranted by the &ldquo;two principal objectives&rdquo; then identified in the Advisory Committee Note: (1) ensuring that the defendant has made an informed plea; and (2) ensuring that plea agreements are brought out into the open in court. An inevitable consequence of the 1975 amendments was some increase in the risk that a trial judge, in a particular case, might inadvertently deviate to some degree from the procedure which a very literal reading of Rule 11 would appear to require.</p>
<p class="note-body">This being so, it became more apparent than ever that Rule 11 should not be given such a crabbed interpretation that ceremony was exalted over substance. As stated in <em>United States v. Scarf</em>, 551 F.2d 1124 (8th Cir. 1977), concerning amended Rule 11: &ldquo;It is a salutary rule, and district courts are required to act in substantial compliance with it although *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* ritualistic compliance is not required.&rdquo; As similarly pointed out in <em>United States v. Saft</em>, 558 F.2d 1073 (2d Cir. 1977),</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;the Rule does note say that compliance can be achieved only by reading the specified items <em>in haec verba</em>. Congress meant to strip district judges of freedom to decide <em>what</em> they must explain to a defendant who wishes to plead guilty, not to tell them precisely <em>how</em> to perform this important task in the great variety of cases that would come before them. While a judge who contents himself with literal application of the Rule will hardly be reversed, it cannot be supposed that Congress preferred this to a more meaningful explanation, provided that all the specified elements were covered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two important points logically flow from these sound observations. One concerns the matter of construing Rule 11: it is not to be read as requiring a litany or other ritual which can be carried out only by word-for-word adherence to a set &ldquo;script.&rdquo; The other, specifically addressed in new subdivision (h), is that even when it may be concluded Rule 11 has not been complied with in all respects, it does not inevitably follow that the defendant's plea of guilty or nolo contendere is invalid and subject to being overturned by any remedial device then available to the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Notwithstanding the declaration in Rule 52(a) that &ldquo;[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded,&rdquo; there has existed for some years considerable disagreement concerning the applicability of the harmless error doctrine to Rule 11 violations. In large part, this is attributable to uncertainty as to the continued vitality and the reach of <em>McCarthy v. United States</em>, 394 U.S. 459 (1969). In <em>McCarthy</em>, involving a direct appeal from a plea of guilty because of noncompliance with Rule 11, the Court concluded</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;that prejudice inheres in a failure to comply with Rule 11, for noncompliance deprives the defendant of the Rule's procedural safeguards, which are designed to facilitate a more accurate determination of the voluntariness of his plea. Our holding [is] that a defendant whose plea has been accepted in violation of Rule 11 should be afforded the opportunity to plead anew *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>McCarthy</em> has been most frequently relied upon in cases where, as in that case, the defendant sought relief because of a Rule 11 violation by the avenue of direct appeal. It has been held that in such circumstances a defendant's conviction must be reversed whenever the &ldquo;district court accepts his guilty plea without fully adhering to the procedure provided for in Rule 11,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Boone</em>, 543 F.2d 1090 (4th Cir. 1976), and that in this context any reliance by the government on the Rule 52(a) harmless error concept &ldquo;must be rejected.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Journet</em>, 544 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1976). On the other hand, decisions are to be found taking a harmless error approach on direct appeal where it appeared the nature and extent of the deviation from Rule 11 was such that it could not have had any impact on the defendant's decision to plead or the fairness in now holding him to his plea. <em>United States v. Peters</em>, No. 77&ndash;1700 (4th Cir., Dec. 22, 1978) (where judge failed to comply fully with Rule 11(c)(1), in that defendant not correctly advised of maximum years of special parole term but was told it is at least 3 years, and defendant thereafter sentenced to 15 years plus 3-year special parole term, government's motion for summary affirmance granted, as &ldquo;the error was harmless&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Coronado</em>, 554 F.2d 166 (5th Cir. 1977) (court first holds that charge of conspiracy requires some explanation of what conspiracy means to comply with Rule 11(c)(1), but then finds no reversible error &ldquo;because the rule 11 proceeding on its face discloses, despite the trial court's failure sufficiently to make the required explicitation of the charges, that Coronado understood them&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">But this conflict has not been limited to cases involving nothing more than a direct appeal following defendant's plea. For example, another type of case is that in which the defendant has based a post-sentence motion to withdraw his plea on a Rule 11 violation. Rule 32(d) says that such a motion may be granted &ldquo;to correct manifest injustice,&rdquo; and some courts have relied upon this latter provision in holding that post-sentence plea withdrawal need not be permitted merely because Rule 11 was not fully complied with and that instead the district court should hold an evidentiary hearing to determine &ldquo;whether manifest injustice will result if the conviction based on the guilty plea is permitted to stand.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Scarf</em>, 551 F.2d 1124 (8th Cir. 1977). Others, however, have held that <em>McCarthy</em> applies and prevails over the language of Rule 32(d), so that &ldquo;a failure to scrupulously comply with Rule 11 will invalidate a plea without a showing of manifest injustice.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Cantor</em>, 469 F.2d 435 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>
<p class="note-body">Disagreement has also existed in the context of collateral attack upon pleas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. On the one hand, it has been concluded that &ldquo;[n]ot every violation of Rule 11 requires that the plea be set aside&rdquo; in a &sect;2255 proceeding, and that &ldquo;a guilty plea will be set aside on collateral attack only where to not do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, or where there exists exceptional circumstances justifying such relief.&rdquo; <em>Evers v. United States</em>, 579 F.2d 71 (10th Cir. 1978). The contrary view was that <em>McCarthy</em> governed in &sect;2255 proceedings because &ldquo;the Supreme Court hinted at no exceptions to its policy of strict enforcement of Rule 11.&rdquo; <em>Timmreck v. United States</em>, 577 F.2d 377 (6th Cir. 1978). But a unanimous Supreme Court resolved this conflict in <em>United States v. Timmreck</em>, 441 U.S. 780 (1979), where the Court concluded that the reasoning of <em>Hill v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 424 (1962) (ruling a collateral attack could not be predicated on a violation of Rule 32(a))</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">is equally applicable to a formal violation of Rule 11.*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Indeed, if anything, this case may be a stronger one for foreclosing collateral relief than the <em>Hill</em> case. For the concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Every inroad on the concept of finality undermines confidence in the integrity of our procedures; and, by increasing the volume of judicial work, inevitably delays and impairs the orderly administration of justice. The impact is greatest when new grounds for setting aside guilty pleas are approved because the vast majority of criminal convictions <!-- PDFPage:51 -->result from such pleas. Moreover, the concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant is only rarely raised by a petition to set aside a guilty plea.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">This interest in finality is strongest in the collateral attack context the Court was dealing with in <em>Timmreck</em>, which explains why the Court there adopted the <em>Hill</em> requirement that in a &sect;2255 proceeding the rule violation must amount to &ldquo;a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice&rdquo; or &ldquo;an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.&rdquo; The interest in finality of guilty pleas described in <em>Timmreck</em> is of somewhat lesser weight when a direct appeal is involved (so that the <em>Hill</em> standard is obviously inappropriate in that setting), but yet is sufficiently compelling to make unsound the proposition that reversal is required even where it is apparent that the Rule 11 violation was of the harmless error variety.</p>
<p class="note-body">Though the <em>McCarthy</em> per se rule may have been justified at the time and in the circumstances which obtained when the plea in that case was taken, this is no longer the case. For one thing, it is important to recall that <em>McCarthy</em> dealt only with the much simpler pre-1975 version of Rule 11, which required only a brief procedure during which the chances of a minor, insignificant and inadvertent deviation were relatively slight. This means that the chances of a <em>truly</em> harmless error (which was not involved in <em>McCarthy</em> in any event, as the judge made <em>no</em> inquiry into the defendant's understanding of the nature of the charge, and the government had presented only the extreme argument that a court &ldquo;could properly <em>assume</em> that petitioner was entering that plea with a complete understanding of the charge against him&rdquo; merely from the fact he had stated he desired to plead guilty) are much greater under present Rule 11 than under the version before the Court in <em>McCarthy</em>. It also means that the more elaborate and lengthy procedures of present Rule 11, again as compared with the version applied in <em>McCarthy</em>, make it more apparent than ever that a guilty plea is not &ldquo;a mere gesture, a temporary and meaningless formality reversible at the defendant's whim,&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;a grave and solemn act,&rsquo; which is &lsquo;accepted only with care and discernment.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>United States v. Barker</em>, 514 F.2d 208 (D.C.Cir.1975), quoting from <em>Brady v. United States</em>, 397 U.S. 742 (1970). A plea of that character should not be overturned, even on direct appeal, when there has been a minor and technical violation of Rule 11 which amounts to harmless error.</p>
<p class="note-body">Secondly, while <em>McCarthy</em> involved a situation in which the defendant's plea of guilty was before the court of appeals on direct appeal, the Supreme Court appears to have been primarily concerned with &sect;2255-type cases, for the Court referred exclusively to cases of that kind in the course of concluding that a per se rule was justified as to Rule 11 violations because of &ldquo;the difficulty of achieving [rule 11's] purposes through a post-conviction voluntariness hearing.&rdquo; But that reasoning has now been substantially undercut by <em>United States v. Timmreck</em>, supra, for the Court there concluded &sect;2255 relief &ldquo;is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule,&rdquo; at least absent &ldquo;other aggravating circumstances,&rdquo; which presumably could often only be developed in the course of a later evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although all of the aforementioned considerations support the policy expressed in new subdivision (h), the Advisory Committee does wish to emphasize two important cautionary notes. The first is that subdivision (h) should <em>not</em> be read as supporting extreme or speculative harmless error claims or as, in effect, nullifying important Rule 11 safeguards. There would <em>not</em> be harmless error under subdivision (h) where, for example, as in <em>McCarthy</em>, there had been absolutely no inquiry by the judge into defendant's understanding of the nature of the charge and the harmless error claim of the government rests upon nothing more than the assertion that it may be &ldquo;assumed&rdquo; defendant possessed such understanding merely because he expressed a desire to plead guilty. Likewise, it would <em>not</em> be harmless error if the trial judge totally abdicated to the prosecutor the responsibility for giving to the defendant the various Rule 11 warnings, as this &ldquo;results in the creation of an atmosphere of subtle coercion that clearly contravenes the policy behind Rule 11.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Crook</em>, 526 F.2d 708 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="note-body">Indeed, it is fair to say that the kinds of Rule 11 violations which might be found to constitute harmless error upon direct appeal are fairly limited, as in such instances the matter &ldquo;must be resolved solely on the basis of the Rule 11 transcript&rdquo; and the other portions (e.g., sentencing hearing) of the limited record made in such cases. <em>United States v. Coronado</em>, supra. Illustrative are: where the judge's compliance with subdivision (c)(1) was not absolutely complete, in that some essential element of the crime was not mentioned, but the defendant's responses clearly indicate his awareness of that element, see <em>United States v. Coronado</em>, supra; where the judge's compliance with subdivision (c)(2) was erroneous in part in that the judge understated the maximum penalty somewhat, but the penalty actually imposed did not exceed that indicated in the warnings, see <em>United States v. Peters</em>, supra; and where the judge completely failed to comply with subdivision (c)(5), which of course has no bearing on the validity of the plea itself, cf. <em>United States v. Sinagub</em>, supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second cautionary note is that subdivision (h) should <em>not</em> be read as an invitation to trial judges to take a more casual approach to Rule 11 proceedings. It is still true, as the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>McCarthy</em>, that thoughtful and careful compliance with Rule 11 best serves the cause of fair and efficient administration of criminal justice, as it</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;will help reduce the great waste of judicial resources required to process the frivolous attacks on guilty plea convictions that are encouraged, and are more difficult to dispose of, when the original record is inadequate. It is, therefore, not too much to require that, before sentencing defendants to years of imprisonment, district judges take the few minutes necessary to inform them of their rights and to determine whether they understand the action they are taking.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Subdivision (h) makes <em>no change</em> in the responsibilities of the judge at Rule 11 proceedings, but instead merely rejects the extreme sanction of automatic reversal.</p>
<p class="note-body">It must also be emphasized that a harmless error provision has been added to Rule 11 because some courts have read <em>McCarthy</em> as meaning that the general harmless error provision in Rule 52(a) cannot be utilized with respect to Rule 11 proceedings. Thus, the addition of subdivision (h) should <em>not</em> be read as suggesting that Rule 52(a) does not apply in other circumstances because of the absence of a provision comparable to subdivision (h) attached to other rules.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(1). Section 5 of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97&ndash;291, 96 Stat. 1248 (1982), adds 18 U.S.C. &sect;3579, providing that when sentencing a defendant convicted of a Title 18 offense or of violating various subsections of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, the court &ldquo;may order, in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to any victim of the offense.&rdquo; Under this law restitution is favored; if the court &ldquo;does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the court shall state on the record the reasons therefor.&rdquo; Because this restitution is deemed an aspect of the defendant's sentence, S. Rept. No. 97&ndash;532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 30&ndash;33 (1982), it is a matter about which a defendant tendering a plea of guilty or nolo contendere should be advised.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because this new legislation contemplates that the amount of the restitution to be ordered will be ascertained later in the sentencing process, this amendment to Rule 11(c)(1) merely requires that the defendant be told of the court's power to order restitution. The exact <!-- PDFPage:52 -->amount or upper limit cannot and need not be stated at the time of the plea. Failure of a court to advise a defendant of the possibility of a restitution order would constitute harmless error under subdivision (h) if no restitution were thereafter ordered.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment mandates that the district court inform a defendant that the court is required to consider any applicable guidelines but may depart from them under some circumstances. This requirement assures that the existence of guidelines will be known to a defendant before a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted. Since it will be impracticable, if not impossible, to know which guidelines will be relevant prior to the formulation of a presentence report and resolution of disputed facts, the amendment does not require the court to specify which guidelines will be important or which grounds for departure might prove to be significant. The advice that the court is required to give cannot guarantee that a defendant who pleads guilty will not later claim a lack of understanding as to the importance of guidelines at the time of the plea. No advice is likely to serve as a complete protection against post-plea claims of ignorance or confusion. By giving the advice, the court places the defendant and defense counsel on notice of the importance that guidelines may play in sentencing and of the possibility of a departure from those guidelines. A defendant represented by competent counsel will be in a position to enter an intelligent plea.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule does not limit the district court's discretion to engage in a more extended colloquy with the defendant in order to impart additional information about sentencing guidelines or to inquire into the defendant's knowledge concerning guidelines. The amended rule sets forth only the minimum advice that must be provided to the defendant by the court.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 12. Pleadings and Motions Before Trial; Defenses and Objections</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Pleadings and Motions</cap-smallcap>. Pleadings in criminal proceedings shall be the indictment and the information, and the pleas of not guilty, guilty and nolo contendere. All other pleas, and demurrers and motions to quash are abolished, and defenses and objections raised before trial which heretofore could have been raised by one or more of them shall be raised only by motion to dismiss or to grant appropriate relief, as provided in these rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Pretrial Motions</cap-smallcap>. Any defense, objection, or request which is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue may be raised before trial by motion. Motions may be written or oral at the discretion of the judge. The following must be raised prior to trial:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Defenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment or information (other than that it fails to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense which objections shall be noticed by the court at any time during the pendency of the proceedings); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Motions to suppress evidence; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Requests for discovery under Rule 16; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Requests for a severance of charges or defendants under Rule 14.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Motion Date</cap-smallcap>. Unless otherwise provided by local rule, the court may, at the time of the arraignment or as soon thereafter as practicable, set a time for the making of pretrial motions or requests and, if required, a later date of hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Notice by the Government of the Intention To Use Evidence.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>At the Discretion of the Government</em>. At the arraignment or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the government may give notice to the defendant of its intention to use specified evidence at trial in order to afford the defendant an opportunity to raise objections to such evidence prior to trial under subdivision (b)(3) of this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>At the Request of the Defendant</em>. At the arraignment or as soon thereafter as is practicable the defendant may, in order to afford an opportunity to move to suppress evidence under subdivision (b)(3) of this rule, request notice of the government's intention to use (in its evidence in chief at trial) any evidence which the defendant may be entitled to discover under Rule 16 subject to any relevant limitations prescribed in Rule 16.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Ruling on Motion</cap-smallcap>. A motion made before trial shall be determined before trial unless the court, for good cause, orders that it be deferred for determination at the trial of the general issue or until after verdict, but no such determination shall be deferred if a party's right to appeal is adversely affected. Where factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the court shall state its essential findings on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Failure To Raise Defenses or Objections</cap-smallcap>. Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests which must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court pursuant to subdivision (c), or prior to any ex<!-- PDFPage:53 -->tension thereof made by the court, shall constitute waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Records</cap-smallcap>. A verbatim record shall be made of all proceedings at the hearing, including such findings of fact and conclusions of law as are made orally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Determination</cap-smallcap>. If the court grants a motion based on a defect in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment or information, it may also order that the defendant be continued in custody or that bail be continued for a specified time pending the filing of a new indictment or information. Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any Act of Congress relating to periods of limitations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Production of Statements at Suppression Hearing</cap-smallcap>. Rule 26.2 applies at a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence under subdivision (b)(3) of this rule. For purposes of this subdivision, a law enforcement officer is deemed a government witness.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. This rule abolishes pleas to the jurisdiction, pleas in abatement, demurrers, special pleas in bar, and motions to quash. A motion to dismiss or for other appropriate relief is substituted for the purpose of raising all defenses and objections heretofore interposed in any of the foregoing modes. &ldquo;This should result in a reduction of opportunities for dilatory tactics and, at the same time, relieve the defense of embarrassment. Many competent practitioners have been baffled and mystified by the distinctions between pleas in abatement, pleas in bar, demurrers, and motions to quash, and have, at times, found difficulty in determining which of these should be invoked.&rdquo; Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 655. See also, Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. A similar change was introduced by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 7(a)) which has proven successful. It is also proposed by the A.L.I. Code of Criminal Procedure (Sec. 209).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b)(1) and (2). These two paragraphs classify into two groups all objections and defenses to be interposed by motion prescribed by Rule 12(a). In one group are defenses and objections which must be raised by motion, failure to do so constituting a waiver. In the other group are defenses and objections which at the defendant's option may be raised by motion, failure to do so, however, not constituting a waiver. (Cf. Rule 12 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].)</p>
<p class="note-body">In the first of these groups are included all defenses and objections that are based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment and information, other than lack of jurisdiction or failure to charge an offense. All such defenses and objections must be included in a single motion. (Cf. Rule 12(g) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].) Among the defenses and objections in this group are the following: Illegal selection or organization of the grand jury, disqualification of individual grand jurors, presence of unauthorized persons in the grand jury room, other irregularities in grand jury proceedings, defects in indictment or information other than lack of jurisdiction or failure to state an offense, etc. The provision that these defenses and objections are waived if not raised by motion substantially continues existing law, as they are waived at present unless raised before trial by plea in abatement, demurrer, motion to quash, etc.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the other group of objections and defenses, which the defendant at his option may raise by motion before trial, are included all defenses and objections which are capable of determination without a trial of the general issue. They include such matters as former jeopardy, former conviction, former acquittal, statute of limitations, immunity, lack of jurisdiction, failure of indictment or information to state an offense, etc. Such matters have been heretofore raised by demurrers, special pleas in bar and motions to quash.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b)(3). This rule, while requiring the motion to be made before pleading, vests discretionary authority in the court to permit the motion to be made within a reasonable time thereafter. The rule supersedes 18 U.S.C. 556a [now 3288, 3289], fixing a definite limitation of time for pleas in abatement and motions to quash. The rule also eliminates the requirement for technical withdrawal of a plea if it is desired to interpose a preliminary objection or defense after the plea has been entered. Under this rule a plea will be permitted to stand in the meantime.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b)(4). This rule substantially restates existing law. It leaves with the court discretion to determine in advance of trial defenses and objections raised by motion or to defer them for determination at the trial. It preserves the right to jury trial in those cases in which the right is given under the Constitution or by statute. In all other cases it vests in the court authority to determine issues of fact in such manner as the court deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b)(5). 1. The first sentence substantially restates existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 561 (Indictments and presentments; judgment on demurrer), which provides that in case a demurrer to an indictment or information is overruled, the judgment shall be <em>respondeat ouster.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">2. The last sentence of the rule that &ldquo;Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any act of Congress relating to periods of limitations&rdquo; is intended to preserve the provisions of statutes which permit a reindictment if the original indictment is found defective or is dismissed for other irregularities and the statute of limitations has run in the meantime, 18 U.S.C. 587 [now 3288] (Defective indictment; defect found after period of limitations; reindictment); <em>Id</em>. sec. 588 [now 3289] (Defective indictment; defect found before period of limitations; reindictment); <em>Id</em>. sec. 589 [now 3288, 3289] (Defective indictment; defense of limitations to new indictment); <em>Id</em>. sec. 556a [now 3288, 3289] (Indictments and presentments; objections to drawing or qualification of grand jury; time for filing; suspension of statute of limitations).</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) remains as it was in the old rule. It &ldquo;speaks only of defenses and objections that prior to the rules could have been raised by a plea, demurrer, or motion to quash&rdquo; (C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;191 at p. 397 (1969)), and this might be interpreted as limiting the scope of the rule. However, some courts have assumed that old rule 12 does apply to pretrial motions generally, and the amendments to subsequent subdivisions of the rule should make clear that the rule is applicable to pretrial motion practice generally. (See e.g., rule 12(b)(3), (4), (5) and rule 41(e).)</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is changed to provide for some additional motions and requests which must be made prior to trial. Subdivisions (b)(1) and (2) are restatements of the old rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) makes clear that objections to evidence on the ground that it was illegally obtained must be raised prior to trial. This is the current rule with regard to evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search. See rule 41(e); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;673 (1969, Supp. 1971). It is also the practice with regard to other forms of illegality such as the use of unconstitutional means to obtain a confession. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;673 at p. 108 (1969). It seems apparent <!-- PDFPage:54 -->that the same principle should apply whatever the claimed basis for the application of the exclusionary rule of evidence may be. This is consistent with the court's statement in <em>Jones v. United States</em>, 362 U.S. 257, 264, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960):</p>
<p class="note-body">This provision of Rule 41(e), requiring the motion to suppress to be made before trial, is a crystallization of decisions of this Court requiring that procedure, and is designed to eliminate from the trial disputes over police conduct not immediately relevant to the question of guilt. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(4) provides for a pretrial request for discovery by either the defendant or the government to the extent to which such discovery is authorized by rule 16.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(5) provides for a pretrial request for a severance as authorized in rule 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) provides that a time for the making of motions shall be fixed at the time of the arraignment or as soon thereafter as practicable by court rule or direction of a judge. The rule leaves to the individual judge whether the motions may be oral or written. This and other amendments to rule 12 are designed to make possible and to encourage the making of motions prior to trial, whenever possible, and in a single hearing rather than in a series of hearings. This is the recommendation of the American Bar Association's Committee on Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial (Approved Draft, 1970); see especially &sect;&sect;5.2 and 5.3. It also is the procedure followed in those jurisdictions which have used the so-called &ldquo;omnibus hearing&rdquo; originated by Judge James Carter in the Southern District of California. See 4 Defender Newsletter 44 (1967); Miller, The Omnibus Hearing&mdash;An Experiment in Federal Criminal Discovery, 5 San Diego L.Rev. 293 (1968); American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial, Appendices B, C, and D (Approved Draft, 1970). The omnibus hearing is also being used, on an experimental basis, in several other district courts. Although the Advisory Committee is of the view that it would be premature to write the omnibus hearing procedure into the rules, it is of the view that the single pretrial hearing should be made possible and its use encouraged by the rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is a similar trend in state practice. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Goodchild v. Burke</em>, 27 Wis.2d 244, 133 N.W.2d 753 (1965); <em>State ex rel. Rasmussen v. Tahash</em>, 272 Minn. 539, 141 N.W.2d 3 (1965).</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule provides that the motion date be set at &ldquo;the arraignment or as soon thereafter as practicable.&rdquo; This is the practice in some federal courts including those using the omnibus hearing. (In order to obtain the advantage of the omnibus hearing, counsel routinely plead not guilty at the initial arraignment on the information or indictment and then may indicate a desire to change the plea to guilty following the omnibus hearing. This practice builds a more adequate record in guilty plea cases.) The rule further provides that the date may be set before the arraignment if local rules of court so provide.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) provides a mechanism for insuring that a defendant knows of the government's intention to use evidence to which the defendant may want to object. On some occasions the resolution of the admissibility issue prior to trial may be advantageous to the government. In these situations the attorney for the government can make effective defendant's obligation to make his motion to suppress prior to trial by giving defendant notice of the government's intention to use certain evidence. For example, in United States v. Desist, 384 F.2d 889, 897 (2d Cir. 1967), the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body">Early in the pre-trial proceedings, the Government commendably informed both the court and defense counsel that an electronic listening device had been used in investigating the case, and suggested a hearing be held as to its legality.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also the &ldquo;Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968,&rdquo; 18 U.S.C. &sect;2518(9):</p>
<p class="note-body">The contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in a Federal or State court unless each party, not less than ten days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, has been furnished with a copy of the court order, and accompanying application, under which the interception was authorized or approved.</p>
<p class="note-body">In cases in which defendant wishes to know what types of evidence the government intends to use so that he can make his motion to suppress prior to trial, he can request the government to give notice of its intention to use specified evidence which the defendant is entitled to discover under rule 16. Although the defendant is already entitled to discovery of such evidence prior to trial under rule 16, rule 12 makes it possible for him to avoid the necessity of moving to suppress evidence which the government does not intend to use. No sanction is provided for the government's failure to comply with the court's order because the committee believes that attorneys for the government will in fact comply and that judges have ways of insuring compliance. An automatic exclusion of such evidence, particularly where the failure to give notice was not deliberate, seems to create too heavy a burden upon the exclusionary rule of evidence, especially when defendant has opportunity for broad discovery under rule 16. Compare ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Electronic Surveillance (Approved Draft, 1971) at p. 116:</p>
<p class="note-body">A failure to comply with the duty of giving notice could lead to the suppression of evidence. Nevertheless, the standards make it explicit that the rule is intended to be a matter of procedure which need not under appropriate circumstances automatically dictate that evidence otherwise admissible be suppressed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pretrial notice by the prosecution of its intention to use evidence which may be subject to a motion to suppress is increasingly being encouraged in state practice. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Goodchild v. Burke</em>, 27 Wis.2d 244, 264, 133 N.W.2d 753, 763 (1965):</p>
<p class="note-body">In the interest of better administration of criminal justice we suggest that wherever practicable the prosecutor should within a reasonable time before trial notify the defense as to whether any alleged confession or admission will be offered in evidence at the trial. We also suggest, in cases where such notice is given by the prosecution, that the defense, if it intends to attack the confession or admission as involuntary, notify the prosecutor of a desire by the defense for a special determination on such issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also <em>State ex rel. Rasmussen v. Tahash</em>, 272 Minn. 539, 553&ndash;556, 141 N.W.2d 3, 13&ndash;15 (1965):</p>
<p class="note-body">At the time of arraignment when a defendant pleads not guilty, or as soon as possible thereafter, the state will advise the court as to whether its case against the defendant will include evidence obtained as the result of a search and seizure; evidence discovered because of a confession or statements in the nature of a confession obtained from the defendant; or confessions or statements in the nature of confessions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Upon being so informed, the court will formally advise the attorney for the defendant (or the defendant himself if he refuses legal counsel) that he may, if he chooses, move the court to suppress the evidence so secured or the confession so obtained if his contention is that such evidence was secured or confession obtained in violation of defendant's constitutional rights. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedure which we have outlined deals only with evidence obtained as the result of a search and seizure and evidence consisting of or produced by confession on the part of the defendant. However, the steps which have been suggested as a method of dealing with evidence of this type will indicate to counsel and to the trial courts that the pretrial consideration of other evidentiary problems, the resolution of which is needed to assure the integrity of the trial when conducted, will be most useful and that this court encourages the use of such procedures whenever practical.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) provides that the court shall rule on a pretrial motion before trial unless the court orders <!-- PDFPage:55 -->that it be decided upon at the trial of the general issue or after verdict. This is the old rule. The reference to issues which must be tried by the jury is dropped as unnecessary, without any intention of changing current law or practice. The old rule begs the question of when a jury decision is required at the trial, providing only that a jury is necessary if &ldquo;required by the Constitution or an act of Congress.&rdquo; It will be observed that subdivision (e) confers general authority to defer the determination of any pretrial motion until after verdict. However, in the case of a motion to suppress evidence the power should be exercised in the light of the possibility that if the motion is ultimately granted a retrial of the defendant may not be permissible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f) provides that a failure to raise the objections or make the requests specified in subdivision (b) constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court is allowed to grant relief from the waiver if adequate cause is shown. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;192 (1969), where it is pointed out that the old rule is unclear as to whether the waiver results only from a failure to raise the issue prior to trial or from the failure to do so at the time fixed by the judge for a hearing. The amendment makes clear that the defendant and, where appropriate, the government have an obligation to raise the issue at the motion date set by the judge pursuant to subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g) requires that a verbatim record be made of pretrial motion proceedings and requires the judge to make a record of his findings of fact and conclusions of law. This is desirable if pretrial rulings are to be subject to post-conviction review on the record. The judge may find and rule orally from the bench, so long as a verbatim record is taken. There is no necessity of a separate written memorandum containing the judge's findings and conclusions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (h) is essentially old rule 12(b)(5) except for the deletion of the provision that defendant may plead if the motion is determined adversely to him or, if he has already entered a plea, that that plea stands. This language seems unnecessary particularly in light of the experience in some district courts where a pro forma plea of not guilty is entered at the arraignment, pretrial motions are later made, and depending upon the outcome the defendant may then change his plea to guilty or persist in his plea of not guilty.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with pretrial motions and pleadings. The Supreme Court proposed several amendments to it. The more significant of these are set out below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) as proposed to be amended provides that the pretrial motions may be oral or written, at the court's discretion. It also provides that certain types of motions must be made before trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) as proposed to be amended provides that the government, either on its own or in response to a request by the defendant, must notify the defendant of its intention to use certain evidence in order to give the defendant an opportunity before trial to move to suppress that evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) as proposed to be amended permits the court to defer ruling on a pretrial motion until the trial of the general issue or until after verdict.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f) as proposed to be amended provides that the failure before trial to file motions or requests or to raise defenses which must be filed or raised prior to trial, results in a waiver. However, it also provides that the court, for cause shown, may grant relief from the waiver.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g) as proposed to be amended requires that a verbatim record be made of the pretrial motion proceedings and that the judge make a record of his findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee modified subdivision (e) to permit the court to defer its ruling on a pretrial motion until after the trial only for good cause. Moreover, the court cannot defer its ruling if to do so will adversely affect a party's right to appeal. The Committee believes that the rule proposed by the Supreme Court could deprive the government of its appeal rights under statutes like section 3731 of title 18 of the United States Code. Further, the Committee hopes to discourage the tendency to reserve rulings on pretrial motions until after verdict in the hope that the jury's verdict will make a ruling unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee also modified subdivision (h), which deals with what happens when the court grants a pretrial motion based upon a defect in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment or information. The Committee's change provides that when such a motion is granted, the court may order that the defendant be continued in custody or that his bail be continued for a specified time. A defendant should not automatically be continued in custody when such a motion is granted. In order to continue the defendant in custody, the court must not only determine that there is probable cause, but it must also determine, in effect, that there is good cause to have the defendant arrested.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (i). As noted in the recent decision of <em>United States v. Raddatz</em>, 447 U.S. 667 (1980), hearings on pretrial suppression motions not infrequently necessitate a determination of the credibility of witnesses. In such a situation, it is particularly important, as also highlighted by <em>Raddatz</em>, that the record include some other evidence which tends to either verify or controvert the assertions of the witness. (This is especially true in light of the <em>Raddatz</em> holding that a district judge, in order to make an independent evaluation of credibility, is not required to rehear testimony on which a magistrate based his findings and recommendations following a suppression hearing before the magistrate.) One kind of evidence which can often fulfill this function is prior statements of the testifying witness, yet courts have consistently held that in light of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500, such production of statements cannot be compelled at a pretrial suppression hearing. <em>United States v. Spagnuolo</em>, 515 F.2d 818 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Sebastian</em>, 497 F.2d 1267 (2nd Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Montos</em>, 421 F.2d 215 (5th Cir. 1970). This result, which finds no express Congressional approval in the legislative history of the Jencks Act, see <em>United States v. Sebastian</em>, supra; <em>United States v. Covello</em>, 410 F.2d 536 (2d Cir. 1969), would be obviated by new subdivision (i) of rule 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">This change will enhance the accuracy of the factual determinations made in the context of pretrial suppression hearings. As noted in <em>United States v. Sebastian</em>, supra, it can be argued</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;most persuasively that the case for pre-trial disclosure is strongest in the framework of a suppression hearing. Since findings at such a hearing as to admissibility of challenged evidence will often determine the result at trial and, at least in the case of fourth amendment suppression motions, cannot be relitigated later before the trier of fact, pre-trial production of the statements of witnesses would aid defense counsel's impeachment efforts at perhaps the most crucial point in the case. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [A] government witness at the suppression hearing may not appear at trial so that defendants could never test his credibility with the benefits of Jencks Act material.</p>
<p class="note-body">The latter statement is certainly correct, for not infrequently a police officer who must testify on a motion to suppress as to the circumstances of an arrest or search will not be called at trial because he has no information necessary to the determination of defendant's guilt. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Spagnuolo</em>, supra (dissent notes that &ldquo;under the prosecution's own admission, it did not intend to produce at trial the witnesses called at the pre-trial suppression hearing&rdquo;). Moreover, even if that person did testify at the trial, if that testimony went to a different subject matter, then <!-- PDFPage:56 -->under rule 26.2(c) only portions of prior statements covering the same subject matter need be produced, and thus portions which might contradict the suppression hearing testimony would not be revealed. Thus, while it may be true, as declared in <em>United States v. Montos</em>, supra, that &ldquo;due process does not require premature production at pre-trial hearings on motions to suppress of statements ultimately subject to discovery under the Jencks Act,&rdquo; the fact of the matter is that those statements&mdash;or, the essential portions thereof&mdash;are not necessarily subject to later discovery.</p>
<p class="note-body">Moreover, it is not correct to assume that somehow the problem can be solved by leaving the suppression issue &ldquo;open&rdquo; in some fashion for resolution once the trial is under way, at which time the prior statements will be produced. In <em>United States v. Spagnuolo</em>, supra, the court responded to the defendant's dilemma of inaccessible prior statements by saying that the suppression motion could simply be deferred until trial. But, under the current version of rule 12 this is not possible; subdivision (b) declares that motions to suppress &ldquo;must&rdquo; be made before trial, and subdivision (e) says such motions cannot be deferred for determination at trial &ldquo;if a party's right to appeal is adversely affected,&rdquo; which surely is the case as to suppression motions. As for the possibility of the trial judge reconsidering the motion to suppress on the basis of prior statements produced at trial and casting doubt on the credibility of a suppression hearing witness, it is not a desirable or adequate solution. For one thing, as already noted, there is no assurance that the prior statements will be forthcoming. Even if they are, it is not efficient to delay the continuation of the trial to undertake a reconsideration of matters which could have been resolved in advance of trial had the critical facts then been available. Furthermore, if such reconsideration is regularly to be expected of the trial judge, then this would give rise on appeal to unnecessary issues of the kind which confronted the court in <em>United States v. Montos</em>, supra&mdash;whether the trial judge was obligated either to conduct a new hearing or to make a new determination in light of the new evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of subdivision (i) provides that a law enforcement officer is to be deemed a witness called by the government. This means that when such a federal, state or local officer has testified at a suppression hearing, the defendant will be entitled to any statement of the officer in the possession of the government and relating to the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified, without regard to whether the officer was in fact called by the government or the defendant. There is considerable variation in local practice as to whether the arresting or searching officer is considered the witness of the defendant or of the government, but the need for the prior statement exists in either instance.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of subdivision (i) also provides that upon a claim of privilege the court is to excise the privileged matter before turning over the statement. The situation most likely to arise is that in which the prior statement of the testifying officer identifies an informant who supplied some or all of the probable cause information to the police. Under <em>McCray v. Illinois</em>, 386 U.S. 300 (1967), it is for the judge who hears the motion to decide whether disclosure of the informant's identity is necessary in the particular case. Of course, the government in any case may prevent disclosure of the informant's identity by terminating reliance upon information from that informant.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (i) is one of a series of contemporaneous amendments to Rules 26.2, 32(f), 32.1, 46, and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing &sect;2255 Hearings, which extended Rule 26.2, Production of Witness Statements, to other proceedings or hearings conducted under the Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 26.2(c) now explicitly states that the trial court may excise privileged matter from the requested witness statements. That change rendered similar language in Rule 12(i) redundant.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.1 is new. See rule 87 of the United States District Court Rules for the District of Columbia for a somewhat comparable provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee has dealt with the issue of notice of alibi on several occasions over the course of the past three decades. In the Preliminary Draft of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 1943, and the Second Preliminary Draft, 1944, an alibi-notice rule was proposed. But the Advisory Committee was closely divided upon whether there should be a rule at all and, if there were to be a rule, what the form of the rule should be. Orfield, The Preliminary Draft of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 22 Texas L.Rev. 37, 57&ndash;58 (1943). The principal disagreement was whether the prosecutor or the defendant should initiate the process. The Second Preliminary Draft published in 1944 required the defendant to initiate the process by a motion to require the government to state with greater particularity the time and place it would rely on. Upon receipt of this information, defendant was required to give his notice of alibi. This formulation was &ldquo;vehemently objected&rdquo; to by five members of the committee (out of a total of eighteen) and two alternative rule proposals were submitted to the Supreme Court. Both formulations&mdash;one requiring the prosecutor to initiate the process, the other requiring the defendant to initiate the process&mdash;were rejected by the Court. See Epstein, Advance Notice of Alibi, 55 J.Crim.L., C. & P.S. 29, 30 (1964), in which the view is expressed that the unresolved split over the rule &ldquo;probably caused&rdquo; the court to reject an alibi-notice rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.1 embodies an intermediate position. The initial burden is upon the defendant to raise the defense of alibi, but he need not specify the details of his alibi defense until the government specifies the time, place, and date of alleged offense. Each party must, at the appropriate time, disclose the names and addresses of witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">In 1962 the Advisory Committee drafted an alibi-notice rule and included it in the Preliminary Draft of December 1962, rule 12A at pp. 5&ndash;6. This time the Advisory Committee withdrew the rule without submitting it to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure. Wright, Proposed Changes in Federal Civil, Criminal, and Appellate Procedure, 35 F.R.D. 317, 326 (1964). Criticism of the December 1962 alibi-notice rule centered on constitutional questions and questions of general fairness to the defendant. See Everett, Discovery in Criminal Cases&mdash;In Search of a Standard, 1964 Duke L.J. 477, 497&ndash;499.</p>
<p class="note-body">Doubts about the constitutionality of a notice-of-alibi rule were to some extent resolved by <em>Williams v. Florida</em>, 399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970). In that case the court sustained the constitutionality of the Florida notice-of-alibi statute, but left unresolved two important questions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The court said that it was not holding that a notice-of-alibi requirement was valid under conditions where a defendant does not enjoy &ldquo;reciprocal discovery against the State.&rdquo; 399 U.S. at 82 n. 11, 90 S.Ct. 1893. Under the revision of rule 16, the defendant is entitled to substantially enlarged discovery in federal cases, and it would seem appropriate to conclude that the rules will comply with the &ldquo;reciprocal discovery&rdquo; qualification of the <em>Williams</em> decision. [See, <em>Wardius v. Oregon</em>, 412 U.S. 470, 93 S.Ct. 2208, 37 L.Ed.2d 82 (1973) was decided after the approval of proposed Rule 12.1 by the Judicial Conference of the United States. In that case the Court held the Oregon Notice-of-Alibi statute unconstitutional because of the failure to give the defendant adequate reciprocal discovery rights.]</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The court said that it did not consider the question of the &ldquo;validity of the threatened sanction, had petitioner chosen not to comply with the notice-of-alibi rule.&rdquo; 399 U.S. at 83 n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1893. This issue remains unresolved. [See <em>Wardius v. Oregon</em>, 412 U.S. at 472, Note 4, 93 S.Ct. 2208.] Rule 12.1(e) provides that the court may exclude the testimony of any witness whose name has not been disclosed pursuant to the requirements of the rule. The defendant may, however, testify himself. Prohibiting from testifying a witness whose name was not disclosed is a common provision in state statutes. See Epstein, <em>supra</em>, at 35. It is generally assumed that the sanction is essential if the notice-of-alibi rule is to have practical significance. See Epstein, <em>supra</em>, at 36. The use of the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; is intended to make clear that the judge may allow the alibi witness to testify if, under the particular circumstances, there is cause shown for the failure to conform to the requirements of the rules. This is further emphasized by subdivision (f) which provides for exceptions whenever &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; is shown for the exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court of Illinois recently upheld an Illinois statute which requires a defendant to give notice of his alibi witnesses although the prosecution is not required to disclose its alibi rebuttal witnesses. <em>People v. Holiday</em>, 47 Ill.2d 300, 265 N.E.2d 634 (1970). Because the defense complied with the requirement, the court did not have to consider the propriety of penalizing noncompliance.</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement of notice of alibi seems to be an increasingly common requirement of state criminal procedure. State statutes and court rules are cited in 399 U.S. at 82 n. 11, 90 S.Ct. 1893. See also Epstein, <em>supra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.1 will serve a useful purpose even though rule 16 now requires disclosure of the names and addresses of government and defense witnesses. There are cases in which the identity of defense witnesses may be known, but it may come as a surprise to the government that they intend to testify as to an alibi and there may be no advance notice of the details of the claimed alibi. The result often is an unnecessary interruption and delay in the trial to enable the government to conduct an appropriate investigation. The objective of rule 12.1 is to prevent this by providing a mechanism which will enable the parties to have specific information in advance of trial to prepare to meet the issue of alibi during the trial.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 12.1 is a new rule that deals with the defense of alibi. It provides that a defendant must notify the government of his intention to rely upon the defense of alibi. Upon receipt of such notice, the government must advise the defendant of the specific time, date, and place at which the offense is alleged to have been committed. The defendant must then inform the government of the specific place at which he claims to have been when the offense is alleged to have been committed, and of the names and addresses of the witnesses on <!-- PDFPage:58 -->whom he intends to rely to establish his alibi. The government must then inform the defendant of the names and addresses of the witnesses on whom it will rely to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the crime. If either party fails to comply with the provisions of the rule, the court may exclude the testimony of any witness whose identity is not disclosed. The rule does not attempt to limit the right of the defendant to testify in his own behalf.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee disagrees with the defendant-triggered procedures of the rule proposed by the Supreme Court. The major purpose of a notice-of-alibi rule is to prevent unfair surprise to the prosecution. The Committee, therefore, believes that it should be up to the prosecution to trigger the alibi defense discovery procedures. If the prosecution is worried about being surprised by an alibi defense, it can trigger the alibi defense discovery procedures. If the government fails to trigger the procedures and if the defendant raises an alibi defense at trial, then the government cannot claim surprise and get a continuance of the trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee has adopted a notice-of-alibi rule similar to the one now used in the District of Columbia. [See Rule 2&ndash;5(b) of the Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See also Rule 16&ndash;1 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.] The rule is prosecution-triggered. If the prosecutor notifies the defendant of the time, place, and date of the alleged offense, then the defendant has 10 days in which to notify the prosecutor of his intention to rely upon an alibi defense, specify where he claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense, and provide a list of his alibi witnesses. The prosecutor, within 10 days but no later than 10 days before trial, must then provide the defendant with a list of witnesses who will place the defendant at the scene of the alleged crime and those witnesses who will be used to rebut the defendant's alibi witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee's rule does not operate only to the benefit of the prosecution. In fact, its rule will provide the defendant with more information than the rule proposed by the Supreme Court. The rule proposed by the Supreme Court permits the defendant to obtain a list of only those witnesses who will place him at the scene of the crime. The defendant, however, would get the names of these witnesses anyway as part of his discovery under Rule 16(a)(1)(E). The Committee rule not only requires the prosecution to provide the names of witnesses who place the defendant at the scene of the crime, but it also requires the prosecution to turn over the names of those witnesses who will be called in rebuttal to the defendant's alibi witnesses. This is information that the defendant is not otherwise entitled to discover.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). This clarifying amendment is intended to serve the same purpose as a comparable change made in 1979 to similar language in Rule 11(e)(6). The change makes it clear that evidence of a withdrawn intent or of statements made in connection therewith is thereafter inadmissible against the person who gave the notice in any civil or criminal proceeding, without regard to whether the proceeding is against that person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.2 is designed to require a defendant to give notice prior to trial of his intention (1) to rely upon the <!-- PDFPage:59 -->defense of insanity or (2) to introduce expert testimony of mental disease or defect on the theory that such mental condition is inconsistent with the mental state required for the offense charged. This rule does not deal with the issue of mental competency to stand trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The objective is to give the government time to prepare to meet the issue, which will usually require reliance upon expert testimony. Failure to give advance notice commonly results in the necessity for a continuance in the middle of a trial, thus unnecessarily delaying the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">A requirement that the defendant give notice of his intention to rely upon the defense of insanity was proposed by the Advisory Committee in the Second Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments (March 1964), rule 12.1, p. 7. The objective of the 1964 proposal was explained in a brief Advisory Committee Note:</p>
<p class="note-body">Under existing procedure although insanity is a defense, once it is raised the burden to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the government. <em>Davis v. United States</em>, 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895). This rule requires pretrial notice to the government of an insanity defense, thus permitting it to prepare to meet the issue. Furthermore, in <em>Lynch v. Overholser</em>, 369 U.S. 705, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962), the Supreme Court held that, at least in the face of a mandatory commitment statute, the defendant had a right to determine whether or not to raise the issue of insanity. The rule gives the defendant a method of raising the issue and precludes any problem of deciding whether or not the defendant relied on insanity.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure decided not to recommend the proposed Notice of Insanity rule to the Supreme Court. Reasons were not given.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring advance notice of the defense of insanity is commonly recommended as a desirable procedure. The Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, Vol. 1, p. 254 (1970), state in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">It is recommended that procedural reform provide for advance notice that evidence of mental disease or defect will be relied upon in defense.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring advance notice is proposed also by the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, &sect;4.03 (P.O.D. 1962). The commentary in Tentative Draft No. 4 at 193&ndash;194 (1955) indicates that, as of that time, six states required pretrial notice and an additional eight states required that the defense of insanity be specially pleaded.</p>
<p class="note-body">For recent state statutes see N.Y. CPL &sect;250.10 (McKinney's Consol. Laws, c. 11&ndash;A, 1971) enacted in 1970 which provides that no evidence by a defendant of a mental disease negativing criminal responsibility shall be allowed unless defendant has served notice on the prosecutor of his intention to rely upon such defense. See also New Jersey Penal Code (Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, Oct. 1971) &sect;2c: 4&ndash;3; New Jersey Court Rule 3:12; <em>State v. Whitlow</em>, 45 N.J. 3, 22 n. 3, 210 T.2d 763 (1965), holding the requirement of notice to be both appropriate and not in violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) deals with notice of the &ldquo;defense of insanity.&rdquo; In this context the term insanity has a well-understood meaning. See, e.g., Tydings, A Federal Verdict of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity and a Subsequent Commitment Procedure, 27 Md.L.Rev. 131 (1967). Precisely how the defense of insanity is phrased does, however, differ somewhat from circuit to circuit. See Study Draft of a New Federal Criminal Code, &sect;503 Comment at 37 (USGPO 1970). For a more extensive discussion of present law, see Working Papers of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, Vol. 1, pp. 229&ndash;247 (USGPO 1970). The National Commission recommends the adoption of a single test patterned after the proposal of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code. The proposed definition provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">In any prosecution for an offense lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect is a defense. [Study Draft of a New Federal Criminal Code &sect;503 at 36&ndash;37.]</p>
<p class="note-body">Should the proposal of the National Commission be adopted by the Congress, the language of subdivision (a) probably ought to be changed to read &ldquo;defense of lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;defense of insanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is intended to deal with the issue of expert testimony bearing upon the issue of whether the defendant had the &ldquo;mental state required for the offense charged.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">There is some disagreement as to whether it is proper to introduce evidence of mental disease or defect bearing not upon the defense of insanity, but rather upon the existence of the mental state required by the offense charged. The American Law Institute's Model Penal Code takes the position that such evidence is admissible [&sect;4.02(1) (P.O.D. 1962)]. See also <em>People v. Gorshen</em>, 51 Cal.2d 716, 336 P.2d 492 (1959).</p>
<p class="note-body">The federal cases reach conflicting conclusions. See <em>Rhodes v. United States</em>, 282 F.2d 59, 62 (4th Cir. 1960):</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The proper way would have been to ask the witness to describe the defendant's mental condition and symptoms, his pathological beliefs and motivations, if he was thus afflicted, and to explain how these influenced or could have influenced his behavior, particularly his mental capacity knowingly to make the false statement charged, or knowingly to forge the signatures *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Compare <em>Fisher v. United States</em>, 328 U.S. 463, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382 (1946).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) does not attempt to decide when expert testimony is admissible on the issue of the requisite mental state. It provides only that the defendant must give pretrial notice when he intends to introduce such evidence. The purpose is to prevent the need for a continuance when such evidence is offered without prior notice. The problem of unnecessary delay has arisen in jurisdictions which do not require prior notice of an intention to use expert testimony on the issue of mental state. Referring to this, the California Special Commission on Insanity and Criminal Offenders, First Report 30 (1962) said:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The abuses of the present system are great. Under a plea of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; without any notice to the people that the defense of insanity will be relied upon, defendant has been able to raise the defense upon the trial of the issue as to whether he committed the offense charged.</p>
<p class="note-body">As an example of the delay occasioned by the failure to heretofore require a pretrial notice by the defendant, see <em>United States v. Albright</em>, 388 F.2d 719 (4th Cir. 1968), where a jury trial was recessed for 23 days to permit a psychiatric examination by the prosecution when the defendant injected a surprise defense of lack of mental competency.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) gives the court the authority to order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by a psychiatrist designated by the court. A similar provision is found in ALI, Model Penal Code &sect;4.05(1) (P.O.D. 1962). This is a common provision of state law, the constitutionality of which has been sustained. Authorities are collected in ALI, Model Penal Code, pp. 195&ndash;196 Tent. Draft No. 4, (1955). For a recent proposal, see the New Jersey Penal Code &sect;2c: 4&ndash;5 (Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, Oct. 1971) authorizing appointment of &ldquo;at least one qualified psychiatrist to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant.&rdquo; Any issue of self-incrimination which might arise can be dealt with by the court as, for example, by a bifurcated trial which deals separately with the issues of guilt and of mental responsibility. For statutory authority to appoint a psychiatrist with respect to competency to stand trial, see 18 U.S.C. &sect;4244.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) confers authority on the court to exclude expert testimony in behalf of a defendant who has failed to give notice under subdivision (b) or who refuses to be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist under subdivision (c). See <em>State v. Whitlow</em>, 45 N.J. 3, 23, <!-- PDFPage:60 -->210 A.2d 763 (1965), which indicates that it is proper to limit or exclude testimony by a defense psychiatrist whenever defendant refuses to be examined.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 12.2 is a new rule that deals with defense based upon mental condition. It provides that: (1) The defendant must notify the prosecution in writing of his intention to rely upon the defense of insanity. If the defendant fails to comply, &ldquo;insanity may not be raised as a defense.&rdquo; (2) If the defendant intends to introduce expert testimony relating to mental disease or defect on the issue whether he had the requisite mental state, he must notify the prosecution in writing. (3) The court, on motion of the prosecution, may order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by a court-appointed psychiatrist. (4) If the defendant fails to undergo the court-ordered psychiatric examination, the court may exclude any expert witness the defendant offers on the issue of his mental state.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee agrees with the proposed rule but has added language concerning the use of statements made to a psychiatrist during the course of a psychiatric examination provided for by Rule 12.2. The language provides:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">No statement made by the accused in the course of any examination provided for by this rule, whether the examination shall be with or without the consent of the accused, shall be admitted in evidence against the accused before the judge who or jury which determines the guilt of the accused, prior to the determination of guilt.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The purpose of this rule is to secure the defendant's fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. See <em>State v. Raskin</em>, 34 Wis.2d 607, 150 N.W.2d 318 (1967). The provision is flexible and does not totally preclude the use of such statements. For example, the defendant's statement can be used at a separate determination of the issue of sanity or for sentencing purposes once guilt has been determined. A limiting instruction to the jury in a single trial to consider statements made to the psychiatrist only on the issue of sanity would not satisfy the requirements of the rule as amended. The prejudicial effect on the determination of guilt would be inescapable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee notes that the rule does not attempt to resolve the issue whether the court can constitutionally compel a defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination when the defendant is unwilling to undergo one. The provisions of subdivision (c) are qualified by the phrase, &ldquo;In an appropriate case.&rdquo; If the court cannot constitutionally compel an unwilling defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination, then the provisions of subdivision (c) are inapplicable in every instance where the defendant is unwilling to undergo a court-ordered psychiatric examination. The Committee, by its approval of subdivision (c), intends to take no stand whatever on the constitutional question.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Conference Committee Notes, House Report No. 94&ndash;414; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 12.2(c) deals with court-ordered psychiatric examinations. The House version provides that no statement made by a defendant during a court-ordered psychiatric examination could be admitted in evidence against the defendant before the trier of fact that determines the issue of guilt prior to the determination of guilt. The Senate version deletes this provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts a modified House provision and restores to the bill the language of H.R. 6799 as it was originally introduced. The Conference adopted language provides that no statement made by the defendant during a psychiatric examination provided for by the rule shall be admitted against him on the issue of guilt in any criminal proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference believes that the provision in H.R. 6799 as originally introduced in the House adequately protects the defendant's fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. The rule does not preclude use of statements made by a defendant during a court-ordered psychiatric examination. The statements may be relevant to the issue of defendant's sanity and admissible on that issue. However, a limiting instruction would not satisfy the rule if a statement is so prejudicial that a limiting instruction would be ineffective. Cf. practice under 18 U.S.C. 4244.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). Courts have recently experienced difficulty with the question of what kind of expert testimony offered for what purpose falls within the notice requirement of rule 12.2(b). See, e.g., <em>United States v. Hill</em>, 655 F.2d 512 (3d Cir. 1980) (rule not applicable to tendered testimony of psychologist concerning defendant's susceptibility of inducement, offered to reinforce defendant's entrapment defense); <em>United States v. Webb</em>, 625 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. 1980) (rule not applicable to expert testimony tendered to show that defendant lacked the &ldquo;propensity to commit a violent act,&rdquo; as this testimony was offered &ldquo;to prove that Webb did not commit the offense charged,&rdquo; shooting at a helicopter, &ldquo;not that certain conduct was unaccompanied by criminal intent&rdquo;); <em>United States v. Perl</em>, 584 F.2d 1316 (4th Cir. 1978) (because entrapment defense properly withheld from jury, it was unnecessary to decide if the district court erred in holding rule applicable to tendered testimony of the doctor that defendant had increased susceptibility to suggestion as a result of medication he was taking); <em>United States v. Olson</em>, 576 F.2d 1267 (8th Cir. 1978) (rule applicable to tendered testimony of an alcoholism and drug therapist that defendant was not responsible for his actions because of a problem with alcohol); <em>United States v. Staggs</em>, 553 F.2d 1073 (7th Cir. 1977) (rule applicable to tendered testimony of psychologist that defendant, charged with assaulting federal officer, was more likely to hurt himself than to direct his aggressions toward others, as this testimony bears upon whether defendant intended to put victim in apprehension when he picked up the gun).</p>
<p class="note-body">What these cases illustate is that expert testimony about defendant's mental condition may be tendered in a wide variety of circumstances well beyond the situation clearly within rule 12.2(b), i.e., where a psychiatrist testifies for the defendant regarding his diminished capacity. In all of these situations and others like them, there is good reason to make applicable the notice provisions of rule 12.2(b). This is because in all circumstances in which the defendant plans to offer expert testimony concerning his mental condition at the time of the crime charged, advance disclosure to the government will serve &ldquo;to permit adequate pretrial preparation, to prevent surprise at trial, and to avoid the necessity of delays during trial.&rdquo; 2 <em>A.B.A. Standards for Criminal Justice</em> 11&ndash;55 (2d 1980). Thus, while the district court in <em>United States v. Hill</em>, 481 F.Supp. 558 (E.D.Pa. 1979), incorrectly concluded that present rule 12.2(b) covers testimony by a psychologist bearing on the defense of entrapment, the court quite properly concluded that the government would be seriously disadvantaged by lack of notice. This would have meant that the government would not have been equipped to cross-examine the expert, that any expert called by the government would not have had an opportunity to hear the defense expert testify, and that the government would not have had an opportunity to conduct the kind of investigation needed to acquire rebuttal testimony on defendant's claim that he was especially susceptible to inducement. Consequently, rule 12.2(b) has been expanded to cover all of the aforementioned situations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). The amendment of the first sentence of subdivision (c), recognizing that the government may seek to have defendant subjected to a mental examination by an expert other than a psychiatrist, is prompted by the same considerations discussed above. Because it is possible that the defendant will submit to examination by an expert of his own other <!-- PDFPage:61 -->than a psychiatrist, it is necessary to recognize that it will sometimes be appropriate for defendant to be examined by a government expert other than a psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (c) has been amended to more accurately reflect the Fifth Amendment considerations at play in this context. See <em>Estelle v. Smith</em>, 451 U.S. 454 (1981), holding that self-incrimination protections are not inevitably limited to the guilt phase of a trial and that the privilege, when applicable, protects against use of defendant's statement and also the fruits thereof, including expert testimony based upon defendant's statements to the expert. <em>Estelle</em> also intimates that &ldquo;a defendant can be required to submit to a sanity examination,&rdquo; and presumably some other form of mental examination, when &ldquo;his silence may deprive the State of the only effective means it has of controverting his proof on an issue that he interjected into the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). The broader term &ldquo;mental condition&rdquo; is appropriate here in light of the above changes to subdivisions (b) and (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). New subdivision (e), generally consistent with the protection afforded in rule 12.1(f) with respect to notice of alibi, ensures that the notice required under subdivision (b) will not deprive the defendant of an opportunity later to elect not to utilize any expert testimony. This provision is consistent with <em>Williams v. Florida</em>, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), holding the privilege against self-incrimination is not violated by requiring the defendant to give notice of a defense where the defendant retains the &ldquo;unfettered choice&rdquo; of abandoning the defense.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Dissenting Statement of Justice O'Connor to 1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">With one minor reservation, I join the Court in its adoption of the proposed amendments. They represent the product of considerable effort by the Advisory Committee, and they will institute desirable reforms. My sole disagreement with the Court's action today lies in its failure to recommend correction of an apparent error in the drafting of Proposed Rule 12.2(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">As proposed, Rule 12.2(e) reads:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Evidence of an intention as to which notice was given under subdivision (a) or (b), later withdrawn, is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who gave notice of the intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Identical language formerly appeared in Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 11(e)(6) and Fed. Rules Evid. 410, each of which stated that</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;[Certain material] is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the defendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Those rules were amended, Supreme Court Order April 30, 1979, 441 U.S. 970, 987, 1007, Pub. Law 96&ndash;42, approved July 31, 1979, 93 Stat. 326. After the amendments, the relevant language read,</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;[Certain material] is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">As the Advisory Committee explained, this minor change was necessary to eliminate an ambiguity. Before the amendment, the word &ldquo;against&rdquo; could be read as referring either to the kind of proceeding in which the evidence was offered or to the purpose for which it was offered. Thus, for instance, if a person was a witness in a suit but not a party, it was unclear whether the evidence could be used to impeach him. In such a case, the <em>use</em> would be against the person, but the <em>proceeding</em> would not be against him. Similarly, if the person wished to introduce the evidence in a proceeding in which he was the defendant, the use, but not the proceeding, would be against him. To eliminate the ambiguity, the Advisory Committee proposed the amendment clarifying that the evidence was inadmissible against the person, regardless of whether the particular proceeding was against the person. See Adv. Comm. Note to Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 11(e)(6); Adv. Comm. Note to Fed. Rules Evid. 410.</p>
<p class="note-body">The same ambiguity inheres in the proposed version of Rule 12.2(e). We should recommend that it be eliminated now. To that extent, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). This clarifying amendment is intended to serve the same purpose as a comparable change made in 1979 to similar language in Rule 11(e)(6). The change makes it clear that evidence of a withdrawn intent is thereafter inadmissible against the person who gave the notice in any civil or criminal proceeding, without regard to whether the proceeding is against that person.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 14. Relief From Prejudicial Joinder</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment or information or by such joinder for trial together, the court may order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires. In ruling on a motion by a defendant for severance the court may order the attorney for the government to deliver to the court for inspection <em>in camera</em> any statements or confessions made by the defendants which the government intends to introduce in evidence at the trial.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">This rule is a restatement of existing law under which severance and other similar relief is entirely in the discretion of the court, 18 U.S.C. [former] 557 (Indictments and presentments; joinder of charges); <em>Pointer v. United States</em>, 151 U.S. 396; <em>Pierce v. United States</em>, 160 U.S. 355; <em>United States v. Ball</em>, 163 U.S. 662, 673; <em>Stilson v. United States</em>, 250 U.S. 583.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A defendant may be prejudiced by the admission in evidence against a co-defendant of a statement or confession made by that co-defendant. This prejudice cannot be dispelled by cross-examination if the co-defendant does not take the stand. Limiting instructions to the jury may not in fact erase the prejudice. While the question whether to grant a severance is generally left within the discretion of the trial court, recent Fifth Circuit cases have found sufficient prejudice involved to make denial of a motion for severance reversible error. See <em>Schaffer v. United States</em>, 221 F.2d 17 (5th Cir. 1955); <em>Barton v. United States</em>, 263 F.2d 894 (5th Cir. 1959). It has even been suggested that when the confession of the co-defendant comes as a surprise at the trial, it may be error to deny a motion or a mistrial. See <em>Belvin v. United States</em>, 273 F.2d 583 (5th Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="note-body">The purpose of the amendment is to provide a procedure whereby the issue of possible prejudice can be resolved on the motion for severance. The judge may direct the disclosure of the confessions or statements of <!-- PDFPage:63 -->the defendants to him for in camera inspection as an aid to determining whether the possible prejudice justifies ordering separate trials. Cf. note, Joint and Single Trials Under Rules 8 and 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 74 Yale L.J. 551, 565 (1965).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 15. Depositions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>When Taken</cap-smallcap>. Whenever due to exceptional circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved for use at trial, the court may upon motion of such party and notice to the parties order that testimony of such witness be taken by deposition and that any designated book, paper, document, record, recording, or other material not privileged, be produced at the same time and place. If a witness is detained pursuant to section 3144 of title 18, United States Code, the court on written motion of the witness and upon notice to the parties may direct that the witness&rsquo; deposition be taken. After the deposition has been subscribed the court may discharge the witness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Taking</cap-smallcap>. The party at whose instance a deposition is to be taken shall give to every party reasonable written notice of the time and place for taking the deposition. The notice shall state the name and address of each person to be examined. On motion of a party upon whom the notice is served, the court for cause shown may extend or shorten the time or change the place for taking the deposition. The officer having custody of a defendant shall be notified of the time and place set for the examination and shall, unless the defendant waives in writing the right to be present, produce the defendant at the examination and keep the defendant in the presence of the witness during the examination, unless, after being warned by the court that disruptive conduct will cause the defendant's removal from the place of the taking of the deposition, the defendant persists in conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from that place. A defendant not in custody shall have the right to be present at the examination upon request subject to such terms as may be fixed by the court, but a failure, absent good cause shown, to appear after notice and tender of expenses in accordance with subdivision (c) of this rule shall constitute a waiver of that right and of any objection to the taking and use of the deposition based upon that right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment of Expenses</cap-smallcap>. Whenever a deposition is taken at the instance of the government, or whenever a deposition is taken at the instance of a defendant who is unable to bear the expenses of the taking of the deposition, the court may direct that the expense of travel and subsistence of the defendant and the defendant's attorney for attendance at the examination and the cost of the transcript of the deposition shall be paid by the government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>How Taken</cap-smallcap>. Subject to such additional conditions as the court shall provide, a deposition shall be taken and filed in the manner provided in civil actions except as otherwise provided in these rules, provided that (1) in no event shall a deposition be taken of a party defendant without that defendant's consent, and (2) the scope and manner of examination and cross-examination shall be such as would be allowed in the trial itself. The government shall make available to the defendant or the defendant's counsel for examination and use at the taking of the deposition any statement of the witness being deposed which is in the possession of the government and to which the defendant would be entitled at the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Use</cap-smallcap>. At the trial or upon any hearing, a part or all of a deposition, so far as otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used as substantive evidence if the witness is unavailable, as unavailability is defined in Rule 804(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or the witness gives testimony at the trial or hearing inconsistent with that witness&rsquo; deposition. Any deposition may also be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness. If only a part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the offering of all of it which is relevant to the part offered and any party may offer other parts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Objections to Deposition Testimony</cap-smallcap>. Objections to deposition testimony or evidence or parts thereof and the grounds for the objection shall be stated at the time of the taking of the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Deposition by Agreement Not Precluded</cap-smallcap>. Nothing in this rule shall preclude the taking of a deposition, orally or upon written questions, or the use of a deposition, by agreement of the parties with the consent of the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. This rule continues the existing law permitting defendants to take depositions in certain limited classes of cases under <em>dedimus potestatem</em> and <em>in perpetuam rei memoriam</em>, 28 U.S.C. [former] 644. This statute has been generally held applicable to criminal cases, <em>Clymer v. United States</em>, 38 F.2d 581 (C.C.A. 10th); <em>Wong Yim v. United States</em>, 118 F.2d 667 (C.C.A. 9th)&mdash;cert. den., 313 U.S. 589; <em>United States v. Cameron</em>, 15 F. 794 (C.C.E.D.Mo.); <em>United States v. Hofmann</em>, 24 F.Supp. 847 (S.D.N.Y.). Contra, <em>Luxemberg v. United States</em>, 45 F.2d 497 (C.C.A. 4th)&mdash;cert. den., 283 U.S. 820. The rule continues the limitation of the statute that the taking of depositions is to be restricted to cases in which they are necessary &ldquo;in order to prevent a failure of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Unlike the practice in civil cases in which depositions may be taken as a matter of right by notice without permission of the court (Rules 26(a) and 30, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]), this rule permits depositions to be taken only by order of the court, made in the exercise of discretion and on notice to all parties. It was contemplated that in criminal cases depositions would be used only in exceptional situations, as has been the practice heretofore.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. This rule introduces a new feature in authorizing the taking of the deposition of a witness committed for failure to give bail (see Rule 46(b)). This matter is, however, left to the discretion of the court. The purpose of the rule is to afford a method of relief for such a witness, if the court finds it proper to extend it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This subdivision, as well as subdivisions (d) and (f), sets forth the procedure to be followed in the event that the court grants an order for the taking of a deposition. The procedure prescribed is similar to that in civil cases, Rules 28&ndash;31, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<!-- PDFPage:64 --><p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). This rule introduces a new feature for the purpose of protecting the rights of an indigent defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). See <em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b), <em>supra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). In providing when and for what purpose a deposition may be used at the trial, this rule generally follows the corresponding provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 26(d)(3) [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. The only difference is that in civil cases a deposition may be introduced at the trial if the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial, while this rule requires that the witness be out of the United States. The distinction results from the fact that a subpoena in a civil case runs only within the district where issued or 100 miles from the place of trial (Rule 45(e)(1), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), while a subpoena in a criminal case runs throughout the United States (see Rule 17(e)(1), <em>infra).</em></p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 15 authorizes the taking of depositions by the government. Under former rule 15 only a defendant was authorized to take a deposition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revision is similar to Title VI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The principal difference is that Title VI (18 U.S.C. &sect;3503) limits the authority of the government to take depositions to cases in which the Attorney General certifies that the &ldquo;proceeding is against a person who is believed to have participated in an organized criminal activity.&rdquo; This limitation is not contained in rule 15.</p>
<p class="note-body">Dealing with the issue of government depositions so soon after the enactment of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3503 is not inconsistent with the congressional purpose. On the floor of the House, Congressman Poff, a principal spokesman for the proposal, said that the House version was not designed to &ldquo;limit the Judicial Conference of the United States in the exercise of its rulemaking authority .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from addressing itself to other problems in this area or from adopting a broader approach.&rdquo; 116 Cong.Rec. 35293 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">The recently enacted Title VI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (18 U.S.C. &sect;3503) is based upon earlier efforts of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules which has over the past twenty-five years submitted several proposals authorizing government depositions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The earlier drafts of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure proposed that the government be allowed to take depositions. Orfield, The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 33 Calif.L.Rev. 543, 559 (1945). The Fifth Draft of what became rule 15 (then rule 20) dated June 1942, was submitted to the Supreme Court for comment. The court had a number of unfavorable comments about allowing government depositions. These comments were not published. The only reference to the fact that the court made comments is in 2 Orfield, Criminal Procedure under the Federal Rules &sect;15:1 (1966); and Orfield, Depositions in Federal Criminal Procedure, 9 S.C.L.Q. 376, 380&ndash;381 (1957).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee, in the 1940's, continued to recommend the adoption of a provision authorizing government depositions. The final draft submitted to the Supreme Court contained a section providing:</p>
<p class="note-body">The following additional requirements shall apply if the deposition is taken at the instance of the government or of a witness. The officer having custody of a defendant shall be notified of the time and place set for examination, and shall produce him at the examination and keep him in the presence of the witness during the examination. A defendant not in custody shall be given notice and shall have the right to be present at the examination. The government shall pay in advance to the defendant's attorney and a defendant not in custody expenses of travel and subsistence for attendance at the examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">See 2 Orfield, Criminal Procedure under the Federal Rules &sect;15:3, pp. 447&ndash;448 (1966); Orfield, Depositions in Federal Criminal Procedure, 9 S.C.L.Q. 376, 383 (1957).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court rejected this section in this entirety, thus eliminating the provision for depositions by the government. These changes were made without comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposal to allow government depositions was renewed in the amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in the early 1960's. The Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts (December 1962) proposed to amend rule 15 by eliminating the words &ldquo;of a defendant&rdquo; from the first sentence of subdivision (a) and adding a subdivision (g) which was practically identical to the subdivision rejected by the Supreme Court in the original draft of the rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Second Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts (March 1964) continued to propose allowing governments depositions. Subdivision (g) was substantially modified, however.</p>
<p class="note-body">The following additional requirements shall apply if the deposition is taken at the instance of the government or a witness. Both the defendant and his attorney shall be given reasonable advance notice of the time and place set for the examination. The officer having custody of a defendant shall be notified of the time and place set for the examination, and shall produce him at the examination and keep him in the presence of the witness during the examination. A defendant not in custody shall have the right to be present at the examination but his failure to appear after notice and tender of expenses shall constitute a waiver of that right. The government shall pay to the defendant's attorney and to a defendant not in custody expenses of travel and subsistence for attendance at the examination. The government shall make available to the defendant for his examination and use at the taking of the deposition any statement of the witness being deposed which is in the possession of the government and which the government would be required to make available to the defendant if the witness were testifying at the trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposal to authorize government depositions was rejected by the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure &sect;241 at 477 (1969). 4 Barron, Federal Practice and Procedure (Supp. 1967). The Report of the Judicial Conference, submitted to the Supreme Court for approval late in 1965, contained no proposal for an amendment to rule 15. See 39 F.R.D. 69, 168&ndash;211 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body">When the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 was originally introduced in the Senate (S. 30) it contained a government deposition provision which was similar to the 1964 proposal of the Criminal Rules Advisory Committee, except that the original bill (S. 30) failed to provide standards to control the use of depositions at the trial. For an explanation and defense of the original proposal see McClellan, The Organized Crime Act (S. 30) or Its Critics: Which Threatens Civil Liberties?, 46 Notre Dame Lawyer 55, 100&ndash;108 (1970). This omission was remedied, prior to passage, with the addition of what is now 18 U.S.C. &sect;3503(f) which prescribes the circumstances in which a deposition can be used. The standards are the same as those in former rule 15(e) with the addition of language allowing the use of the deposition when &ldquo;the witness refuses in the trial or hearing to testify concerning the subject of the deposition or the part offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Before the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 was enacted an additional amendment was added providing that the right of the government to take a deposition is limited to cases in which the Attorney General certifies that the defendant is &ldquo;believed to have participated in an organized criminal activity&rdquo; [18 U.S.C. &sect;3503(a)]. The argument in favor of the amendment was that the whole purpose of the act was to deal with organized crime and therefore its provisions, including that providing for government depositions, should be limited to organized crime type cases.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:65 --><p class="note-body">There is another aspect of Advisory Committee history which is relevant. In January 1970, the Advisory Committee circulated proposed changes in rule 16, one of which gives the government, when it has disclosed the identity of its witnesses, the right to take a deposition and use it &ldquo;in the event the witness has become unavailable without the fault of the government or if the witness has changed his testimony.&rdquo; [See Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts, rule 16(a)(1)(vi) (January 1970).] This provision is now incorporated within rule 16(a)(1)(v).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because neither the court nor the standing committee gave reasons for rejecting the government deposition proposal, it is not possible to know why they were not approved. To the extent that the rejection was based upon doubts as to the constitutionality of such a proposal, those doubts now seem resolved by <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">On the merits, the proposal to allow the government to take depositions is consistent with the revision of rule 16 and with section 804(b)(1) of the Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates (November 1971) which provides that the following is not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Former Testimony. Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of another proceeding, at the instance of or against a party with an opportunity to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination, with motive and interest similar to those of the party against whom now offered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is revised to provide that the government as well as the defendant is entitled to take a deposition. The phrase &ldquo;whenever due to special circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice,&rdquo; is intended to make clear that the decision by the court as to whether to order the taking of a deposition shall be made in the context of the circumstances of the particular case. The principal objective is the preservation of evidence for use at trial. It is not to provide a method of pretrial discovery nor primarily for the purpose of obtaining a basis for later cross-examination of an adverse witness. Discovery is a matter dealt with in rule 16. An obviously important factor is whether a deposition will expedite, rather than delay, the administration of criminal justice. Also important is the presence or absence of factors which determine the use of a deposition at the trial, such as the agreement of the parties to use of the deposition; the possible unavailability of the witness; or the possibility that coercion may be used upon the witness to induce him to change his testimony or not to testify. See rule 16(a)(1)(v).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) also makes explicit that only the &ldquo;testimony of a prospective witness of a party&rdquo; can be taken. This means the party's own witness and does not authorize a discovery deposition of an adverse witness. The language &ldquo;for use at trial&rdquo; is intended to give further emphasis to the importance of the criteria for use specified in subdivision (e).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subdivision (b) reference is made to the defendant in custody. If he is in state custody, a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum (to produce the prisoner for purposes of testimony) may be required to accomplish his presence.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subdivision (d) the language &ldquo;except as otherwise provided in these rules&rdquo; is meant to make clear that the subpoena provisions of rule 17 control rather than the provisions of the civil rules.</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of the phrase &ldquo;and manner&rdquo; in subdivision (d)(2) is intended to emphasize that the authorization is not to conduct an adverse examination of an opposing witness.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subdivision (e) the phrase &ldquo;as substantive evidence&rdquo; is added to make clear that the deposition can be used as evidence in chief as well as for purposes of impeachment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) also makes clear that the deposition can be used as affirmative evidence whenever the witness is available but gives testimony inconsistent with that given in the deposition. A California statute which contained a similar provision was held constitutional in <em>California v. Green</em>, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). This is also consistent with section 801(d)(1) of the Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates (Nov. 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f) is intended to insure that a record of objections and the grounds for the objections is made at the time the deposition is taken when the witness is available so that the witness can be examined further, if necessary, on the point of the objection so that there will be an adequate record for the court's later ruling upon the objection.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g) uses the &ldquo;unavailability&rdquo; definition of the Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates, 804(a) (Nov. 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (h) is intended to make clear that the court always has authority to order the taking of a deposition, or to allow the use of a deposition, where there is an agreement of the parties to the taking or to the use.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides for the taking of depositions. The present rule permits only the defendant to move that a deposition of a prospective witness be taken. The court may grant the motion if it appears that (a) the prospective witness will be unable to attend or be prevented from attending the trial, (b) the prospective witness&rsquo; testimony is material, and (c) the prospective witness&rsquo; testimony is necessary to prevent a failure of justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court promulgated several amendments to Rule 15. The more significant amendments are described below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) as proposed to be amended permits either party to move the court for the taking of a deposition of a witness. However, a party may only move to take the deposition of one of its own witnesses, not one of the adversary party's witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) as proposed to be amended provides that whenever a deposition is taken at the instance of the government or of an indigent defendant, the expenses of the taking of the deposition must be paid by the government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) as proposed to be amended provides that part or all of the deposition may be used at trial as substantive evidence if the witness is &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; or if the witness gives testimony inconsistent with his deposition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)[(g)] as proposed to be amended defines &ldquo;unavailable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Unavailable&rdquo; as a witness includes situations in which the deponent:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) is exempted by ruling of the judge on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of his deposition; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of his deposition despite an order of the judge to do so; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of his deposition; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of his deposition has been unable to procure his attendance by process or other reasonable means. A deponent is not unavailable as a witness if his exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of his deposition for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee narrowed the definition of &ldquo;unavailability&rdquo; in subdivision (g). The Committee deleted language from that subdivision that provided that a witness was &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; if the court exempts him from testifying at the trial on the ground <!-- PDFPage:66 -->of privilege. The Committee does not want to encourage the use of depositions at trial, especially in view of the importance of having live testimony from a witness on the witness stand.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added a provision to subdivision (b) to parallel the provision of Rule 43(b)(2). This is to make it clear that a disruptive defendant may be removed from the place where a deposition is being taken.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added language to subdivision (c) to make clear that the government must pay for the cost of the transcript of a deposition when the deposition is taken at the instance of an indigent defendant or of the government. In order to use a deposition at trial, it must be transcribed. The proposed rule did not explicitly provide for payment of the cost of transcribing, and the Committee change rectifies this.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee notes that subdivision (e) permits the use of a deposition when the witness &ldquo;gives testimony at the trial or hearing inconsistent with his deposition.&rdquo; Since subdivision (e) refers to the rules of evidence, the Committee understands that the Federal Rules of Evidence will govern the admissibility and use of the deposition. The Committee, by adopting subdivision (e) as proposed to be amended by the Supreme Court, intends the Federal Rules of Evidence to govern the admissibility and use of the deposition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee believes that Rule 15 will not encourage trials by deposition. A deposition may be taken only in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; when &ldquo;it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo; A deposition, once it is taken, is not automatically admissible at trial, however. It may only be used at trial if the witness is unavailable, and the rule narrowly defines unavailability. The procedure established in Rule 15 is similar to the procedure established by the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 for the taking and use of depositions in organized crime cases. See 18 U.S.C. 3503.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Conference Committee Notes, House Report No. 94&ndash;414; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 15 deals with the taking of depositions and the use of depositions at trial. Rule 15(e) permits a deposition to be used if the witness is unavailable. Rule 15(g) defines that term.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court's proposal defines five circumstances in which the witness will be considered unavailable. The House version of the bill deletes a provision that said a witness is unavailable if he is exempted at trial, on the ground of privilege, from testifying about the subject matter of his deposition. The Senate version of the bill by cross reference to the Federal Rules of Evidence, restores the Supreme Court proposal.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate provision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Information Subject to Disclosure.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Defendant</cap-smallcap>. Upon request of a defendant the government must disclose to the defendant and make available for inspection, copying, or photographing: any relevant written or recorded statements made by the defendant, or copies thereof, within the possession, custody, or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government; that portion of any written record containing the substance of any relevant oral statement made by the defendant whether before or after arrest in response to interrogation by any person then known to the defendant to be a government agent; and recorded testimony of the defendant before a grand jury which relates to the offense charged. The government must also disclose to the defendant the substance of any other relevant oral statement made by the defendant whether before or after arrest in response to interrogation by any person then known by the defendant to be a government agent if the government intends to use that statement at trial. Upon request of a defendant which is an organization such as a corporation, partnership, association or labor union, the government must disclose to the defendant any of the foregoing statements made by a person who the government contends (1) was, at the time of making the statement, so situated as a director, officer, employee, or agent as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to the subject of the statement, or (2) was, at the time of the offense, personally involved in the alleged conduct constituting the offense and so situated as a director, officer, employee, or agent as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to that alleged conduct in which the person was involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Defendant's Prior Record</cap-smallcap>. Upon request of the defendant, the government shall furnish to the defendant such copy of the defendant's prior criminal record, if any, as is within the possession, custody, or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:67 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Documents and Tangible Objects</cap-smallcap>. Upon request of the defendant the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions thereof, which are within the possession, custody or control of the government, and which are material to the preparation of the defendant's defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Reports of Examinations and Tests</cap-smallcap>. Upon request of a defendant the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph any results or reports of physical or mental examinations, and of scientific tests or experiments, or copies thereof, which are within the possession, custody, or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government, and which are material to the preparation of the defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Expert Witnesses</cap-smallcap>. At the defendant's request, the government shall disclose to the defendant a written summary of testimony that the government intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence during its case-in-chief at trial. If the government requests discovery under subdivision (b)(1)(C)(ii) of this rule and the defendant complies, the government shall, at the defendant's request, disclose to the defendant a written summary of testimony the government intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 as evidence at trial on the issue of the defendant's mental condition. The summary provided under this subdivision shall describe the witnesses&rsquo; opinions, the bases and the reasons for those opinions, and the witnesses&rsquo; qualifications.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Information Not Subject to Disclosure</em>. Except as provided in paragraphs (A), (B), (D), and (E) of subdivision (a)(1), this rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or any other government agent investigating or prosecuting the case. Nor does the rule authorize the discovery or inspection of statements made by government witnesses or prospective government witnesses except as provided in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Grand Jury Transcripts</em>. Except as provided in Rules 6, 12(i) and 26.2, and subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this rule, these rules do not relate to discovery or inspection of recorded proceedings of a grand jury.</p>

If the defendant requests disclosure under subdivision (a)(1)(C) or (D) of this rule, upon compliance with such request by the government, the defendant, on request of the government, shall permit the government to inspect and copy or photograph books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, or copies or portions thereof, which are within the possession, custody, or control of the defendant and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence in chief at the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Reports of Examinations and Tests</cap-smallcap>. If the defendant requests disclosure under subdivision (a)(1)(C) or (D) of this rule, upon compliance with such request by the government, the defendant, on request of the government, shall permit the government to inspect and copy or photograph any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with the particular case, or copies thereof, within the possession or control of the defendant, which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence in chief at the trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at the trial when the results or reports relate to that witness&rsquo; testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Expert Witnesses</cap-smallcap>. Under the following circumstances, the defendant shall, at the government's request, disclose to the government a written summary of testimony that the defendant intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence as evidence at trial: (i) if the defendant requests disclosure under subdivision (a)(1)(E) of this rule and the government complies, or (ii) if the defendant has given notice under Rule 12.2(b) of an intent to present expert testimony on the defendant's mental condition. This summary shall describe the witnesses&rsquo; opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witnesses&rsquo; qualifications.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Information Not Subject to Disclosure</em>. Except as to scientific or medical reports, this subdivision does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal defense documents made by the defendant, or the defendant's attorneys or agents in connection with the investigation or defense of the case, or of statements made by the defendant, or by government or defense witnesses, or by prospective government or defense witnesses, to the defendant, the defendant's agents or attorneys.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Regulation of Discovery.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Protective and Modifying Orders</em>. Upon a sufficient showing the court may at any time order that the discovery or inspection be denied, restricted, or deferred, or make such other order as is appropriate. Upon motion by a party, the court may permit the party to <!-- PDFPage:68 -->make such showing, in whole or in part, in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the judge alone. If the court enters an order granting relief following such an ex parte showing, the entire text of the party's statement shall be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Failure To Comply With a Request</em>. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing evidence not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances. The court may specify the time, place and manner of making the discovery and inspection and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are just.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">Whether under existing law discovery may be permitted in criminal cases is doubtful, <em>United States v. Rosenfeld</em>, 57 F.2d 74 (C.C.A. 2d)&mdash;cert. den., 286 U.S. 556. The courts have, however, made orders granting to the defendant an opportunity to inspect impounded documents belonging to him, <em>United States v. B. Goedde and Co</em>., 40 F.Supp. 523, 534 (E.D.Ill.). The rule is a restatement of this procedure. In addition, it permits the procedure to be invoked in cases of objects and documents obtained from others by seizure or by process, on the theory that such evidential matter would probably have been accessible to the defendant if it had not previously been seized by the prosecution. The entire matter is left within the discretion of the court.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The extent to which pretrial discovery should be permitted in criminal cases is a complex and controversial issue. The problems have been explored in detail in recent legal literature, most of which has been in favor of increasing the range of permissible discovery. See, e.g. Brennan, The Criminal Prosecution: Sporting Event or Quest for Truth, 1963 Wash.U.L.Q. 279; Everett, Discovery in Criminal Cases&mdash;In Search of a Standard, 1964 Duke L.J. 477; Fletcher, Pretrial Discovery in State Criminal Cases, 12 Stan.L.Rev. 293 (1960); Goldstein, The State and the Accused: Balance of Advantage in Criminal Procedure, 69 Yale L.J. 1149, 1172&ndash;1198 (1960); Krantz, Pretrial Discovery in Criminal Cases: A Necessity for Fair and Impartial Justice, 42 Neb.L.Rev. 127 (1962); Louisell, Criminal Discovery: Dilemma Real or Apparent, 49 Calif.L.Rev. 56 (1961); Louisell, The Theory of Criminal Discovery and the Practice of Criminal Law, 14 Vand.L.Rev. 921 (1961); Moran, Federal Criminal Rules Changes: Aid or Illusion for the Indigent Defendant? 51 A.B.A.J. 64 (1965); Symposium, Discovery in Federal Criminal Cases, 33 F.R.D. 47&ndash;128 (1963); Traynor, Ground Lost and Found in Criminal Discovery, 39 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 228 (1964); Developments in the Law&mdash;Discovery, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 940, 1051&ndash;1063. Full judicial exploration of the conflicting policy considerations will be found in <em>State v. Tune</em>, 13 N.J. 203, 98 A.2d 881 (1953) and <em>State v. Johnson</em>, 28 N.J. 133, 145 A.2d 313 (1958); cf. <em>State v. Murphy</em>, 36 N.J. 172, 175 A.2d 622 (1961); <em>State v. Moffa</em>, 36 N.J. 219, 176 A.2d 1 (1961). The rule has been revised to expand the scope of pretrial discovery. At the same time provisions are made to guard against possible abuses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a).&mdash;The court is authorized to order the attorney for the government to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph three different types of material:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Relevant written or recorded statements or confessions made by the defendant, or copies thereof. The defendant is not required to designate because he may not always be aware that his statements or confessions are being recorded. The government's obligation is limited to production of such statements as are within the possession, custody or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government. Discovery of statements and confessions is in line with what the Supreme Court has described as the &ldquo;better practice&rdquo; (<em>Cicenia v. LaGay</em>, 357 U.S. 504, 511 (1958)), and with the law in a number of states. See e.g., Del. Rules Crim. Proc., Rule 16; Ill.Stat. Ch. 38, &sect;729; Md. Rules Proc., Rule 728; <em>State v. McGee</em>, 91 Ariz. 101, 370 P.2d 261 (1962); <em>Cash v. Superior Court</em>, 53 Cal.2d 72, 346 P.2d 407 (1959); <em>State v. Bickham</em>, 239 La. 1094, 121 So.2d 207, cert. den. 364 U.S. 874 (1960); <em>People v. Johnson</em>, 356 Mich. 619, 97 N.W.2d 739 (1959); <em>State v. Johnson</em>, supra; <em>People v. Stokes</em>, 24 Miss.2d 755, 204 N.Y.Supp.2d 827 (Ct.Gen.Sess. 1960). The amendment also makes it clear that discovery extends to recorded as well as written statements. For state cases upholding the discovery of recordings, see, e.g., <em>People v. Cartier</em>, 51 Cal.2d 590, 335 P.2d 114 (1959); <em>State v. Minor</em>, 177 A.2d 215 (Del.Super.Ct. 1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Relevant results or reports of physical or mental examinations, and of scientific tests or experiments (including fingerprint and handwriting comparisons) made in connection with the particular case, or copies thereof. Again the defendant is not required to designate but the government's obligation is limited to production of items within the possession, custody or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government. With respect to results or reports of scientific tests or experiments the range of materials which must be produced by the government is further limited to those made in connection with the particular case. Cf. Fla.Stats. &sect;909.18; <em>State v. Superior Court</em>, 90 Ariz. 133, 367 P.2d 6 (1961); <em>People v. Cooper</em>, 53 Cal.2d 755, 770, 3 Cal.Rptr. 148, 157, 349 P.2d 1964, 973 (1960); <em>People v. Stokes</em>, supra, at 762, 204 N.Y.Supp.2d at 835.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Relevant recorded testimony of a defendant before a grand jury. The policy which favors pretrial disclosure to a defendant of his statements to government agents also supports, pretrial disclosure of his testimony before a grand jury. Courts, however, have tended to require a showing of special circumstances before ordering such disclosure. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 215 F.Supp. 300 (D.Md. 1963). Disclosure is required only where the statement has been recorded and hence can be transcribed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;This subdivision authorizes the court to order the attorney for the government to permit the defendant to inspect the copy or photograph all other books, papers, documents, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions thereof, which are within the possession, custody or control of the government. Because of the necessarily broad and general terms in which the items to be discovered are described, several limitations are imposed:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) While specific designation is not required of the defendant, the burden is placed on him to make a showing of materiality to the preparation of his defense and that his request is reasonable. The requirement of reasonableness will permit the court to define and limit <!-- PDFPage:69 -->the scope of the government's obligation to search its files while meeting the legitimate needs of the defendant. The court is also authorized to limit discovery to portions of items sought.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Reports, memoranda, and other internal government documents made by government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case are exempt from discovery. Cf. <em>Palermo v. United States</em>, 360 U.S. 343 (1959); <em>Ogden v. United States</em>, 303 F.2d 724 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Except as provided for reports of examinations and tests in subdivision (a)(2), statements made by government witnesses or prospective government witnesses to agents of the government are also exempt from discovery except as provided by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c).&mdash;This subdivision permits the court to condition a discovery order under subdivision (a)(2) and subdivision (b) by requiring the defendant to permit the government to discover similar items which the defendant intends to produce at the trial and which are within his possession, custody or control under restrictions similar to those placed in subdivision (b) upon discovery by the defendant. While the government normally has resources adequate to secure the information necessary for trial, there are some situations in which mutual disclosure would appear necessary to prevent the defendant from obtaining an unfair advantage. For example, in cases where both prosecution and defense have employed experts to make psychiatric examinations, it seems as important for the government to study the opinions of the experts to be called by the defendant in order to prepare for trial as it does for the defendant to study those of the government's witnesses. Or in cases (such as antitrust cases) in which the defendant is well represented and well financed, mutual disclosure so far as consistent with the privilege against self-incrimination would seem as appropriate as in civil cases. State cases have indicated that a requirement that the defendant disclose in advance of trial materials which he intends to use on his own behalf at the trial is not a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination. See <em>Jones v. Superior Court</em>, 58 Cal.2d 56, 22 Cal.Rptr. 879, 372 P.2d 919 (1962); <em>People v. Lopez</em>, 60 Cal.2d 223, 32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16 (1963); Traynor, Ground Lost and Found in Criminal Discovery. 39 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 228, 246 (1964); Comment, The Self-Incrimination Privilege: Barrier to Criminal Discovery, 51 Calif.L.Rev. 135 (1963); Note, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 828 (1963).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d).&mdash;This subdivision is substantially the same as the last sentence of the existing rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e).&mdash;This subdivision gives the court authority to deny, restrict or defer discovery upon a sufficient showing. Control of the abuses of discovery is necessary if it is to be expanded in the fashion proposed in subdivisions (a) and (b). Among the considerations to be taken into account by the court will be the safety of witnesses and others, a particular danger of perjury or witness intimidation, the protection of information vital to the national security, and the protection of business enterprises from economic reprisals.</p>
<p class="note-body">For an example of a use of a protective order in state practice, see <em>People v. Lopez</em>, 60 Cal.2d 223, 32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16 (1963). See also Brennan, Remarks on Discovery, 33 F.R.D. 56, 65 (1963); Traynor, Ground Lost and Found in Criminal Discovery, 39 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 228, 244, 250.</p>
<p class="note-body">In some cases it would defeat the purpose of the protective order if the government were required to make its showing in open court. The problem arises in its most extreme form where matters of national security are involved. Hence a procedure is set out where upon motion by the government the court may permit the government to make its showing, in whole or in part, in a written statement to be inspected by the court in camera. If the court grants relief based on such showing, the government's statement is to be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal by the defendant, Cf. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f).&mdash;This subdivision is designed to encourage promptness in making discovery motions and to give the court sufficient control to prevent unnecessary delay and court time consequent upon a multiplication of discovery motions. Normally one motion should encompass all relief sought and a subsequent motion permitted only upon a showing of cause. Where pretrial hearings are used pursuant to Rule 17.1, discovery issues may be resolved at such hearings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (g).&mdash;The first sentence establishes a continuing obligation on a party subject to a discovery order with respect to material discovered after initial compliance. The duty provided is to notify the other party, his attorney or the court of the existence of the material. A motion can then be made by the other party for additional discovery and, where the existence of the material is disclosed shortly before or during the trial, for any necessary continuance.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence gives wide discretion to the court in dealing with the failure of either party to comply with a discovery order. Such discretion will permit the court to consider the reasons why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 16 is revised to give greater discovery to both the prosecution and the defense. Subdivision (a) deals with disclosure of evidence by the government. Subdivision (b) deals with disclosure of evidence by the defendant. The majority of the Advisory Committee is of the view that the two&mdash;prosecution and defense discovery&mdash;are related and that the giving of a broader right of discovery to the defense is dependent upon giving also a broader right of discovery to the prosecution.</p>
<p class="note-body">The draft provides for a right of prosecution discovery independent of any prior request for discovery by the defendant. The Advisory Committee is of the view that this is the most desirable approach to prosecution discovery. See American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial, pp. 7, 43&ndash;46 (Approved Draft, 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">The language of the rule is recast from &ldquo;the court may order&rdquo; or &ldquo;the court shall order&rdquo; to &ldquo;the government shall permit&rdquo; or &ldquo;the defendant shall permit.&rdquo; This is to make clear that discovery should be accomplished by the parties themselves, without the necessity of a court order unless there is dispute as to whether the matter is discoverable or a request for a protective order under subdivision (d)(1). The court, however, has the inherent right to enter an order under this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is intended to prescribe the minimum amount of discovery to which the parties are entitled. It is not intended to limit the judge's discretion to order broader discovery in appropriate cases. For example, subdivision (a)(3) is not intended to deny a judge's discretion to order disclosure of grand jury minutes where circumstances make it appropriate to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(A) amends the old rule to provide, upon request of the defendant, the government shall permit discovery if the conditions specified in subdivision (a)(1)(A) exist. Some courts have construed the current language as giving the court discretion as to whether to grant discovery of defendant's statements. See <em>United States v. Kaminsky</em>, 275 F.Supp. 365 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), denying discovery because the defendant did not demonstrate that his request for discovery was warranted; <em>United States v. Diliberto</em>, 264 F.Supp. 181 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), holding that there must be a showing of actual need before discovery would be granted; <em>United States v. Louis Carreau</em>, Inc., 42 F.R.D. 408 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), holding that in the absence of a showing of good cause the government cannot be required to disclose defendant's prior statements in advance of trial. In <em>United States v. Louis Carreau</em>, Inc., at p. 412, the court stated that if rule 16 meant that production of the statements was mandatory, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would have been used instead of &ldquo;may.&rdquo; See also <em>United States <!-- PDFPage:70 -->v. Wallace</em>, 272 F.Supp. 838 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); <em>United States v. Wood</em>, 270 F.Supp. 963 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); <em>United States v. Leighton</em>, 265 F.Supp. 27 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); <em>United States v. Longarzo</em>, 43 F.R.D. 395 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); <em>Loux v. United States</em>, 389 F.2d 911 (9th Cir. 1968); and the discussion of discovery in Discovery in Criminal Cases, 44 F.R.D. 481 (1968). Other courts have held that even though the current rules make discovery discretionary, the defendant need not show cause when he seeks to discover his own statements. See <em>United States v. Aadal</em>, 280 F.Supp. 859 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); <em>United States v. Federmann</em>, 41 F.R.D. 339 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); and <em>United States v. Projansky</em>, 44 F.R.D. 550 (S.D.N.Y. 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment making disclosure mandatory under the circumstances prescribed in subdivision (a)(1)(A) resolves such ambiguity as may currently exist, in the direction of more liberal discovery. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;253 (1969, Supp. 1971), Rezneck, The New Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 54 Geo.L.J. 1276 (1966); Fla.Stat.Ann. &sect;925.05 (Supp. 1971&ndash;1972); N.J.Crim.Prac.Rule 35&ndash;11(a) (1967). This is done in the view that broad discovery contributes to the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice by providing the defendant with enough information to make an informed decision as to plea; by minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise at the trial; and by otherwise contributing to an accurate determination of the issue of guilt or innocence. This is the ground upon which the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial (Approved Draft, 1970) has unanimously recommended broader discovery. The United States Supreme Court has said that the pretrial disclosure of a defendant's statements &ldquo;may be the &lsquo;better practice.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>Cicenia v. La Gay</em>, 357 U.S. 504, 511, 78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523 (1958). See also <em>Leland v. Oregon</em>, 343 U.S. 790, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1952); <em>State v. Johnson</em>, 28 N.J. 133, 145 A.2d 313 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement that the statement be disclosed prior to trial, rather than waiting until the trial, also contributes to efficiency of administration. It is during the pretrial stage that the defendant usually decides whether to plead guilty. See <em>United States v. Projansky</em>, supra. The pretrial stage is also the time during which many objections to the admissibility of types of evidence ought to be made. Pretrial disclosure ought, therefore, to contribute both to an informed guilty plea practice and to a pretrial resolution of admissibility questions. See ABA, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;1.2 and Commentary pp. 40&ndash;43 (Approved Draft, 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">The American Bar Association Standards mandate the prosecutor to make the required disclosure even though not requested to do so by the defendant. The proposed draft requires the defendant to request discovery, although obviously the attorney for the government may disclose without waiting for a request, and there are situations in which due process will require the prosecution, on its own, to disclose evidence &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; to the defense. <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); <em>Giles v. Maryland</em>, 386 U.S. 66, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">The requirement in subdivision (a)(1)(A) is that the government produce &ldquo;statements&rdquo; without further discussion of what &ldquo;statement&rdquo; includes. There has been some recent controversy over what &ldquo;statements&rdquo; are subject to discovery under the current rule. See Discovery in Criminal Cases, 44 F.R.D. 481 (1968); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;253, pp. 505&ndash;506 (1969, Supp. 1971). The kinds of &ldquo;statements&rdquo; which have been held to be within the rule include &ldquo;substantially verbatim and contemporaneous&rdquo; statements, <em>United States v. Elife</em>, 43 F.R.D. 23 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); statements which reproduce the defendant's &ldquo;exact words,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Armantrout</em>, 278 F.Supp. 517 (S.D.N.Y. 1968); a memorandum which was not verbatim but included the substance of the defendant's testimony, <em>United States v. Scharf</em>, 267 F.Supp. 19 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); Summaries of the defendant's statements, <em>United States v. Morrison</em>, 43 F.R.D. 516 (N.D.Ill. 1967); and statements discovered by means of electronic surveillance, <em>United States v. Black</em>, 282 F.Supp. 35 (D.D.C. 1968). The court in <em>United States v. Iovinelli</em>, 276 F.Supp. 629, 631 (N.D.Ill. 1967), declared that &ldquo;statements&rdquo; as used in old rule 16 is not restricted to the &ldquo;substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement&rdquo; or to statements which are a &ldquo;recital of past occurrences.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500, defines &ldquo;statements&rdquo; of government witnesses discoverable for purposes of cross-examination as: (1) a &ldquo;written statement&rdquo; signed or otherwise approved by a witness, (2) &ldquo;a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness to an agent of the government and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.&rdquo; 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500(e). The language of the Jencks Act has most often led to a restrictive definition of &ldquo;statements,&rdquo; confining &ldquo;statements&rdquo; to the defendant's &ldquo;own words.&rdquo; See <em>Hanks v. United States</em>, 388 F.2d 171 (10th Cir. 1968), and <em>Augenblick v. United States</em>, 377 F.2d 586, 180 Ct.Cl. 131 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">The American Bar Association's Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial (Approved Draft, 1970) do not attempt to define &ldquo;statements&rdquo; because of a disagreement among members of the committee as to what the definition should be. The majority rejected the restrictive definition of &ldquo;statements&rdquo; contained in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500(e), in the view that the defendant ought to be able to see his statement in whatever form it may have been preserved in fairness to the defendant and to discourage the practice, where it exists, of destroying original notes, after transforming them into secondary transcriptions, in order to avoid cross-examination based upon the original notes. See <em>Campbell v. United States</em>, 373 U.S. 487, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501 (1963). The minority favored a restrictive definition of &ldquo;statements&rdquo; in the view that the use of other than &ldquo;verbatim&rdquo; statements would subject witnesses to unfair cross-examination. See American Bar Association's Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial pp. 61&ndash;64 (Approved Draft, 1970). The draft of subdivision (a)(1)(A) leaves the matter of the meaning of the term unresolved and thus left for development on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(A) also provides for mandatory disclosure of a summary of any oral statement made by defendant to a government agent which the attorney for the government intends to use in evidence. The reasons for permitting the defendant to discover his own statements seem obviously to apply to the substance of any oral statement which the government intends to use in evidence at the trial. See American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.1(a)(ii) (Approved Draft, 1970). Certainly disclosure will facilitate the raising of objections to admissibility prior to trial. There have been several conflicting decisions under the current rules as to whether the government must disclose the substance of oral statements of the defendant which it has in its possession. Cf. <em>United States v. Baker</em>, 262 F.Supp. 657 (D.C.D.C. 1966); <em>United States v. Curry</em>, 278 F.Supp. 508 (N.D.Ill. 1967); <em>United States v. Morrison</em>, 43 F.R.D. 516 (ND.Ill. 1967); <em>United States v. Reid</em>, 43 F.R.D. 520 (ND.Ill. 1967); <em>United States v. Armantrout</em>, 278 F.Supp. 517 (S.D.N.Y. 1968); and <em>United States v. Elife</em>, 43 F.R.D. 23 (S.D.N.Y. 1967). There is, however, considerable support for the policy of disclosing the substance of the defendant's oral statement. Many courts have indicated that this is a &ldquo;better practice&rdquo; than denying such disclosure. E.g., <em>United States v. Curry</em>, supra; <em>Loux v. United States</em>, 389 F.2d 911 (9th Cir. 1968); and <em>United States v. Baker</em>, supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(A) also provides for mandatory disclosure of any &ldquo;recorded testimony&rdquo; which defendant gives before a grand jury if the testimony &ldquo;relates to the offense charged.&rdquo; The present rule is discretionary and is applicable only to those of defendant's statements which are &ldquo;relevant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The traditional rationale behind grand jury secrecy&mdash;protection of witnesses&mdash;does not apply when the ac<!-- PDFPage:71 -->cused seeks discovery of his own testimony. Cf. <em>Dennis v. United States</em>, 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966); and <em>Allen v. United States</em>, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 61, 390 F.2d 476 (1968). In interpreting the rule many judges have granted defendant discovery without a showing of need or relevance. <em>United States v. Gleason</em>, 259 F.Supp. 282 (S.D.N.Y. 1966); <em>United States v. Longarzo</em>, 43 F.R.D. 395 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); and <em>United States v. United Concrete Pipe Corp</em>., 41 F.R.D. 538 (N.D.Tex. 1966). Making disclosure mandatory without a showing of relevance conforms to the recommendation of the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.1(a)(iii) and Commentary pp. 64&ndash;66 (Approved Draft, 1970). Also see Note, Discovery by a Criminal Defendant of His Own Grand-Jury Testimony, 68 Columbia L.Rev. 311 (1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">In a situation involving a corporate defendant, statements made by present and former officers and employees relating to their employment have been held discoverable as statements of the defendant. <em>United States v. Hughes</em>, 413 F.2d 1244 (5th Cir. 1969). The rule makes clear that such statements are discoverable if the officer or employee was &ldquo;able legally to bind the defendant in respect to the activities involved in the charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(B) allows discovery of the defendant's prior criminal record. A defendant may be uncertain of the precise nature of his prior record and it seems therefore in the interest of efficient and fair administration to make it possible to resolve prior to trial any disputes as to the correctness of the relevant criminal record of the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(C) gives a right of discovery of certain tangible objects under the specified circumstances. Courts have construed the old rule as making disclosure discretionary with the judge. Cf. <em>United States v. Kaminsky</em>, 275 F.Supp. 365 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); <em>Gevinson v. United States</em>, 358 F.2d 761 (5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 823, 87 S.Ct. 51, 17 L.Ed.2d 60 (1966); and <em>United States v. Tanner</em>, 279 F.Supp. 457 (N.D.Ill. 1967). The old rule requires a &ldquo;showing of materiality to the preparation of his defense and that the request is reasonable.&rdquo; The new rule requires disclosure if any one of three situations exists: (a) the defendant shows that disclosure of the document or tangible object is material to the defense, (b) the government intends to use the document or tangible object in its presentation of its case in chief, or (c) the document or tangible object was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Disclosure of documents and tangible objects which are &ldquo;material&rdquo; to the preparation of the defense may be required under the rule of <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), without an additional showing that the request is &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo; In <em>Brady</em> the court held that &ldquo;due process&rdquo; requires that the prosecution disclose evidence favorable to the accused. Although the Advisory Committee decided not to codify the Brady Rule, the requirement that the government disclose documents and tangible objects &ldquo;material to the preparation of his defense&rdquo; underscores the importance of disclosure of evidence favorable to the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Limiting the rule to situations in which the defendant can show that the evidence is material seems unwise. It may be difficult for a defendant to make this showing if he does not know what the evidence is. For this reason subdivision (a)(1)(C) also contains language to compel disclosure if the government intends to use the property as evidence at the trial or if the property was obtained from or belongs to the defendant. See ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.1(a)(v) and Commentary pp. 68&ndash;69 (Approved Draft, 1970). This is probably the result under old rule 16 since the fact that the government intends to use the physical evidence at the trial is probably sufficient proof of &ldquo;materiality.&rdquo; C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;254 especially n. 70 at p. 513 (1969, Supp. 1971). But it seems desirable to make this explicit in the rule itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring disclosure of documents and tangible objects which &ldquo;were obtained from or belong to the defendant&rdquo; probably is also making explicit in the rule what would otherwise be the interpretation of &ldquo;materiality.&rdquo; See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;254 at p. 510 especially n. 58 (1969, Supp. 1971).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(C) is also amended to add the word &ldquo;photographs&rdquo; to the objects previously listed. See ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.1(a)(v) (Approved Draft, 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(D) makes disclosure of the reports of examinations and tests mandatory. This is the recommendation of the ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.1(a)(iv) and Commentary pp. 66&ndash;68 (Approved Draft, 1970). The obligation of disclosure applies only to scientific tests or experiments &ldquo;made in connection with the particular case.&rdquo; So limited, mandatory disclosure seems justified because: (1) it is difficult to test expert testimony at trial without advance notice and preparation; (2) it is not likely that such evidence will be distorted or misused if disclosed prior to trial; and (3) to the extent that a test may be favorable to the defense, its disclosure is mandated under the rule of <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(E) is new. It provides for discovery of the names of witnesses to be called by the government and of the prior criminal record of these witnesses. Many states have statutes or rules which require that the accused be notified prior to trial of the witnesses to be called against him. See, e.g., Alaska R.Crim.Proc. 7(c); Ariz.R.Crim.Proc. 153, 17 A.R.S. (1956); Ark.Stat.Ann. &sect;43&ndash;1001 (1947); Cal.Pen.Code &sect;995n (West 1957); Colo.Rev.Stat.Ann. &sect;&sect;39&ndash;3&ndash;6, 39&ndash;4&ndash;2 (1963); Fla.Stat.Ann. &sect;906.29 (1944); Idaho Code Ann. &sect;19&ndash;1404 (1948); Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, &sect;114&ndash;9 (1970); Ind.Ann.Stat. &sect;9&ndash;903 (1856), IC 1971, 35&ndash;1&ndash;16&ndash;3; Iowa Code Ann. &sect;772.3 (1950); Kan.Stat.Ann. &sect;62&ndash;931 (1964); Ky.R.Crim. Proc. 6.08 (1962); Mich.Stat.Ann. &sect;28.980, M.C.L.A. &sect;767.40 (Supp.1971); Minn.Stat.Ann. &sect;628.08 (1947); Mo.Ann.Stat. &sect;545.070 (1953); Mont.Rev. Codes Ann. &sect;95&ndash;1503 (Supp. 1969); Neb.Rev.Stat. &sect;29&ndash;1602 (1964); Nev.Rev.Stat. &sect;173.045 (1967); Okl.Stat. tet. 22, &sect;384 (1951); Ore.Rev.Stat. &sect;132.580 (1969); Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;40&ndash;1708 (1955); Utah Code Ann. &sect;77&ndash;20&ndash;3 (1953). For examples of the ways in which these requirements are implemented, see <em>State v. Mitchell</em>, 181 Kan. 193, 310 P.2d 1063 (1957); <em>State v. Parr</em>, 129 Mont. 175, 283 P.2d 1086 (1955); <em>Phillips v. State</em>, 157 Neb. 419, 59 N.W. 598 (1953).</p>
<p class="note-body">Witnesses&rsquo; prior statements must be made available to defense counsel after the witness testifies on direct examination for possible impeachment purposes during trial: 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500.</p>
<p class="note-body">The American Bar Association's Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.1(a)(i) (Approved Draft, 1970) require disclosure of both the names and the statements of prosecution witnesses. Subdivision (a)(1)(E) requires only disclosure, prior to trial, of names, addresses, and prior criminal record. It does not require disclosure of the witnesses&rsquo; statements although the rule does not preclude the parties from agreeing to disclose statements prior to trial. This is done, for example, in courts using the so-called &ldquo;omnibus hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Disclosure of the prior criminal record of witnesses places the defense in the same position as the government, which normally has knowledge of the defendant's record and the record of anticipated defense witnesses. In addition, the defendant often lacks means of procuring this information on his own. See American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.1(a)(vi) (Approved Draft, 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">A principal argument against disclosure of the identity of witnesses prior to trial has been the danger to the witness, his being subjected either to physical harm or to threats designed to make the witness unavailable or to influence him to change his testimony. Discovery in Criminal cases, 44 F.R.D. 481, 499&ndash;500 (1968); Ratnoff, The New Criminal Deposition Statute in Ohio&mdash;Help or Hindrance to Justice?, 19 Case Western Reserve L.Rev. 279, 284 (1968). See, e.g., <em>United States v. Estep</em>, 151 F.Supp. 668, 672&ndash;673 (N.D. Tex. 1957):</p>
<!-- PDFPage:72 --><p class="note-body-1em">Ninety percent of the convictions had in the trial court for sale and dissemination of narcotic drugs are linked to the work and the evidence obtained by an informer. If that informer is not to have his life protected there won't be many informers hereafter.</p>
<p class="note-body">See also the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Clark in <em>Roviaro v. United States</em>, 353 U.S. 53, 66&ndash;67, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). Threats of market retaliation against witnesses in criminal antitrust cases are another illustration. <em>Bergen Drug Co. v. Parke, Davis & Company</em>, 307 F.2d 725 (3d Cir. 1962); and <em>House of Materials, Inc. v. Simplicity Pattern Co</em>., 298 F.2d 867 (2d Cir. 1962). The government has two alternatives when it believes disclosure will create an undue risk of harm to the witness: It can ask for a protective order under subdivision (d)(1). See ABA Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.5(b) (Approved Draft, 1970). It can also move the court to allow the perpetuation of a particular witness's testimony for use at trial if the witness is unavailable or later changes his testimony. The purpose of the latter alternative is to make pretrial disclosure possible and at the same time to minimize any inducement to use improper means to force the witness either to not show up or to change his testimony before a jury. See rule 15.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(2) is substantially unchanged. It limits the discovery otherwise allowed by providing that the government need not disclose &ldquo;reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or other government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case&rdquo; or &ldquo;statements made by government witnesses or prospective government witnesses.&rdquo; The only proposed change is that the &ldquo;reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government&rdquo; are included to make clear that the work product of the government attorney is protected. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;254 n. 92 (1969, Supp. 1971); <em>United States v. Rothman</em>, 179 F.Supp. 935 (W.D.Pa. 1959); Note, &ldquo;Work Product&rdquo; in Criminal Discovery, 1966 Wash.U.L.Q. 321; American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;2.6(a) (Approved Draft, 1970); cf. <em>Hickman v. Taylor</em>, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947). <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed2d 215 (1963), requires the disclosure of evidence favorable to the defendant. This is, of course, not changed by this rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(3) is included to make clear that recorded proceedings of a grand jury are explicitly dealt with in rule 6 and subdivision (a)(1)(A) of rule 16 and thus are not covered by other provisions such as subdivision (a)(1)(C) which deals generally with discovery of documents in the possession, custody, or control of the government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(4) is designed to insure that the government will not be penalized if it makes a full disclosure of all potential witnesses and then decides not to call one or more of the witnesses listed. This is not, however, intended to abrogate the defendant's right to comment generally upon the government's failure to call witnesses in an appropriate case.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) deals with the government's right to discovery of defense evidence or, put in other terms, with the extent to which a defendant is required to disclose its evidence to the prosecution prior to trial. Subdivision (b) replaces old subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) enlarges the right of government discovery in several ways: (1) it gives the government the right to discovery of lists of defense witnesses as well as physical evidence and the results of examinations and tests; (2) it requires disclosure if the defendant has the evidence under his control and intends to use it at trial in his case in chief, without the additional burden, required by the old rule, of having to show, in behalf of the government, that the evidence is material and the request reasonable; and (3) it gives the government the right to discovery without conditioning that right upon the existence of a prior request for discovery by the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the government normally has resources adequate to secure much of the evidence for trial, there are situations in which pretrial disclosure of evidence to the government is in the interest of effective and fair criminal justice administration. For example, the experimental &ldquo;omnibus hearing&rdquo; procedure (see discussion in Advisory Committee Note to rule 12) is based upon an assumption that the defendant, as well as the government, will be willing to disclose evidence prior to trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Having reached the conclusion that it is desirable to require broader disclosure by the defendant under certain circumstances, the Advisory Committee has taken the view that it is preferable to give the right of discovery to the government independently of a prior request for discovery by the defendant. This is the recommendation of the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial, Commentary, pp. 43&ndash;46 (Approved Draft, 1970). It is sometimes asserted that making the government's right to discovery conditional will minimize the risk that government discovery will be viewed as an infringement of the defendant's constitutional rights. See discussion in C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;256 (1969, Supp.1971); Moore, Criminal Discovery, 19 Hastings L.J. 865 (1968); Wilder, Prosecution Discovery and the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 6 Am.Cr.L.Q. 3 (1967). There are assertions that prosecution discovery, even if conditioned upon the defendants being granted discovery, is a violation of the privilege. See statements of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas, 39 F.R.D. 69, 272, 277&ndash;278 19 (1966); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;256 (1969, Supp. 1971). Several states require defense disclosure of an intended defense of alibi and, in some cases, a list of witnesses in support of an alibi defense, without making the requirement conditional upon prior discovery being given to the defense. E.g., Ariz.R.Crim.P. 162(B), 17 A.R.S. (1956); Ind.Ann.Stat. &sect;9&ndash;1631 to 9&ndash;1633 (1956), IC 1971, 35&ndash;5&ndash;1&ndash;1 to 35&ndash;5&ndash;1&ndash;3; Mich.Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect;768.20, 768.21 (1968); N.Y. CPL &sect;250.20 (McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 11&ndash;A, 1971); and Ohio Rev.Code Ann. &sect;2945.58 (1954). State courts have refused to hold these statutes violative of the privilege against self-incrimination. See <em>State v. Thayer</em>, 124 Ohio St. 1, 176 N.E. 656 (1931), and <em>People v. Rakiec</em>, 260 App.Div. 452, 23 N.Y.S.2d 607, aff'd, 289 N.Y. 306, 45 N.E.2d 812 (1942). See also rule 12.1 and Advisory Committee Note thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body">Some state courts have held that a defendant may be required to disclose, in advance of trial, evidence which he intends to use on his own behalf at trial without violating the privilege against self-incrimination. See <em>Jones v. Superior Court of Nevada County</em>, 58 Cal.2d 56, 22 Cal.Rptr. 879, 372 P.2d 919 (1962); <em>People v. Lopez</em>, 60 Cal.2d 223, 32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16 (1963); Comment, The Self-Incrimination Privilege: Barrier to Criminal Discovery?, 51 Calif.L.Rev. 135 (1963); Note, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 838 (1963). The courts in Jones v. Superior Court of Nevada County, supra, suggests that if mandatory disclosure applies only to those items which the accused intends to introduce in evidence at trial, neither the incriminatory nor the involuntary aspects of the privilege against self-incrimination are present.</p>
<p class="note-body">On balance the Advisory Committee is of the view that an independent right of discovery for both the defendant and the government is likely to contribute to both effective and fair administration. See Louisell, Criminal Discovery and Self-Incrimination: Roger Traynor Confronts the Dilemma, 53 Calif.L.Rev. 89 (1965), for an analysis of the difficulty of weighing the value of broad discovery against the value which inheres in not requiring the defendant to disclose anything which might work to his disadvantage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1)(A) provides that the defendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his possession, custody, or control and which he intends to introduce in evidence in his case in chief.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1)(B) provides that the defendant shall disclose the results of physical or mental exami<!-- PDFPage:73 -->nations and scientific tests or experiments if (a) they were made in connection with a particular case; (b) the defendant has them under his control; and (c) he intends to offer them in evidence in his case in chief or which were prepared by a defense witness and the results or reports relate to the witness's testimony. In cases where both prosecution and defense have employed experts to conduct tests such as psychiatric examinations, it seems as important for the government to be able to study the results reached by defense experts which are to be called by the defendant as it does for the defendant to study those of government experts. See Schultz, Criminal Discovery by the Prosecution: Frontier Developments and Some Proposals for the Future, 22 N.Y.U.Intra.L.Rev. 268 (1967); American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial &sect;3.2 (Supp., Approved Draft, 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1)(C) provides for discovery of a list of witnesses the defendant intends to call in his case in chief. State cases have indicated that disclosure of a list of defense witnesses does not violate the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. See <em>Jones v. Superior Court of Nevada County</em>, supra, and <em>People v. Lopez</em>, supra. The defendant has the same option as does the government if it is believed that disclosure of the identity of a witness may subject that witness to harm or a threat of harm. The defendant can ask for a protective order under subdivision (d)(1) or can take a deposition in accordance with the terms of rule 15.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is unchanged, appearing as the last sentence of subdivision (c) of old rule 16.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) provides that the defendant's failure to introduce evidence or call witnesses shall not be admissible in evidence against him. In states which require pretrial disclosure of witnesses&rsquo; identity, the prosecution is not allowed to comment upon the defendant's failure to call a listed witness. See <em>O'Connor v. State</em>, 31 Wis.2d 684, 143 N.W.2d 489 (1966); <em>People v. Mancini</em>, 6 N.Y.2d 853, 188 N.Y.S.2d 559, 160 N.E.2d 91 (1959); and <em>State v. Cocco</em>, 73 Ohio App. 182, 55 N.E.2d 430 (1943). This is not, however, intended to abrogate the government's right to comment generally upon the defendant's failure to call witnesses in an appropriate case, other than the defendant's failure to testify.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is a restatement of part of old rule 16(g).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(1) deals with the protective order. Although the rule does not attempt to indicate when a protective order should be entered, it is obvious that one would be appropriate where there is reason to believe that a witness would be subject to physical or economic harm if his identity is revealed. See <em>Will v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 90, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967). The language &ldquo;by the judge alone&rdquo; is not meant to be inconsistent with <em>Alderman v. United States</em>, 394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969). In <em>Alderman</em> the court points out that there may be appropriate occasions for the trial judge to decide questions relating to pretrial disclosure. See <em>Alderman v. United States</em>, 394 U.S. at 182 n. 14, 89 S.Ct. 961.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(2) is a restatement of part of old rule 16(g) and (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Old subdivision (f) of rule 16 dealing with time of motions is dropped because rule 12(c) provides the judge with authority to set the time for the making of pretrial motions including requests for discovery. Rule 12 also prescribes the consequences which follow from a failure to make a pretrial motion at the time fixed by the court. See rule 12(f).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regulates discovery by the defendant of evidence in possession of the prosecution, and discovery by the prosecution of evidence in possession of the defendant. The present rule permits the defendant to move the court to discover certain material. The prosecutor's discovery is limited and is reciprocal&mdash;that is, if the defendant is granted discovery of certain items, then the prosecution may move for discovery of similar items under the defendant's control.</p>
<p class="note-body">As proposed to be amended, the rule provides that the parties themselves will accomplish discovery&mdash;no motion need be filed and no court order is necessary. The court will intervene only to resolve a dispute as to whether something is discoverable or to issue a protective order.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed rule enlarges the scope of the defendant's discovery to include a copy of his prior criminal record and a list of the names and addresses, plus record of prior felony convictions, of all witnesses the prosecution intends to call during its case-in-chief. It also permits the defendant to discover the substance of any oral statement of his which the prosecution intends to offer at trial, if the statement was given in response to interrogation by any person known by defendant to be a government agent.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proposed subdivision (a)(2) provides that Rule 16 does not authorize the defendant to discover &ldquo;reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or other government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed rule also enlarges the scope of the government's discovery of materials in the custody of the defendant. The government is entitled to a list of the names and addresses of the witnesses the defendant intends to call during his case-in-chief. Proposed subdivision (b)(2) protects the defendant from having to disclose &ldquo;reports, memoranda, or other internal defense documents .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. made in connection with the investigation or defense of the case.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d)(1) of the proposed rule permits the court to deny, restrict, or defer discovery by either party, or to make such other order as is appropriate. Upon request, a party may make a showing that such an order is necessary. This showing shall be made to the judge alone if the party so requests. If the court enters an order after such a showing, it must seal the record of the showing and preserve it in the event there is an appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee agrees that the parties should, to the maximum possible extent, accomplish discovery themselves. The court should become involved only when it is necessary to resolve a dispute or to issue an order pursuant to subdivision (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Perhaps the most controversial amendments to this rule were those dealing with witness lists. Under present law, the government must turn over a witness list <em>only</em> in capital cases. [Section 3432 of title 18 of the United States Code provides: A person charged with treason or other capital offense shall at least three entire days before commencement of trial be furnished with a copy of the indictment and a list of the veniremen, and of the witnesses to be produced on the trial for proving the indictment, stating the place of abode of each venireman and witness.] The defendant never needs to turn over a list of his witnesses. The proposed rule requires both the government and the defendant to turn over witness lists in every case, capital or noncapital. Moreover, the lists must be furnished to the adversary party upon that party's request.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed rule was sharply criticized by both prosecutors and defenders. The prosecutors feared that pretrial disclosure of prosecution witnesses would result in harm to witnesses. The defenders argued that a defendant cannot constitutionally be compelled to disclose his witnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee believes that it is desirable to promote greater pretrial discovery. As stated in the Advisory Committee Note,</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;broader discovery by both the defense and the prosecution will contribute to the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice by aiding in informed plea negotiations, by minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise at trial, and by otherwise contributing to an accurate determination of the issue of guilt or innocence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:74 --><p class="note-body">The Committee, therefore, endorses the principle that witness lists are discoverable. However, the Committee has attempted to strike a balance between the narrow provisions of existing law and the broad provisions of the proposed rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee rule makes the procedures defendant-triggered. If the defendant asks for and receives a list of prosecution witnesses, then the prosecution may request a list of defense witnesses. The witness lists need not be turned over until 3 days before trial. The court can modify the terms of discovery upon a sufficient showing. Thus, the court can require disclosure of the witness lists earlier than 3 days before trial, or can permit a party not to disclose the identity of a witness before trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee provision promotes broader discovery and its attendant values&mdash;informed disposition of cases without trial, minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise, and helping insure that the issue of guilt or innocence is accurately determined. At the same time, it avoids the problems suggested by both the prosecutors and the defenders.</p>
<p class="note-body">The major argument advanced by prosecutors is the risk of danger to their witnesses if their identities are disclosed prior to trial. The Committee recognizes that there may be a risk but believes that the risk is not as great as some fear that it is. Numerous states require the prosecutor to provide the defendant with a list of prosecution witnesses prior to trial. [These States include Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah. See Advisory Committee Note, House Document 93&ndash;292, at 60.] The evidence before the Committee indicates that these states have not experienced unusual problems of witness intimidation. [See the comments of the Standing Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure of the State Bar of California in Hearings II, at 302.]</p>
<p class="note-body">Some federal jurisdictions have adopted an omnibus pretrial discovery procedure that calls upon the prosecutor to give the defendant its witness lists. One such jurisdiction is the Southern District of California. The evidence before the Committee indicates that there has been no unusual problems with witness intimidation in that district. Charles Sevilla, Chief Trial Attorney for the Federal Defenders of San Diego, Inc., which operates in the Southern District of California, testified as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The Government in one of its statements to this committee indicated that providing the defense with witness lists will cause coerced witness perjury. This does not happen. We receive Government witness lists as a matter of course in the Southern District, and it's a rare occasion when there is any overture by a defense witness or by a defendant to a Government witness. It simply doesn't happen except on the rarest of occasion. When the Government has that fear it can resort to the protective order. [Hearings II, at 42.]</p>
<p class="note-body">Mr. Sevilla's observations are corroborated by the views of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">Concerning the modifications to Rule 16, we have followed these procedures informally in this district for a number of years. We were one of the districts selected for the pilot projects of the Omnibus Hearing in 1967 or 1968. We have found that the courts in our district will not require us to disclose names of proposed witnesses when in our judgment to do so would not be advisable. Otherwise we routinely provide defense counsel with full discovery, including names and addresses of witnesses. We have not had any untoward results by following this program, having in mind that the courts will, and have, excused us from discovery where the circumstances warrant. [Hearings I, at 109.]</p>
<p class="note-body">Much of the prosecutorial criticism of requiring the prosecution to give a list of its witnesses to the defendant reflects an unwillingness to trust judges to exercise sound judgment in the public interest. Prosecutors have stated that they frequently will open their files to defendants in order to induce pleas. [See testimony of Richard L. Thornburgh, United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in Hearings I, at 150.]</p>
<p class="note-body">Prosecutors are willing to determine on their own when they can do this without jeopardizing the safety of witnesses. There is no reason why a judicial officer cannot exercise the same discretion in the public interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee is convinced that in the usual case there is no serious risk of danger to prosecution witnesses from pretrial disclosure of their identities. In exceptional instances, there may be a risk of danger. The Committee rule, however, is capable of dealing with those exceptional instances while still providing for disclosure of witnesses in the usual case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee recognizes the force of the constitutional arguments advanced by defenders. Requiring a defendant, upon request, to give to the prosecution material which may be incriminating, certainly raises very serious constitutional problems. The Committee deals with these problems by having the defendant trigger the discovery procedures. Since the defendant has no constitutional right to discover any of the prosecution's evidence (unless it is exculpatory within the meaning of <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)), it is permissible to condition his access to nonexculpatory evidence upon his turning over a list of defense witnesses. Rule 16 currently operates in this manner.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee also changed subdivisions (a)(2) and (b)(2), which set forth &ldquo;work product&rdquo; exceptions to the general discovery requirements. The subsections proposed by the Supreme Court are cast in terms of the type of document involved (e. g., report), rather than in terms of the content (e. g., legal theory). The Committee recast these provisions by adopting language from Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee notes that subdivision (a)(1)(C) permits the defendant to discover certain items that &ldquo;were obtained from or belong to the defendant.&rdquo; The Committee believes that, as indicated in the Advisory Committee Note [House Document 93&ndash;292, at 59], items that &ldquo;were obtained from or belong to the defendant&rdquo; are items that are material to the preparation of his defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added language to subdivision (a)(1)(B) to conform it to provisions in subdivision (a)(1)(A). The rule as changed by the Committee requires the prosecutor to give the defendant such copy of the defendant's prior criminal record as is within the prosecutor's &ldquo;possession, custody, or control, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known&rdquo; to the prosecutor. The Committee also made a similar conforming change in subdivision (a)(1)(E), dealing with the criminal records of government witnesses. The prosecutor can ordinarily discharge his obligation under these two subdivisions, (a)(1)(B) and (E), by obtaining a copy of the F.B.I. &ldquo;rap sheet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee made an additional change in subdivision (a)(1)(E). The proposed rule required the prosecutor to provide the defendant with a record of the felony convictions of government witnesses. The major purpose for letting the defendant discover information about the record of government witnesses, is to provide him with information concerning the credibility of those witnesses. Rule 609(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence permits a party to attack the credibility of a witness with convictions other than just felony convictions. The Committee, therefore, changed subdivision (a)(1)(E) to require the prosecutor to turn over a record of all criminal convictions, not just felony convictions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee changed subdivision (d)(1), which deals with protective orders. Proposed (d)(1) required the court to conduct an ex parte proceeding whenever a party so requested. The Committee changed the mandatory language to permissive language. A Court may, not must, conduct an ex parte proceeding if a party so <!-- PDFPage:75 -->requests. Thus, if a party requests a protective or modifying order and asks to make its showing ex parte, the court has two separate determinations to make. First, it must determine whether an ex parte proceeding is appropriate, bearing in mind that ex parte proceedings are disfavored and not to be encouraged. [An ex parte proceeding would seem to be appropriate if any adversary proceeding would defeat the purpose of the protective or modifying order. For example, the identity of a witness would be disclosed and the purpose of the protective order is to conceal that witness&rsquo; identity.] Second, it must determine whether a protective or modifying order shall issue.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Conference Committee Notes, House Report No. 94&ndash;414; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 16 deals with pretrial discovery by the defendant and the government. The House and Senate versions of the bill differ on Rule 16 in several respects.</p>
<p class="note-body">A. Reciprocal vs. Independent Discovery for the Government.&mdash;The House version of the bill provides that the government's discovery is reciprocal. If the defendant requires and receives certain items from the government, then the government is entitled to get similar items from the defendant. The Senate version of the bill gives the government an independent right to discover material in the possession of the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the House provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Rule 16(a)(1)(A).&mdash;The House version permits an organization to discover relevant recorded grand jury testimony of any witness who was, at the time of the acts charged or of the grand jury proceedings, so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind it in respect to the activities involved in the charges. The Senate version limits discovery of this material to testimony of a witness who was, at the time of the grand jury proceeding, so situated as an officer or employee as to have been legally to bind the defendant in respect to the activities involved in the charges.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conferees share a concern that during investigations, ex-employees and ex-officers of potential corporate defendants are a critical source of information regarding activities of their former corporate employers. It is not unusual that, at the time of their testimony or interview, these persons may have interests which are substantially adverse to or divergent from the putative corporate defendant. It is also not unusual that such individuals, though no longer sharing a community of interest with the corporation, may nevertheless be subject to pressure from their former employers. Such pressure may derive from the fact that the ex-employees or ex-officers have remained in the same industry or related industry, are employed by competitors, suppliers, or customers of their former employers, or have pension or other deferred compensation arrangements with former employers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conferees also recognize that considerations of fairness require that a defendant corporation or other legal entity be entitled to the grand jury testimony of a former officer or employee if that person was personally involved in the conduct constituting the offense and was able legally to bind the defendant in respect to the conduct in which he was involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conferees decided that, on balance, a defendant organization should not be entitled to the relevant grand jury testimony of a former officer or employee in every instance. However, a defendant organization should be entitled to it if the former officer or employee was personally involved in the alleged conduct constituting the offense and was so situated as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to the alleged conduct. The Conferees note that, even in those situations where the rule provides for disclosure of the testimony, the Government may, upon a sufficient showing, obtain a protective or modifying order pursuant to Rule 16(d)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts a provision that permits a defendant organization to discover relevant grant jury testimony of a witness who (1) was, at the time of his testimony, so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to conduct constituting the offense, or (2) was, at the time of the offense, personally involved in the alleged conduct constituting the offense and so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to that alleged conduct in which he was involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">C. Rules 16(a)(1)(E) and (b)(1)(C) (witness lists).&mdash;The House version of the bill provides that each party, the government and the defendant, may discover the names and addresses of the other party's witnesses 3 days before trial. The Senate version of the bill eliminates these provisions, thereby making the names and addresses of a party's witnesses nondiscoverable. The Senate version also makes a conforming change in Rule 16(d)(1). The Conference adopts the Senate version.</p>
<p class="note-body">A majority of the Conferees believe it is not in the interest of the effective administration of criminal justice to require that the government or the defendant be forced to reveal the names and addresses of its witnesses before trial. Discouragement of witnesses and improper contact directed at influencing their testimony, were deemed paramount concerns in the formulation of this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">D. Rules 16(a)(2) and (b)(2).&mdash;Rules 16(a)(2) and (b)(2) define certain types of materials (&ldquo;work product&rdquo;) not to be discoverable. The House version defines work product to be &ldquo;the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of the attorney for the government or other government agents.&rdquo; This is parallel to the definition in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Senate version returns to the Supreme Court's language and defines work product to be &ldquo;reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents.&rdquo; This is the language of the present rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conference adopts the Senate provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Conferees note that a party may not avoid a legitimate discovery request merely because something is labelled &ldquo;report&rdquo;, &ldquo;memorandum&rdquo;, or &ldquo;internal document&rdquo;. For example if a document qualifies as a statement of the defendant within the meaning of the Rule 16(a)(1)(A), then the labelling of that document as &ldquo;report&rdquo;, &ldquo;memorandum&rdquo;, or &ldquo;internal government document&rdquo; will not shield that statement from discovery. Likewise, if the results of an experiment qualify as the results of a scientific test within the meaning of Rule 16(b)(1)(B), then the results of that experiment are not shielded from discovery even if they are labelled &ldquo;report&rdquo;, &ldquo;memorandum&rdquo;, or &ldquo;internal defense document&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(3). The added language is made necessary by the addition of Rule 26.2 and new subdivision (i) of Rule 12, which contemplate the production of statements, including those made to a grand jury, under specified circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 16(a)(1)(A) expands slightly government disclosure to the defense of statements made by the defendant. The rule now requires the prosecution, upon request, to disclose any written record which contains reference to a relevant oral statement by the defendant which was in response to interrogation, without regard to whether the prosecution intends to use the statement at trial. The change recognizes that the defendant has some proprietary interest in statements made during interrogation regardless of the prosecution's intent to make any use of the statements.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:76 --><p class="note-body">The written record need not be a transcription or summary of the defendant's statement but must only be some written reference which would provide some means for the prosecution and defense to identify the statement. Otherwise, the prosecution would have the difficult task of locating and disclosing the myriad oral statements made by a defendant, even if it had no intention of using the statements at trial. In a lengthy and complicated investigation with multiple interrogations by different government agents, that task could become unduly burdensome.</p>
<p class="note-body">The existing requirement to disclose oral statements which the prosecution intends to introduce at trial has also been changed slightly. Under the amendment, the prosecution must also disclose any relevant oral statement which it intends to use at trial, without regard to whether it intends to introduce the statement. Thus, an oral statement by the defendant which would only be used for impeachment purposes would be covered by the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">The introductory language to the rule has been modified to clarify that without regard to whether the defendant's statement is oral or written, it must at a minimum be disclosed. Although the rule does not specify the means for disclosing the defendant's statements, if they are in written or recorded form, the defendant is entitled to inspect, copy, or photograph them.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">New subdivisions (a)(1)(E) and (b)(1)(C) expand federal criminal discovery by requiring disclosure of the intent to rely on expert opinion testimony, what the testimony will consist of, and the bases of the testimony. The amendment is intended to minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert's testimony through focused cross-examination. <em>See</em> Eads, <em>Adjudication by Ambush: Federal Prosecutors&rsquo; Use of Nonscientific Experts in a System of Limited Criminal Discovery</em>, 67 <em>N. C. L. Rev</em>. 577, 622 (1989).</p>
<p class="note-body">Like other provisions in Rule 16, subdivision (a)(1)(E) requires the government to disclose information regarding its expert witnesses if the defendant first requests the information. Once the requested information is provided, the government is entitled, under (b)(1)(C) to reciprocal discovery of the same information from the defendant. The disclosure is in the form of a written summary and only applies to expert witnesses that each side intends to call. Although no specific timing requirements are included, it is expected that the parties will make their requests and disclosures in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="note-body">With increased use of both scientific and nonscientific expert testimony, one of counsel's most basic discovery needs is to learn that an expert is expected to testify. <em>See</em> Gianelli, <em>Criminal Discovery, Scientific Evidence, and DNA</em>, 44 <em>Vand. L. Rev</em>. 793 (1991); <em>Symposium on Science and the Rules of Legal Procedure</em>, 101 F.R.D. 599 (1983). This is particularly important if the expert is expected to testify on matters which touch on new or controversial techniques or opinions. The amendment is intended to meet this need by first, requiring notice of the expert's qualifications which in turn will permit the requesting party to determine whether in fact the witness is an expert within the definition of Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Like Rule 702, which generally provides a broad definition of who qualifies as an &ldquo;expert,&rdquo; the amendment is broad in that it includes both scientific and nonscientific experts. It does not distinguish between those cases where the expert will be presenting testimony on novel scientific evidence. The rule does not extend, however, to witnesses who may offer only lay opinion testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 701. Nor does the amendment extend to summary witnesses who may testify under Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 unless the witness is called to offer expert opinions apart from, or in addition to, the summary evidence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, the requesting party is entitled to a summary of the expected testimony. This provision is intended to permit more complete pretrial preparation by the requesting party. For example, this should inform the requesting party whether the expert will be providing only background information on a particular issue or whether the witness will actually offer an opinion. In some instances, a generic description of the likely witness and that witness's qualifications may be sufficient, e.g., where a DEA laboratory chemist will testify, but it is not clear which particular chemist will be available.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, and perhaps most important, the requesting party is to be provided with a summary of the bases of the expert's opinion. Rule 16(a)(1)(D) covers disclosure and access to any results or reports of mental or physical examinations and scientific testing. But the fact that no formal written reports have been made does not necessarily mean that an expert will not testify at trial. At least one federal court has concluded that that provision did not otherwise require the government to disclose the identify of its expert witnesses where no reports had been prepared. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson</em>, 713 F.2d 654 (11th Cir. 1983, <em>cert. denied</em>, 484 U.S. 956 (1984) (there is no right to witness list and Rule 16 was not implicated because no reports were made in the case). The amendment should remedy that problem. Without regard to whether a party would be entitled to the underlying bases for expert testimony under other provisions of Rule 16, the amendment requires a summary of the bases relied upon by the expert. That should cover not only written and oral reports, tests, reports, and investigations, but any information that might be recognized as a legitimate basis for an opinion under Federal Rule of Evidence 703, including opinions of other experts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are not intended to create unreasonable procedural hurdles. As with other discovery requests under Rule 16, subdivision (d) is available to either side to seek ex parte a protective or modifying order concerning requests for information under (a)(1)(E) or (b)(1)(C).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is intended to clarify that the discovery and disclosure requirements of the rule apply equally to individual and organizational defendants. <em>See In re United States</em>, 918 F.2d 138 (11th Cir. 1990) (rejecting distinction between individual and organizational defendants). Because an organizational defendant may not know what its officers or agents have said or done in regard to a charged offense, it is important that it have access to statements made by persons whose statements or actions could be binding on the defendant. <em>See also United States v. Hughes</em>, 413 F.2d 1244, 1251&ndash;52 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>vacated as moot</em>, 397 U.S. 93 (1970) (prosecution of corporations &ldquo;often resembles the most complex civil cases, necessitating a vigorous probing of the mass of detailed facts to seek out the truth&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment defines defendant in a broad, nonexclusive fashion. <em>See also</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;18 (the term &ldquo;organization&rdquo; includes a person other than an individual). And the amendment recognizes that an organizational defendant could be bound by an agent's statement, <em>see, e.g</em>., Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2), or be vicariously liable for an agent's actions. The amendment contemplates that, upon request of the defendant, the Government will disclose any statements within the purview of the rule and made by persons whom the government contends to be among the classes of persons described in the rule. There is no requirement that the defense stipulate or admit that such persons were in a position to bind the defendant.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1997 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(1)(E)</em>. Under Rule 16(a)(1)(E), as amended in 1993, the defense is entitled to disclosure of cer<!-- PDFPage:77 -->tain information about expert witnesses which the government intends to call during the trial. And if the government provides that information, it is entitled to reciprocal discovery under (b)(1)(C). This amendment is a parallel reciprocal disclosure provision which is triggered by a government request for information concerning defense expert witnesses as to the defendant's mental condition, which is provided for in an amendment to (b)(1)(C), <em>infra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)(C)</em>. Amendments in 1993 to Rule 16 included provisions for pretrial disclosure of information, including names and expected testimony of both defense and government expert witnesses. Those disclosures are triggered by defense requests for the information. If the defense makes such requests and the government complies, the government is entitled to similar, reciprocal discovery. The amendment to Rule 16(b)(1)(C) provides that if the defendant has notified the government under Rule 12.2 of an intent to rely on expert testimony to show the defendant's mental condition, the government may request the defense to disclose information about its expert witnesses. Although Rule 12.2 insures that the government will not be surprised by the nature of the defense or that the defense intends to call an expert witness, that rule makes no provision for discovery of the identity, the expected testimony, or the qualifications of the expert witness. The amendment provides the government with the limited right to respond to the notice provided under Rule 12.2 by requesting more specific information about the expert. If the government requests the specified information, and the defense complies, the defense is entitled to reciprocal discovery under an amendment to subdivision (a)(1)(E), <em>supra.</em></p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>For Attendance of Witnesses; Form; Issuance</cap-smallcap>. A subpoena shall be issued by the clerk under the seal of the court. It shall state the name of the court and the title, if any, of the proceeding, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony at the time and place specified therein. The clerk shall issue a subpoena, signed and sealed but otherwise in blank to a party requesting it, who shall fill in the blanks before it is served. A subpoena shall be issued by a United States magistrate judge in a proceeding before that magistrate judge, but it need not be under the seal of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Defendants Unable to Pay</cap-smallcap>. The court shall order at any time that a subpoena be issued for service on a named witness upon an <em>ex parte</em> application of a defendant upon a satisfactory showing that the defendant is financially unable to pay the fees of the witness and that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense. If the court orders the subpoena to be issued the costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed shall be paid in the same manner in which similar costs and fees are paid in case of a witness subpoenaed in behalf of the government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>For Production of Documentary Evidence and of Objects</cap-smallcap>. A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce the books, papers, documents or other objects designated therein. The court on motion made promptly may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. The court may direct that books, papers, documents or objects designated in the subpoena be produced before the court at a time prior to the trial or prior to the time when they are to be offered in evidence and may upon their production permit the books, papers, documents or objects or portions thereof to be inspected by the parties and their attorneys.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Service</cap-smallcap>. A subpoena may be served by the marshal, by a deputy marshal or by any other person who is not a party and who is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to the person named and by tendering to that person the fee for 1 day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees and mileage need not be tendered to the witness upon service of a subpoena issued in behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Place of Service.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In United States</em>. A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a hearing or trial may be served at any place within the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Abroad</em>. A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country shall issue under the circumstances and in the manner and be served as provided in Title 28, U.S.C., &sect;1783.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>For Taking Deposition; Place of Examination.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Issuance</em>. An order to take a deposition authorizes the issuance by the clerk of the court for the district in which the deposition is to be taken of subpoenas for the persons named or described therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Place</em>. The witness whose deposition is to be taken may be required by subpoena to attend at any place designated by the trial court, taking into account the convenience of the witness and the parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:78 --><p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Contempt</cap-smallcap>. Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued or of the court for the district in which it issued if it was issued by a United States magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Information Not Subject to Subpoena</cap-smallcap>. Statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses may not be subpoenaed from the government or the defendant under this rule, but shall be subject to production only in accordance with the provisions of Rule 26.2.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This rule preserves the existing right of an indigent defendant to secure attendance of witnesses at the expense of the Government, 28 U.S.C. [former] 656 (Witnesses for indigent defendants). Under existing law, however, the right is limited to witnesses who are within the district in which the court is held or within one hundred miles of the place of trial. No procedure now exists whereby an indigent defendant can procure at Government expense the attendance of witnesses found in another district and more than 100 miles of the place of trial. This limitation is abrogated by the rule so that an indigent defendant will be able to secure the attendance of witnesses at the expense of the Government no matter where they are located. The showing required by the rule to justify such relief is the same as that now exacted by 28 U.S.C. [former] 656.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. The provision permitting persons other than the marshal to serve the subpoena, and requiring the payment of witness fees in Government cases is new matter.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(1). This rule continues existing law, 28 U.S.C. [former] 654 (Witnesses; subpoenas; may run into another district). The rule is different in civil cases in that in such cases, unless a statute otherwise provides, a subpoena may be served only within the district or within 100 miles of the place of trial, 28 U.S.C. [former] 654; Rule 45(e)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(2). This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. See <em>Blackmer v. United States</em>, 284 U.S. 421, upholding the validity of the statute referred to in the rule.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C, Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (g). This rule is substantially the same as Rule 45(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C, Appendix].</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1948 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is to substitute proper reference to Title 28 in place of the repealed act.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b).&mdash;Criticism has been directed at the requirement that an indigent defendant disclose in advance the theory of his defense in order to obtain the issuance of a subpoena at government expense while the government and defendants able to pay may have subpoenas issued in blank without any disclosure. See Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Criminal Justice (1963) p. 27. The Attorney General's Committee also urged that the standard of financial inability to pay be substituted for that of indigency. Id. at 40&ndash;41. In one case it was held that the affidavit filed by an indigent defendant under this subdivision could be used by the government at his trial for purposes of impeachment. <em>Smith v. United States</em>, 312 F.2d 867 (D.C.Cir. 1962). There has also been doubt as to whether the defendant need make a showing beyond the face of his affidavit in order to secure issuance of a subpoena. <em>Greenwell v. United States</em>, 317 F.2d 108 (D.C.Cir. 1963).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment makes several changes. The references to a judge are deleted since applications should be made to the court. An ex parte application followed by a satisfactory showing is substituted for the requirement of a request or motion supported by affidavit. The court is required to order the issuance of a subpoena upon finding that the defendant is unable to pay the witness fees and that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d).&mdash;The subdivision is revised to bring it into conformity with 28 U.S.C. &sect;1825.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivisions (a) and (g) are amended to reflect the existence of the &ldquo;United States magistrate,&rdquo; a phrase defined in rule 54.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f)(2) is amended to provide that the court has discretion over the place at which the deposition is to be taken. Similar authority is conferred by Civil Rule 45(d)(2). See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;278 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Ordinarily the deposition should be taken at the place most convenient for the witness but, under certain circumstances, the parties may prefer to arrange for the presence of the witness at a place more convenient to counsel.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with subpoenas. Subdivision (f)(2) as proposed by the Supreme Court provides:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The witness whose deposition is to be taken may be required by subpoena to attend at any place designated by the trial court.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee added language to the proposed amendment that directs the court to consider the convenience of the witness and the parties when compelling a witness to attend where a deposition will be taken.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (h). This addition to rule 17 is necessary in light of proposed rule 26.2, which deals with the obtaining of statements of government and defense witnesses.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section <!-- PDFPage:79 -->321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966</h4>
<p class="note-body">This new rule establishes a basis for pretrial conferences with counsel for the parties in criminal cases within the discretion of the court. Pretrial conferences are now being utilized to some extent even in the absence of a rule. See, generally, Brewster, Criminal Pre-Trials&mdash;Useful Techniques, 29 F.R.D. 442 (1962); Estes, Pre-Trial Conferences in Criminal Cases, 23 F.R.D. 560 (1959); Kaufman, Pre-Trial in Criminal Cases, 23 F.R.D. 551 (1959); Kaufman, Pre-Trial in Criminal Cases, 42 J.Am.Jud.Soc. 150 (1959); Kaufman, The Appalachian Trial: Further Observations on Pre-Trial in Criminal Cases, 44 J.Am.Jud.Soc. 53 (1960); West, Criminal Pre-Trials&mdash;Useful Techniques, 29 F.R.D. 436 (1962); Handbook of Recommended Procedures for the Trial of Protracted Cases, 25 F.R.D. 399&ndash;403, 468&ndash;470 (1960). Cf. Mo.Sup.Ct. Rule 25.09; Rules Governing the N.J. Courts, &sect;3:5&ndash;3.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule is cast in broad language so as to accommodate all types of pretrial conferences. As the third sentence suggests, in some cases it may be desirable or necessary to have the defendant present.
