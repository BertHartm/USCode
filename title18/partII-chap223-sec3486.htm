<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In any investigation relating to any act or activity involving a Federal health care offense, or any act or activity involving a Federal offense relating to the sexual exploitation or other abuse of children, the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee may issue in writing and cause to be served a subpoena&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requiring the production of any records (including any books, papers, documents, electronic media, or other objects or tangible things), which may be relevant to an authorized law enforcement inquiry, that a person or legal entity may possess or have care, custody, or control; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requiring a custodian of records to give testimony concerning the production and authentication of such records.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A subpoena under this subsection shall describe the objects required to be produced and prescribe a return date within a reasonable period of time within which the objects can be assembled and made available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The production of records shall not be required under this section at any place more than 500 miles distant from the place where the subpoena for the production of such records is served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Witnesses summoned under this section shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A subpoena issued under this section may be served by any person who is at least 18 years of age and is designated in the subpoena to serve it. Service upon a natural per<!-- PDFPage:597 -->son may be made by personal delivery of the subpoena to him. Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering the subpoena to an officer, to a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. The affidavit of the person serving the subpoena entered on a true copy thereof by the person serving it shall be proof of service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, the Attorney General may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the investigation is carried on or of which the subpoenaed person is an inhabitant, or in which he carries on business or may be found, to compel compliance with the subpoena. The court may issue an order requiring the subpoenaed person to appear before the Attorney General to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony concerning the production and authentication of such records. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in any judicial district in which such person may be found.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Immunity From Civil Liability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any Federal, State, or local law, any person, including officers, agents, and employees, receiving a summons under this section, who complies in good faith with the summons and thus produces the materials sought, shall not be liable in any court of any State or the United States to any customer or other person for such production or for nondisclosure of that production to the customer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Health information about an individual that is disclosed under this section may not be used in, or disclosed to any person for use in, any administrative, civil, or criminal action or investigation directed against the individual who is the subject of the information unless the action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to receipt of health care or payment for health care or action involving a fraudulent claim related to health; or if authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction, granted after application showing good cause therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In assessing good cause, the court shall weigh the public interest and the need for disclosure against the injury to the patient, to the physician-patient relationship, and to the treatment services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the granting of such order, the court, in determining the extent to which any disclosure of all or any part of any record is necessary, shall impose appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.</p>
