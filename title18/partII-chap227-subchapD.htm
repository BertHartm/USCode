<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Factors To Be Considered in Imposing a Term of Imprisonment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, in determining the length of the term, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation. In determining whether to make a recommendation concerning the type of prison facility appropriate for the defendant, the court shall consider any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Finality of Judgment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment can subsequently be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) modified pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) corrected pursuant to the provisions of rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) appealed and modified, if outside the guideline range, pursuant to the provisions of section 3742;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in any case&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3582_1_target" name="3582_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the defendant is at least 70 years of age, has served at least 30 years in prison, pursuant to a sentence imposed under section 3559(c), for the offense or offenses for which the defendant is currently imprisoned, and a determination has been made by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons that the defendant is not a danger to the safety of any other person or the community, as provided under section 3142(g);</p>

<!-- PDFPage:578 --><p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and that such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(<em>o</em>), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Inclusion of an Order To Limit Criminal Association of Organized Crime and Drug Offenders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment upon a defendant convicted of a felony set forth in chapter 95 (racketeering) or 96 (racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations) of this title or in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), or at any time thereafter upon motion by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons or a United States attorney, may include as a part of the sentence an order that requires that the defendant not associate or communicate with a specified person, other than his attorney, upon a showing of probable cause to believe that association or communication with such person is for the purpose of enabling the defendant to control, manage, direct, finance, or otherwise participate in an illegal enterprise.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3583. Inclusion of a term of supervised release after imprisonment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for a felony or a misdemeanor, may include as a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment, except that the court shall include as a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release if such a term is required by statute or if the defendant has been convicted for the first time of a domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authorized Terms of Supervised Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise provided, the authorized terms of supervised release are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for a Class A or Class B felony, not more than five years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for a Class C or Class D felony, not more than three years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for a Class E felony, or for a misdemeanor (other than a petty offense), not more than one year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Factors To Be Considered in Including a Term of Supervised Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in determining whether to include a term of supervised release, and, if a term of supervised release is to be included, in determining the length of the term and the conditions of supervised release, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Conditions of Supervised Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that the defendant not commit another Federal, State, or local crime during the term of supervision and that the defendant not unlawfully possess a controlled substance. The court shall order as an explicit condition of supervised release for a defendant convicted for the first time of a domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b) that the defendant attend a public, private, or private nonprofit offender rehabilitation program that has been approved by the court, in consultation with a State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or other appropriate experts, if an approved program is readily available within a 50-mile radius of the legal residence of the defendant. The court shall also order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to a drug test within 15 days of release on supervised release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled substance. The condition stated in the preceding sentence may be ameliorated or suspended by the court as provided in section 3563(a)(4).<sup><a href="#3583_1_target" name="3583_1">1</a></sup> The results of a drug test administered in accordance with the preceding subsection shall be subject to confirmation <!-- PDFPage:579 -->only if the results are positive, the defendant is subject to possible imprisonment for such failure, and either the defendant denies the accuracy of such test or there is some other reason to question the results of the test. A drug test confirmation shall be a urine drug test confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques or such test as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine to be of equivalent accuracy. The court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or an individual's current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines from the rule of section 3583(g) when considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test. The court may order, as a further condition of supervised release, to the extent that such condition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">any condition set forth as a discretionary condition of probation in section 3563(b)(1) through (b)(10) and (b)(12) through (b)(20), and any other condition it considers to be appropriate. If an alien defendant is subject to deportation, the court may provide, as a condition of supervised release, that he be deported and remain outside the United States, and may order that he be delivered to a duly authorized immigration official for such deportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Modification of Conditions or Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) terminate a term of supervised release and discharge the defendant released at any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation, if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) extend a term of supervised release if less than the maximum authorized term was previously imposed, and may modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of post-release supervision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable to revocation of probation or supervised release, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, except that a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony, more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a class C or D felony, or more than one year in any other case; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) order the defendant to remain at his place of residence during nonworking hours and, if the court so directs, to have compliance monitored by telephone or electronic signaling devices, except that an order under this paragraph may be imposed only as an alternative to incarceration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Written Statement of Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall direct that the probation officer provide the defendant with a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the term of supervised release is subject, and that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory Revocation for Possession of Controlled Substance or Firearm or for Refusal To Comply With Drug Testing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) possesses a controlled substance in violation of the condition set forth in subsection (d);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) possesses a firearm, as such term is defined in section 921 of this title, in violation of Federal law, or otherwise violates a condition of supervised release prohibiting the defendant from possessing a firearm; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) refuses to comply with drug testing imposed as a condition of supervised release;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the court shall revoke the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Supervised Release Following Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment that is less than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3), the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Delayed Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The power of the court to revoke a term of supervised release for violation of a condition of supervised release, and to order the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment and, subject to the limitations in subsection (h), a further term of supervised release, extends beyond the expiration of the term <!-- PDFPage:580 -->of supervised release for any period reasonably necessary for the adjudication of matters arising before its expiration if, before its expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an allegation of such a violation.</p>
