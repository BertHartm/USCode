<!-- PDFPage:110 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 18 U.S.C. &sect;3593(c) or another statute requires otherwise; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Time to Disclose.</em> Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report to the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found guilty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Minimum Required Notice.</em> The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Sentence Recommendation.</em> By local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Objecting to the Report.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Time to Object.</em> Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections, including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Serving Objections.</em> An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Action on Objections.</em> After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties to discuss the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Submitting the Report.</cap-smallcap> At least 7 days before sentencing, the probation officer must submit to the court and to the parties the presentence report and an addendum containing any unresolved objections, the grounds for those objections, and the probation officer's comments on them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Notice of Possible Departure from Sentencing Guidelines.</cap-smallcap> Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Sentencing.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> At sentencing, the court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of&mdash;or summarize in camera&mdash;any information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:111 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) must allow the parties&rsquo; attorneys to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) may, for good cause, allow a party to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. </em>The court may permit the parties to introduce evidence on the objections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)&ndash;(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Court Determinations.</em> At sentencing, the court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) must&mdash;for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter&mdash;rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made available to the Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Opportunity to Speak.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>By a Party.</em> Before imposing sentence, the court must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provide the defendant's attorney an opportunity to speak on the defendant's behalf;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provide an attorney for the government an opportunity to speak equivalent to that of the defendant's attorney.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>By a Victim.</em> Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of the crime who is present at sentencing and must permit the victim to be reasonably heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>In Camera Proceedings</em>. Upon a party's motion and for good cause, the court may hear in camera any statement made under Rule 32(i)(4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Defendant's Right to Appeal.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Advice of a Right to Appeal.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Appealing a Conviction</em>. If the defendant pleaded not guilty and was convicted, after sentencing the court must advise the defendant of the right to appeal the conviction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Appealing a Sentence</em>. After sentencing&mdash;regardless of the defendant's plea&mdash;the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Appeal Costs</em>. The court must advise a defendant who is unable to pay appeal costs of the right to ask for permission to appeal in forma pauperis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)<em>Clerk's Filing of Notice.</em> If the defendant so requests, the clerk must immediately prepare and file a notice of appeal on the defendant's behalf.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Judgment.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> In the judgment of conviction, the court must set forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court's findings, the adjudication, and the sentence. If the defendant is found not guilty or is otherwise entitled to be discharged, the court must so order. The judge must sign the judgment, and the clerk must enter it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Criminal Forfeiture.</em> Forfeiture procedures are governed by Rule 32.2.</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1).&mdash;The amendment writes into the rule the holding of the Supreme Court that the court before imposing sentence must afford an opportunity to the defendant personally to speak in his own behalf. See <em>Green v. United States</em>, 365 U.S. 301 (1961); <em>Hill v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 424 (1962). The amendment also provides an opportunity for counsel to speak on behalf of the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(2).&mdash;This amendment is a substantial revision and a relocation of the provision originally found in Rule 37(a)(2): &ldquo;When a court after trial imposes sentence upon a defendant not represented by counsel, the defendant shall be advised of his right to appeal and if he so requests, the clerk shall prepare and file forthwith a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant.&rdquo; The court is required to advise the defendant of his right to appeal in all cases which have gone to trial after plea of not guilty because situations arise in which a defendant represented by counsel at the trial is not adequately advised by such counsel of his right to appeal. Trial counsel may not regard his responsibility as extending beyond the time of imposition of sentence. <!-- PDFPage:112 -->The defendant may be removed from the courtroom immediately upon sentence and held in custody under circumstances which make it difficult for counsel to advise him. See, e.g., <em>Hodges v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 139 (1961). Because indigent defendants are most likely to be without effective assistance of counsel at this point in the proceedings, it is also provided that defendants be notified of the right of a person without funds to apply for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The provision is added here because this rule seems the most appropriate place to set forth a procedure to be followed by the court at the time of sentencing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(2).&mdash;It is not a denial of due process of law for a court in sentencing to rely on a report of a presentence investigation without disclosing such report to the defendant or giving him an opportunity to rebut it. <em>Williams v. New York</em>, 337 U.S. 241 (1949); <em>Williams v. Oklahoma</em>, 358 U.S. 576 (1959). However, the question whether as a matter of policy the defendant should be accorded some opportunity to see and refute allegations made in such reports has been the subject of heated controversy. For arguments favoring disclosure, see Tappan, Crime, Justice, and Correction, 558 (1960); Model Penal Code, 54&ndash;55 (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1954); Thomsen, Confidentiality of the Presentence Report: A Middle Position, 28 Fed.Prob., March 1964, p. 8; Wyzanski, A Trial Judge's Freedom and Responsibility, 65 Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1291&ndash;2 (1952); Note, Employment of Social Investigation Reports in Criminal and Juvenile Proceedings, 58 Colum.L.Rev. 702 (1958); cf. Kadish, The Advocate and the Expert: Counsel in the Peno-Correctional Process, 45 Minn.L.Rev. 803, 806, (1961). For arguments opposing disclosure, see Barnett and Gronewold, Confidentiality of the Presentence Report, 26 Fed.Prob. March 1962, p. 26; Judicial Conference Committee on Administration of the Probation System, Judicial Opinion on Proposed Change in Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure&mdash;a Survey (1964); Keve, The Probation Officer Investigates, 6&ndash;15 (1960); Parsons, The Presentence Investigation Report Must be Preserved as a Confidential Document, 28 Fed.Prob. March 1964, p. 3; Sharp, The Confidential Nature of Presentence Reports, 5 Cath.U.L.Rev. 127 (1955); Wilson, A New Arena is Emerging to Test the Confidentiality of Presentence Reports, 25 Fed.Prob. Dec. 1961, p. 6; Federal Judge's Views on Probation Practices, 24 Fed.Prob. March 1960, p. 10.</p>
<p class="note-body">In a few jurisdictions the defendant is given a right of access to the presentence report. In England and California a copy of the report is given to the defendant in every case. English Criminal Justice Act of 1948, 11 & 12 Geo. 6, c. 58, &sect;43; Cal.Pen.C. &sect;1203. In Alabama the defendant has a right to inspect the report. Ala. Code, Title 42, &sect;23. In Ohio and Virginia the probation officer reports in open court and the defendant is given the right to examine him on his report. Ohio Rev. Code, &sect;2947.06; Va. Code, &sect;53&ndash;278.1. The Minnesota Criminal Code of 1963, &sect;609.115(4), provides that any presentence report &ldquo;shall be open for inspection by the prosecuting attorney and the defendant's attorney prior to sentence and on the request of either of them a summary hearing in chambers shall be held on any matter brought in issue, but confidential sources of information shall not be disclosed unless the court otherwise directs.&rdquo; Cf. Model Penal Code &sect;7.07(5) (P.O.D. 1962): &ldquo;Before imposing sentence, the Court shall advise the defendant or his counsel of the factual contents and the conclusions of any presentence investigation or psychiatric examination and afford fair opportunity, if the defendant so requests, to controvert them. The sources of confidential information need not, however, be disclosed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Practice in the federal courts is mixed, with a substantial minority of judges permitting disclosure while most deny it. See the recent survey prepared for the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia by the Junior Bar Section of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia, reported in Conference Papers on Discovery in Federal Criminal Cases, 33 F.R.D. 101, 125&ndash;127 (1963). See also Gronewold, Presentence Investigation Practices in the Federal Probation System, Fed.Prob. Sept. 1958, pp. 27, 31. For divergent judicial opinions see <em>Smith v. United States</em>, 223 F.2d 750, 754 (5th Cir. 1955) (supporting disclosure); <em>United States v. Durham</em>, 181 F.Supp. 503 (D.D.C. 1960) (supporting secrecy).</p>
<p class="note-body">Substantial objections to compelling disclosure in every case have been advanced by federal judges, including many who in practice often disclose all or parts of presentence reports. See Judicial Conference Committee on the Administration of the Probation System, Judicial Opinion on Proposed Change in Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure&mdash;A Survey (1964). Hence, the amendment goes no further than to make it clear that courts may disclose all or part of the presentence report to the defendant or to his counsel. It is hoped that courts will make increasing use of their discretion to disclose so that defendants generally may be given full opportunity to rebut or explain facts in presentence reports which will be material factors in determining sentences. For a description of such a practice in one district, see Thomsen, Confidentiality of the Presentence Report: A Middle Position, 28 Fed.Prob., March 1964, p. 8.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is also provided that any material disclosed to the defendant or his counsel shall be disclosed to the attorney for the government. Such disclosure will permit the government to participate in the resolution of any factual questions raised by the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f).&mdash;This new subdivision writes into the rule the procedure which the cases have derived from the provision in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653 that a person arrested for violation of probation &ldquo;shall be taken before the court&rdquo; and that thereupon the court may revoke the probation. See <em>Escoe v. Zerbst</em>, 295 U.S. 490 (1935); <em>Brown v. United States</em>, 236 F.2d 253 (9th Cir. 1956) certiorari denied 356 U.S. 922 (1958). Compare Model Penal Code &sect;301.4 (P.O.D. 1962); Hink, The Application of Constitutional Standards of Protection to Probation, 29 U.Chi.L.Rev. 483 (1962).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is new. It is intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provisions of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title IX, &sect;1963, and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II, &sect;408(a)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">18 U.S.C. &sect;1963(c) provides for property seizure and disposition. In part it states:</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Upon conviction of a person under this section, the court shall authorize the Attorney General to seize all property or other interest declared forfeited under this section upon such terms and conditions as the court shall deem proper.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although not specifically provided for in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, the provision of Title II, &sect;408(a)(2) forfeiting &ldquo;profits&rdquo; or &ldquo;interest&rdquo; will need to be implemented procedurally, and therefore new rule 32(b)(2) will be applicable also to that legislation.</p>
<p class="note-body">For a brief discussion of the procedural implications of a criminal forfeiture, see Advisory Committee Note to rule 7(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1) is amended by deleting the reference to commitment or release pending sentencing. This issue is dealt with explicitly in the proposed revision of rule 46(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(2) is amended to make clear that there is no duty on the court to advise the defendant of the right to appeal after sentence is imposed following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.</p>
<p class="note-body">To require the court to advise the defendant of a right to appeal after a plea of guilty, accepted pursuant to the increasingly stringent requirements of rule 11, is likely to be confusing to the defendant. See American Bar Association Standards Relating to Criminal Ap<!-- PDFPage:113 -->peals &sect;2.1(b) (Approved Draft, 1970), limiting the court's duty to advice to &ldquo;contested cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that such advice, following a sentence imposed after a plea of guilty, will merely tend to build false hopes and encourage frivolous appeals, with the attendant expense to the defendant or the taxpayers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former rule 32(a)(2) imposes a duty only upon conviction after &ldquo;trial on a plea of not guilty.&rdquo; The few federal cases dealing with the question have interpreted rule 32(a)(2) to say that the court has no duty to advise defendant of his right to appeal after conviction following a guilty plea. <em>Burton v.

United States</em>, 397 F.2d 284, 285 (10th Cir. 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">Prior to the 1966 amendment of rule 32, the court's duty was even more limited. At that time [rule 37(a)(2)] the court's duty to advise was limited to those situations in which sentence was imposed after trial upon a not guilty plea of a defendant not represented by counsel. 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;32.01[3] (2d ed. Cipes 1969); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;528 (1969); 5 L. Orfield, Criminal Procedure Under the Federal Rules &sect;32:11 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">With respect to appeals in forma pauperis, see appellate rule 24.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(1) makes clear that a presentence report is required except when the court otherwise directs for reasons stated of record. The requirement of reasons on the record for not having a presentence report is intended to make clear that such a report ought to be routinely required except in cases where there is a reason for not doing so. The presentence report is of great value for correctional purposes and will serve as a valuable aid in reviewing sentences to the extent that sentence review may be authorized by future rule change. For an analysis of the current rule as it relates to the situation in which a presentence investigation is required, see C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;522 (1969); 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice  32.03[1] (2d ed. Cipes 1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(1) is also changed to permit the judge, after obtaining defendant's consent, to see the presentence report in order to decide whether to accept a plea agreement, and also to expedite the imposition of sentence in a case in which the defendant has indicated that he may plead guilty or nolo contendere.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former subdivision (c)(1) provides that &ldquo;The report shall not be submitted to the court *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* unless the defendant has pleaded guilty *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; This precludes a judge from seeing a presentence report prior to the acceptance of the plea of guilty. L. Orfield, Criminal Procedure Under the Federal Rules &sect;32:35 (1967); 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;32.03[2], p. 32&ndash;22 (2d ed. Cipes 1969); C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;523, p. 392 (1969); <em>Gregg v. United States</em>, 394 U.S. 489, 89 S.Ct. 1134, 22 L.Ed.2d 442 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because many plea agreements will deal with the sentence to be imposed, it will be important, under rule 11, for the judge to have access to sentencing information as a basis for deciding whether the plea agreement is an appropriate one.</p>
<p class="note-body">It has been suggested that the problem be dealt with by allowing the judge to indicate approval of the plea agreement subject to the condition that the information in the presentence report is consistent with what he has been told about the case by counsel. See American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;3.3 (Approved Draft, 1963); President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 136 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">Allowing the judge to see the presentence report prior to his decision as to whether to accept the plea agreement is, in the view of the Advisory Committee, preferable to a conditional acceptance of the plea. See Enker, Perspectives on Plea Bargaining, Appendix A of President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Courts at 117 (1967). It enables the judge to have all of the information available to him at the time he is called upon to decide whether or not to accept the plea of guilty and thus avoids the necessity of a subsequent appearance whenever the information is such that the judge decides to reject the plea agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is presently authority to have a presentence report <em>prepared</em> prior to the acceptance of the plea of guilty. In <em>Gregg v. United States</em>, 394 U.S. 489, 491, 89 S.Ct. 1134 22 L.Ed.2d 442 (1969), the court said that the &ldquo;language [of rule 32] clearly permits the preparation of a presentence report before guilty plea or conviction *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo; In footnote 3 the court said:</p>
<p class="note-body">The history of the rule confirms this interpretation. The first Preliminary Draft of the rule would have required the consent of the defendant or his attorney to commence the investigation before the determination of guilt. Advisory Committee on Rules of Criminal Procedure, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., Preliminary Draft 130, 133 (1943). The Second Preliminary Draft omitted this requirement and imposed no limitation on the time when the report could be made and submitted to the court. Advisory Committee on Rules of Criminal Procedure, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. Second Preliminary Draft 126&ndash;128 (1944). The third and final draft, which was adopted as Rule 32, was evidently a compromise between those who opposed any time limitation, and those who preferred that the entire investigation be conducted after determination of guilt. See 5 L. Orfield, Criminal Procedure Under the Federal Rules &sect;32.2 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">Where the judge rejects the plea agreement after seeing the presentence report, he should be free to recuse himself from later presiding over the trial of the case. This is left to the discretion of the judge. There are instances involving prior convictions where a judge may have seen a presentence report, yet can properly try a case on a plea of not guilty. <em>Webster v. United States</em>, 330 F.Supp. 1080 (D.C., 1971). Unlike the situation in <em>Gregg v. United States</em>, subdivision (e)(3) provides for disclosure of the presentence report to the defendant, and this will enable counsel to know whether the information thus made available to the judge is likely to be prejudicial. Presently trial judges who decide pretrial motions to suppress illegally obtained evidence are not, for that reason alone, precluded from presiding at a later trial.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(3)(A) requires disclosure of presentence information to the defense, exclusive of any recommendation of sentence. The court is required to disclose the report to defendant or his counsel unless the court is of the opinion that disclosure would seriously interfere with rehabilitation, compromise confidentiality, or create risk of harm to the defendant or others.</p>
<p class="note-body">Any recommendation as to sentence should not be disclosed as it may impair the effectiveness of the probation officer if the defendant is under supervision on probation or parole.</p>
<p class="note-body">The issue of disclosure of presentence information to the defense has been the subject of recommendations from the Advisory Committee in 1944, 1962, 1964, and 1966. The history is dealt with in considerable detail in C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;524 (1969), and 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;32.03[4] (2d ed. Cipes 1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">In recent years, three prestigious organizations have recommended that the report be disclosed to the defense. See American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures &sect;4.4 (Approved Draft, 1968); American Law Institute Model Penal Code &sect;7.07(5) (P.O.D. 1962); National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Model Sentencing Act &sect;4 (1963). This is also the recommendation of the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society (1967) at p. 145.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the absence of compelling reasons for nondisclosure of special information, the defendant and his counsel should be permitted to examine the entire presentence report.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:114 --><p class="note-body">The arguments for and against disclosure are well known and are effectively set forth in American Bar Association Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, &sect;4.4 Commentary at pp. 214&ndash;225 (Approved Draft, 1968). See also Lehrich, The Use and Disclosure of Presentence Reports in the United States, 47 F.R.D. 225 (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">A careful account of existing practices in Detroit, Michigan and Milwaukee, Wisconsin is found in R. Dawson, Sentencing (1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Most members of the federal judiciary have, in the past, opposed compulsory disclosure. See the view of District Judge Edwin M. Stanley, American Bar Association Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures. Appendix A. (Appendix A also contains the results of a survey of all federal judges showing that the clear majority opposed disclosure.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee is of the view that accuracy of sentencing information is important not only to the defendant but also to effective correctional treatment of a convicted offender. The best way of insuring accuracy is disclosure with an opportunity for the defendant and counsel to point out to the court information thought by the defense to be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise misleading. Experience in jurisdictions which require disclosure does not lend support to the argument that disclosure will result in less complete presentence reports or the argument that sentencing procedures will become unnecessarily protracted. It is not intended that the probation officer would be subjected to any rigorous examination by defense counsel, or that he will even be sworn to testify. The proceedings may be very informal in nature unless the court orders a full hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(3)(B) provides for situations in which the sentencing judge believes that disclosure should not be made under the criteria set forth in subdivision (c)(3)(A). He may disclose only a summary of that factual information &ldquo;to be relied on in determining sentence.&rdquo; This is similar to the proposal of the American Bar Association Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures &sect;4.4(b) and Commentary at pp. 216&ndash;224.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(3)(D) provides for the return of disclosed presentence reports to insure that they do not become available to unauthorized persons. See National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Model Sentencing Act &sect;4 (1963): &ldquo;Such reports shall be part of the record but shall be sealed and opened only on order of the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(3)(E) makes clear that diagnostic studies under 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;4208(b), 5010(c), or 5034 are covered by this rule and also that 18 U.S.C. &sect;4252 is included within the disclosure provisions of subdivision (c). Section 4252 provides for the presentence examination of an &ldquo;eligible offender&rdquo; who is believed to be an addict to determine whether &ldquo;he is an addict and is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Both the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 [&sect;3775(b)] and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 [&sect;409(b)] have special provisions for presentence investigation in the implementation of the dangerous special offender provision. It is however, unnecessary to incorporate them by reference in rule 32 because each contains a specific provision requiring disclosure of the presentence report. The judge does have authority to withhold some information &ldquo;in extraordinary cases&rdquo; provided notice is given the parties and the court's reasons for withholding information are made part of the record.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e) is amended to clarify the meaning.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deals with sentencing matters.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proposed subdivision (a)(2) provides that the court is not dutybound to advise the defendant of a right to appeal when the sentence is imposed following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proposed subdivision (e) provides that the probation service must make a presentence investigation and report unless the court orders otherwise &ldquo;for reasons stated on the record.&rdquo; The presentence report will not be submitted to the court until after the defendant pleads nolo contendere or guilty, or is found guilty, unless the defendant consents in writing. Upon the defendant's request, the court must permit the defendant to read the presentence report, except for the recommendation as to sentence. However, the court may decline to let the defendant read the report if it contains (a) diagnostic opinion that might seriously disrupt a rehabilitation program, (b) sources of information obtained upon a promise of confidentiality, or (c) any other information that, if disclosed, might result in harm to the defendant or other persons. The court must give the defendant an opportunity to comment upon the presentence report. If the court decides that the defendant should not see the report, then it must provide the defendant, orally or in writing, a summary of the factual information in the report upon which it is relying in determining sentence. No party may keep the report or make copies of it.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. The Committee added language to subdivision (a)(1) to provide that the attorney for the government may speak to the court at the time of sentencing. The language does not require that the attorney for the government speak but permits him to do so if he wishes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee recast the language of subdivision (c)(1), which defines when presentence reports must be obtained. The Committee's provision makes it more difficult to dispense with a presentence report. It requires that a presentence report be made unless (a) the defendant waives it, or (b) the court finds that the record contains sufficient information to enable the meaningful exercise of sentencing discretion and explains this finding on the record. The Committee believes that presentence reports are important aids to sentencing and should not be dispensed with easily.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added language to subdivision (c)(3)(A) that permits a defendant to offer testimony or information to rebut alleged factual inaccuracies in the presentence report. Since the presentence report is to be used by the court in imposing sentence and since the consequence of any significant inaccuracy can be very serious to the defendant, the Committee believes that it is essential that the presentence report be completely accurate in every material respect. The Committee's addition to subdivision (c)(3)(A) will help insure the accuracy of the presentence report.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added language to subdivision (c)(3)(D) that gives the court the discretion to permit either the prosecutor or the defense counsel to retain a copy of the presentence report. There may be situations when it would be appropriate for either or both of the parties to retain the presentence report. The Committee believes that the rule should give the court the discretion in such situations to permit the parties to retain their copies.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(3)(E). The amendment to rule 32(c)(3)(E) is necessary in light of recent changes in the applicable statutes.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). This subdivision is abrogated. The subject matter is now dealt with in greater detail in proposed new rule 32.1.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(1). Subdivision (a)(1) has been amended so as to impose upon the sentencing court the additional obligation of determining that the defendant and his counsel have had an opportunity to read the presentence investigation report or summary thereof. This change is consistent with the amendment of subdivision (c)(3), discussed below, providing for disclosure <!-- PDFPage:115 -->of the report (or, in the circumstances indicated, a summary thereof) to <em>both</em> defendant <em>and</em> his counsel <em>without request</em>. This amendment is also consistent with the findings of a recent empirical study that under present rule 32 meaningful disclosure is often lacking and &ldquo;that some form of judicial prodding is necessary to achieve full disclosure.&rdquo; Fennell & Hall, <em>Due Process at Sentencing: An Empirical and Legal Analysis of the Disclosure of Presentence Reports in Federal Courts</em>, 93 Harv.L.Rev. 1613, 1651 (1980):</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The defendant's interest in an accurate and reliable presentence report does not cease with the imposition of sentence. Rather, these interests are implicated at later stages in the correctional process by the continued use of the presentence report as a basic source of information in the handling of the defendant. If the defendant is incarcerated, the presentence report accompanies him to the correctional institution and provides background information for the Bureau of Prisons&rsquo; classification summary, which, in turn, determines the defendant's classification within the facility, his ability to obtain furloughs, and the choice of treatment programs. The presentence report also plays a crucial role during parole determination. Section 4207 of the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act directs the parole hearing examiner to consider, if available, the presentence report as well as other records concerning the prisoner. In addition to its general use as background at the parole hearing, the presentence report serves as the primary source of information for calculating the inmate's parole guideline score.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Though it is thus important that the defendant be aware <em>now</em> of all these potential uses, the Advisory Committee has considered but not adopted a requirement that the trial judge specifically advise the defendant of these matters. The Committee believes that this additional burden should not be placed upon the trial judge, and that the problem is best dealt with by a form attached to the presentence report, to be signed by the defendant, advising of these potential uses of the report. This suggestion has been forwarded to the Probation Committee of the Judicial Conference.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(3)(A), (B) & (C). Three important changes are made in subdivision (c)(3): disclosure of the presentence report is no longer limited to those situations in which a request is made; disclosure is now provided to both defendant and his counsel; and disclosure is now required a reasonable time before sentencing. These changes have been prompted by findings in a recent empirical study that the extent and nature of disclosure of the presentence investigation report in federal courts under current rule 32 is insufficient to ensure accuracy of sentencing information. In 14 districts, disclosure is made only on request, and such requests are received in fewer than 50% of the cases. Forty-two of 92 probation offices do not provide automatic notice to defendant or counsel of the availability of the report; in 18 districts, a majority of the judges do not provide any notice of the availability of the report, and in 20 districts such notice is given only on the day of sentencing. In 28 districts, the report itself is not disclosed until the day of sentencing in a majority of cases. Thirty-one courts generally disclose the report only to counsel and not to the defendant, unless the defendant makes a specific request. Only 13 districts disclose the presentence report to both defendant and counsel prior to the day of sentencing in 90% or more of the cases. Fennell & Hall, supra, at 1640&ndash;49.</p>
<p class="note-body">These findings make it clear that rule 32 in its present form is failing to fulfill its purpose. Unless disclosure is made sufficiently in advance of sentencing to permit the assertion and resolution of claims of inaccuracy prior to the sentencing hearing, the submission of additional information by the defendant when appropriate, and informed comment on the presentence report, the purpose of promoting accuracy by permitting the defendant to contest erroneous information is defeated. Similarly, if the report is not made available to the defendant and his counsel in a timely fashion, and if disclosure is only made on request, their opportunity to review the report may be inadequate. Finally, the failure to disclose the report to the defendant, or to require counsel to review the report with the defendant, significantly reduces the likelihood that false statements will be discovered, as much of the content of the presentence report will ordinarily be outside the knowledge of counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">The additional change to subdivision (c)(3)(C) is intended to make it clear that the government's right to disclosure does not depend upon whether the defendant elects to exercise his right to disclosure.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(3)(D). Subdivision (c)(3)(D) is entirely new. It requires the sentencing court, as to each matter controverted, either to make a finding as to the accuracy of the challenged factual proposition or to determine that no reliance will be placed on that proposition at the time of sentencing. This new provision also requires that a record of this action accompany any copy of the report later made available to the Bureau of Prisons or Parole Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">As noted above, the Bureau of Prisons and the Parole Commission make substantial use of the presentence investigation report. Under current practice, this can result in reliance upon assertions of fact in the report in the making of critical determinations relating to custody or parole. For example, it is possible that the Bureau or Commission, in the course of reaching a decision on such matters as institution assignment, eligibility for programs, or computation of salient factors, will place great reliance upon factual assertions in the report which are in fact untrue and which remained unchallenged at the time of the sentencing because defendant or his counsel deemed the error unimportant in the sentencing context (e.g., where the sentence was expected to conform to an earlier plea agreement, or where the judge said he would disregard certain controverted matter in setting the sentence).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of new subdivision (c)(3)(D) is intended to ensure that a record is made as to exactly what resolution occurred as to controverted matter. The second sentence is intended to ensure that this record comes to the attention of the Bureau or Commission when these agencies utilize the presentence investigation report. In current practice, &ldquo;less than one-fourth of the district courts (twenty of ninety-two) communicate to the correctional agencies the defendant's challenges to information in the presentence report and the resolution of these challenges.&rdquo; Fennell & Hall, supra, at 1680.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (c)(3)(D) does not impose an onerous burden. It does not even require the preparation of a transcript. As is now the practice in some courts, these findings and determinations can be simply entered onto a form which is then appended to the report.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c)(3)(E) & (F). Former subdivisions (c)(3)(D) and (E) have been renumbered as (c)(3)(E) and (F). The only change is in the former, necessitated because disclosure is now to defendant and his counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">The issue of access to the presentence report at the institution was discussed by the Advisory Committee, but no action was taken on that matter because it was believed to be beyond the scope of the rule-making power. Rule 32 in its present form does not speak to this issue, and thus the Bureau of Prisons and the Parole Commission are free to make provision for disclosure to inmates and their counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). The amendment to Rule 32(d) is intended to clarify (i) the standard applicable to plea withdrawal under this rule, and (ii) the circumstances under which the appropriate avenue of relief is other than a withdrawal motion under this rule. Both of these matters have been the source of considerable confusion under the present rule. In its present form, the rule declares that a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere may be made only before sentence is imposed, but then states the standard for permitting withdrawal after sentence. In fact, &ldquo;there is no limitation upon the time within which relief thereunder may, <!-- PDFPage:116 -->after sentencing, be sought.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Watson</em>, 548 F.2d 1058 (D.C.Cir. 1977). It has been critically stated that &ldquo;the Rule offers little guidance as to the applicable standard for a pre-sentence withdrawal of plea,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Michaelson</em>, 552 F.2d 472 (2d Cir. 1977), and that as a result &ldquo;the contours of [the presentence] standard are not easily defined.&rdquo; <em>Bruce v. United States</em>, 379 F.2d 113 (D.C.Cir. 1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">By replacing the &ldquo;manifest injustice&rdquo; standard with a requirement that, in cases to which it applied, the defendant must (unless taking a direct appeal) proceed under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255, the amendment avoids language which has been a cause of unnecessary confusion. Under the amendment, a defendant who proceeds too late to come under the more generous &ldquo;fair and just reason&rdquo; standard must seek relief under &sect;2255, meaning the applicable standard is that stated in <em>Hill v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 424 (1962): &ldquo;a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice&rdquo; or &ldquo;an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Some authority is to be found to the effect that the rule 32(d) &ldquo;manifest injustice&rdquo; standard is indistinguishable from the &sect;2255 standard. In <em>United States v. Hamilton</em>, 553 F.2d 63 (10th Cir. 1977), for example, the court, after first concluding defendant was not entitled to relief under the &sect;2255 &ldquo;miscarriage of justice&rdquo; test, then held that &ldquo;[n]othing is to be gained by the invocation of Rule 32(d)&rdquo; and its manifest injustice&rdquo; standard. Some courts, however, have indicated that the rule 32(d) standard provides a somewhat broader basis for relief than &sect;2255. <em>United States v. Dabdoub-Diaz</em>, 599 F.2d 96 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Watson</em>, 548 F.2d 1058 (D.C.Cir. 1977): <em>Meyer v. United States</em>, 424 F.2d 1181 (8th Cir.1970); <em>United States v. Kent</em>, 397 F.2d 446 (7th Cir. 1968). It is noteworthy, however, that in <em>Dabdoub-Diaz, Meyer</em> and <em>Kent</em> the defendant did not prevail under either &sect;2255 or Rule 32(d), and that in <em>Watson</em>, though the &sect;2255 case was remanded for consideration as a 32(d) motion, defendant's complaint (that he was not advised of the special parole term, though the sentence he received did not exceed that he was warned about by the court) was one as to which relief had been denied even upon direct appeal from the conviction. <em>United States v. Peters</em>, No. 77&ndash;1700 (4th Cir. Dec. 22, 1978).</p>
<p class="note-body">Indeed, it may more generally be said that the results in &sect;2255 and 32(d) guilty plea cases have been for the most part the same. Relief has often been granted or recognized as available via either of these routes for essentially the same reasons: that there exists a complete constitutional bar to conviction on the offense charged, <em>Brooks v. United States</em>, 424 F.2d 425 (5th Cir. 1970) (&sect;2255), <em>United States v. Bluso</em>, 519 F.2d 473 (4th Cir. 1975) (Rule 32); that the defendant was incompetent at the time of his plea, <em>United States v. Masthers</em>, 539 F.2d 721 (D.C.Cir. 1976) (&sect;2255), <em>Kienlen v. United States</em>, 379 F.2d 20 (10th Cir. 1967) (Rule 32); and that the bargain the prosecutor made with defendant was not kept, <em>Walters v. Harris</em>, 460 F.2d 988 (4th Cir. 1972) (&sect;2255), <em>United States v. Hawthorne</em>, 502 F.2d 1183 (3rd Cir. 1974) (Rule 32). Perhaps even more significant is the fact that relief has often been denied under like circumstances whichever of the two procedures was used: a mere technical violation of Rule 11, <em>United States v. Timmreck</em>, 441 U.S. 780 (1979) (&sect;2255), <em>United States v. Saft</em>, 558 F.2d 1073 (2d Cir. 1977) (Rule 32); the mere fact defendants expected a lower sentence, <em>United States v. White</em>, 572 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1978) (&sect;2255), <em>Masciola v. United States</em>, 469 F.2d 1057 (3rd Cir. 1972) (Rule 32); or mere familial coercion, <em>Wojtowicz v. United States</em>, 550 F.2d 786 (2d Cir. 1977) (&sect;2255), <em>United States v. Bartoli</em>, 572 F.2d 188 (8th Cir. 1978) (Rule 32).</p>
<p class="note-body">The one clear instance in which a Rule 32(d) attack might prevail when a &sect;2255 challenge would not is present in those circuits which have reached the questionable result that post-sentence relief under 32(d) is available not merely upon a showing of a &ldquo;manifest injustice&rdquo; but also for any deviation from literal compliance with Rule 11. <em>United States v. Cantor</em>, 469 F.2d 435 (3d Cir. 1972). See Advisory Committee Note to Rule 11(h), noting the unsoundness of that position.</p>
<p class="note-body">The change in Rule 32(d), therefore, is at best a minor one in terms of how post-sentence motions to withdraw pleas will be decided. It avoids the confusion which now obtains as to whether a &sect;2255 petition must be assumed to also be a 32(d) motion and, if so, whether this bears significantly upon how the matter should be decided. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Watson</em>, supra. It also avoids the present undesirable situation in which the mere selection of one of two highly similar avenues of relief, rule 32(d) or &sect;2255, may have significant procedural consequences, such as whether the government can take an appeal from the district court's adverse ruling (possible under &sect;2255 only). Moreover, because &sect;2255 and Rule 32(d) are properly characterized as the &ldquo;two principal procedures for collateral attack of a federal plea conviction,&rdquo; Borman, <em>The Hidden Right to Direct Appeal From a Federal Conviction</em>, 64 Cornell L.Rev. 319, 327 (1979), this amendment is also in keeping with the proposition underlying the Supreme Court's decision in <em>United States v. Timmreck</em>, supra, namely, that &ldquo;the concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas.&rdquo; The amendment is likewise consistent with ALI Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure &sect;350.9 (1975) (&ldquo;Allegations of noncompliance with the procedures provided in Article 350 shall not be a basis for review of a conviction after the appeal period for such conviction has expired, unless such review is required by the Constitution of the United States or of this State or otherwise by the law of this State other than Article 350&rdquo;); ABA Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice &sect;14&ndash;2.1 (2d ed. 1978) (using &ldquo;manifest injustice&rdquo; standard, but listing six specific illustrations each of which would be basis for relief under &sect;2255); Unif.R.Crim.P. 444(e) (Approved Draft, 1974) (using &ldquo;interest of justice&rdquo; test, but listing five specific illustrations each of which would be basis for relief under &sect;2255).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of the amended rule incorporates the &ldquo;fair and just&rdquo; standard which the federal courts, relying upon dictum in <em>Kercheval v. United States</em>, 274 U.S. 220 (1927), have consistently applied to presentence motions. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Strauss</em>, 563 F.2d 127 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Bradin</em>, 535 F.2d 1039 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Barker</em>, 514 F.2d 208 (D.C.Cir. 1975). Under the rule as amended, it is made clear that the defendant has the burden of showing a &ldquo;fair and just&rdquo; reason for withdrawal of the plea. This is consistent with the prevailing view, which is that &ldquo;the defendant has the burden of satisfying the trial judge that there are valid grounds for withdrawal,&rdquo; see <em>United States v. Michaelson</em>, supra, and cases cited therein. (Illustrative of a reason which would meet this test but would likely fall short of the &sect;2255 test is where the defendant now wants to pursue a certain defense which he for good reason did not put forward earlier, <em>United States v. Barker</em>, supra.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Although &ldquo;the terms &lsquo;fair and just&rsquo; lack any pretense of scientific exactness,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Barker</em>, supra, guidelines have emerged in the appellate cases for applying this standard. Whether the movant has asserted his legal innocence is an important factor to be weighed, <em>United States v. Joslin</em>, 434 F.2d 526 (D.C.Cir. 1970), as is the reason why the defenses were not put forward at the time of original pleading. <em>United States v. Needles</em>, 472 F.2d 652 (2d Cir. 1973). The amount of time which has passed between the plea and the motion must also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;A swift change of heart is itself strong indication that the plea was entered in haste and confusion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. By contrast, if the defendant has long delayed his withdrawal motion, and has had the full benefit of competent counsel at all times, the reasons given to support withdrawal must have considerably more force.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>United States v. Barker</em>, supra.</p>
<p class="note-body">If the defendant establishes such a reason, it is then appropriate to consider whether the government would be prejudiced by withdrawal of the plea. Substantial prejudice may be present for a variety of reasons. See <!-- PDFPage:117 --><em>United States v. Jerry</em>, 487 F.2d 600 (3d Cir. 1973) (physical evidence had been discarded); <em>United States v. Vasquez-Velasco</em>, 471 F.2d 294 (9th Cir. 1973) (death of chief government witness); <em>United States v. Lombardozzi</em>, 436 F.2d 878 (2d Cir. 1971) (other defendants with whom defendant had been joined for trial had already been tried in a lengthy trial); <em>Farnsworth v. Sanford</em>, 115 F.2d 375 (5th Cir. 1940) (prosecution had dismissed 52 witnesses who had come from all over the country and from overseas bases).</p>
<p class="note-body">There is currently some disparity in the manner in which presentence motions to withdraw a guilty plea are dealt with. Some courts proceed as if any desire to withdraw the plea before sentence is &ldquo;fair and just&rdquo; so long as the government fails to establish that it would be prejudiced by the withdrawal. Illustrative is <em>United States v. Savage</em>, 561 F.2d 554 (4th Cir. 1977), where the defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that the government would recommend a sentence of 5 years. At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge indicated his unwillingness to follow the government's recommendation, so the defendant moved to withdraw his plea. That motion was denied. On appeal, the court held that there had been no violation of Rule 11, in that refusal to accept the government's recommendation does not constitute a rejection of the plea agreement. But the court then proceeded to hold that absent any showing of prejudice by the government, &ldquo;the defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea&rdquo;; only upon such a showing by the government must the court &ldquo;weigh the defendant's reasons for seeking to withdraw his plea against the prejudice which the government will suffer.&rdquo; The other view is that there is no occasion to inquire into the matter of prejudice unless the defendant first shows a good reason for being allowed to withdraw his plea. As stated in <em>United States v. Saft</em>, 558 F.2d 1073 (2d Cir. 1977): &ldquo;The Government is not required to show prejudice when a defendant has shown no sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal of a guilty plea, although such prejudice may be considered by the district court in exercising its discretion.&rdquo; The second sentence of the amended rule, by requiring that the defendant show a &ldquo;fair and just&rdquo; reason, adopts the <em>Saft</em> position and rejects that taken in <em>Savage.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">The <em>Savage</em> position, as later articulated in <em>United States v. Strauss</em>, supra, is that the &ldquo;sounder view, supported by both the language of the rule and by the reasons for it, would be to allow withdrawal of the plea prior to sentencing unless the prosecution has been substantially prejudiced by reliance upon the defendant's plea.&rdquo; (Quoting 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure &sect;538, at 474&ndash;75 (1969). Although that position may once have been sound, this is no longer the case in light of the recent revisions of Rule 11. Rule 11 now provides for the placing of plea agreements on the record, for full inquiry into the voluntariness of the plea, for detailed advice to the defendant concerning his rights and the consequences of his plea and a determination that the defendant understands these matters, and for a determination of the accuracy of the plea. Given the great care with which pleas are taken under this revised Rule 11, there is no reason to view pleas so taken as merely &ldquo;tentative,&rdquo; subject to withdrawal before sentence whenever the government cannot establish prejudice.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Were withdrawal automatic in every case where the defendant decided to alter his tactics and present his theory of the case to the jury, the guilty plea would become a mere gesture, a temporary and meaningless formality reversible at the defendant's whim. In fact, however, a guilty plea is no such trifle, but &ldquo;a grave and solemn act,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;accepted only with care and discernment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>United States v. Barker</em>, supra, quoting from <em>Brady v. United States</em>, 397 U.S. 742 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">The facts of the <em>Savage</em> case reflect the wisdom of this position. In <em>Savage</em>, the defendant had entered into a plea agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the government's promise to recommend a sentence of 5 years, which the defendant knew was not binding on the court. Yet, under the approach taken in <em>Savage</em>, the defendant remains free to renege on his plea bargain, notwithstanding full compliance therewith by the attorney for the government, if it later appears to him from the presentence report or the comments of the trial judge or any other source that the court will not follow the government's recommendation. Having bargained for a recommendation pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(B), the defendant should not be entitled, in effect, to unilaterally convert the plea agreement into a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) type of agreement (i.e., one with a guarantee of a specific sentence which, if not given, permits withdrawal of the plea).</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of subdivision (d) provides that the motion, to be judged under the more liberal &ldquo;fair and just reason&rdquo; test, must have been made before sentence is imposed, imposition of sentence is suspended, or disposition is had under 18 U.S.C. &sect;4205(c). The latter of these has been added to the rule to make it clear that the lesser standard also governs prior to the second stage of sentencing when the judge, pursuant to that statute, has committed the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General for study pending final disposition. Several circuits have left this issue open, e.g., <em>United States v. McCoy</em>, 477 F.2d 550 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Callaway v. United States</em>, 367 F.2d 140 (10th Cir. 1966); while some have held that a withdrawal motion filed between tentative and final sentencing should be judged against the presentence standard, <em>United States v. Barker</em>, 514 F.2d 208 (D.C.Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Thomas</em>, 415 F.2d 1216 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>
<p class="note-body">Inclusion of the &sect;4205(c) situation under the presentence standard is appropriate. As explained in <em>Barker:</em></p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Two reasons of policy have been advanced to explain the near-presumption which Rule 32(d) erects against post-sentence withdrawal motions. The first is that post-sentence withdrawal subverts the &ldquo;stability&rdquo; of &ldquo;final judgments.&rdquo; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The second reason is that the post-sentence withdrawal motion often constitutes a veiled attack on the judge's sentencing decision; to grant such motions in lenient fashion might</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;undermine respect for the courts and fritter away the time and painstaking effort devoted to the sentence process.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Concern for the &ldquo;stability of final judgments&rdquo; has little application to withdrawal motions filed between tentative and final sentencing under Section 4208(b) [now 4205(c)]. The point at which a defendant's judgment of conviction becomes &ldquo;final&rdquo; for purposes of appeal&mdash;whether at tentative or at final sentencing&mdash;is wholly within the defendant's discretion. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Concern for the integrity of the sentencing process is, however, another matter. The major point, in our view, is that tentative sentencing under Section 4208(b) [now 4205(c)] leaves the defendant ignorant of his final sentence. He will therefore be unlikely to use a withdrawal motion as an oblique attack on the judge's sentencing policy. The relative leniency of the &ldquo;fair and just&rdquo; standard is consequently not out of place.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (a)(1) is intended to clarify that the court is expected to proceed without unnecessary delay, and that it may be necessary to delay sentencing when an applicable sentencing factor cannot be resolved at the time set for sentencing. Often, the factor will relate to a defendant's agreement to cooperate with the government. But, other factors may be capable of resolution if the court delays sentencing while additional information is generated. As <!-- PDFPage:118 -->currently written, the rule might imply that a delay requested by one party or suggested by the court <em>sua sponte</em> might be unreasonable. The amendment rids the rule of any such implication and provides the sentencing court with desirable discretion to assure that relevant factors are considered and accurately resolved. In exercising this discretion, the court retains under the amendment the authority to refuse to delay sentencing when a delay is inappropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">In amending subdivision (c)(1), the Committee conformed the rule to the current practice in some courts: i.e., to permit the defendant and the prosecutor to see a presentence report prior to a plea of guilty if the court, with the written consent of the defendant, receives the report at that time. The amendment permits, but does not require, disclosure of the report with the written consent of the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to change the &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; language in subdivision (c)(3)(A) to at least 10 days prior to sentencing, unless the defendant waives the minimum period, conforms the rule to 18 U.S.C. 3552(d). Nothing in the statue [sic] or the rule prohibits a court from requiring disclosure at an earlier time before sentencing. The inclusion of a specific waiver provision is intended to conform the rule to the statute and is not intended to suggest that waiver of other rights is precluded when no specific waiver provision is set forth in a rule or portion thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language requiring the court to provide the defendant and defense counsel with a copy of the presentence report complements the abrogation of subdivision (E), which had required the defense to return the probation report. Because a defendant or the government may seek to appeal a sentence, an option that is permitted under some circumstances, there will be cases in which the defendant has a need for the presentence report during the preparation of, or the response to, an appeal. This is one reason why the Committee decided that the defendant should not be required to return the nonconfidential portions of the presentence report that have been disclosed. Another reason is that district courts may find it desirable to adopt portions of the presentence report when making findings of fact under the guidelines. They would be inhibited unnecessarily from relying on careful, accurate presentence reports if such reports could not be retained by defendants. A third reason why defendant should be able to retain the reports disclosed to them is that the Supreme Court's decision in <em>United States Department of Justice v. Julian</em>, 486 U.S. 1 (1988), 108 S.Ct. 1606 (1988), suggests that defendants will routinely be able to secure their reports through Freedom of Information Act suits. No public interest is served by continuing to require the return of reports, and unnecessary FOIA litigation should be avoided as a result of the amendment to Rule 32.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule does not direct whether the defendant or the defendant's lawyer should retain the presentence report. In exceptional cases where retention of a report in a local detention facility might pose a danger to persons housed there, the district judge may direct that the defendant not personally retain a copy of the report until the defendant has been transferred to the facility where the sentence will be served.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the parties need not return the presentence report to the probation officer, the Solicitor General should be able to review the report in deciding whether to permit the United States to appeal a sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3551 et seq.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the Committee was concerned about the potential unfairness of having confidential or diagnostic material included in presentence reports but not disclosed to a defendant who might be adversely affected by such material, it decided not to recommend at this time a change in the rule which would require complete disclosure. Some diagnostic material might be particularly useful when a court imposes probation, and might well be harmful to the defendant if disclosed. Moreover, some of this material might assist correctional officials in prescribing treatment programs for an incarcerated defendant. Information provided by confidential sources and information posing a possible threat of harm to third parties was particularly troubling to the Committee, since this information is often extremely negative and thus potentially harmful to a defendant. The Committee concluded, however, that it was preferable to permit the probation officer to include this information in a report so that the sentencing court may determine whether is [it] ought to be disclosed to the defendant. If the court determines that it should not be disclosed, it will have to decide whether to summarize the contents of the information or to hold that no finding as to the undisclosed information will be made because such information will not be taken into account in sentencing. Substantial due process problems may arise if a court attempts to summarize information in a presentence report, the defendant challenges the information, and the court attempts to make a finding as to the accuracy of the information without disclosing to the defendant the source of the information or the details placed before the court. In deciding not to require disclosure of everything in a presentence report, the Committee made no judgment that findings could validly be made based upon nondisclosed information.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, portions of the rule were gender-neutralized.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive changes are intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The original subdivision (e) has been deleted due to statutory changes affecting the authority of a court to grant probation. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. 3561(a). Its replacement is one of a number of contemporaneous amendments extending Rule 26.2 to hearings and proceedings other than the trial itself. The amendment to Rule 32 specifically codifies the result in cases such as <em>United States v. Rosa</em>, 891 F.2d 1074 (3d. Cir. 1989). In that case the defendant pleaded guilty to a drug offense. During sentencing the defendant unsuccessfully attempted to obtain Jencks Act materials relating to a co-accused who testified as a government witness at sentencing. In concluding that the trial court erred in not ordering the government to produce its witness's statement, the court stated:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">We believe the sentence imposed on a defendant is the most critical stage of criminal proceedings, and is, in effect, the &ldquo;bottom-line&rdquo; for the defendant, particularly where the defendant has pled guilty. This being so, we can perceive no purpose in denying the defendant the ability to effectively cross-examine a government witness where such testimony may, if accepted, and substantially to the defendant's sentence. In such a setting, we believe that the rationale of <em>Jencks v. United States</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and the purpose of the Jencks Act would be disserved if the government at such a grave stage of a criminal proceeding could deprive the accused of material valuable not only to the defense but to his very liberty. <em>Id</em>. at 1079.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court added that the defendant had not been sentenced under the new Sentencing Guidelines and that its decision could take on greater importance under those rules. Under Guideline sentencing, said the court, the trial judge has less discretion to moderate a sentence and is required to impose a sentence based upon specific factual findings which need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id</em> at n. 3.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the <em>Rosa</em> decision decided only the issue of access by the defendant to Jencks material, the amendment parallels Rules 26.2 (applying Jencks Act to trial) and 12(i) (applying Jencks Act to suppression hearing) in that both the defense and the prosecution are entitled to Jencks material.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:119 --><p class="note-body">Production of a statement is triggered by the witness's oral testimony. The sanction provision rests on the assumption that the proponent of the witness's testimony has deliberately elected to withhold relevant material.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rule 32 are intended to accomplish two primary objectives. First, the amendments incorporate elements of a &ldquo;Model Local Rule for Guideline Sentencing&rdquo; which was proposed by the Judicial Conference Committee on Probation Administration in 1987. That model rule and the accompanying report were prepared to assist trial judges in implementing guideline sentencing mandated by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. <em>See</em> Committee on the Admin. of the Probation Sys., Judicial Conference of the U.S., Recommended Procedures for Guideline Sentencing and Commentary: Model Local Rule for Guideline Sentencing, Reprinted in T. Hutchinson & D. Yellen, <em>Federal Sentencing Law and Practice</em>, app. 8, at 431 (1989). It was anticipated that sentencing hearings would become more complex due to the new fact finding requirements imposed by guideline sentencing methodology. <em>See</em> U.S.S.G. &sect;6A1.2. Accordingly, the model rule focused on preparation of the presentence report as a means of identifying and narrowing the issues to be decided at the sentencing hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, in the process of effecting those amendments, the rule was reorganized. Over time, numerous amendments to the rule had created a sort of hodge podge; the reorganization represents an attempt to reflect an appropriate sequential order in the sentencing procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Subdivision (a) retains the general mandate that sentence be imposed without unnecessary delay thereby permitting the court to regulate the time to be allowed for the probation officer to complete the presentence investigation and submit the report. The only requirement is that sufficient time be allowed for completion of the process prescribed by subdivision (b)(6) unless the time periods established in the subdivision are shortened or lengthened by the court for good cause. Such limits are not intended to create any new substantive right for the defendant or the Government which would entitle either to relief if a time limit prescribed in the rule is not kept.</p>
<p class="note-body">The remainder of subdivision (a), which addressed the sentencing hearing, is now located in subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Subdivision (b) (formerly subdivision (c)), which addresses the presentence investigation, has been modified in several respects.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, subdivision (b)(2) is a new provision which provides that, on request, defense counsel is entitled to notice and a reasonable opportunity to be present at any interview of the defendant conducted by the probation officer. Although the courts have not held that presentence interviews are a critical stage of the trial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the amendment reflects case law which has indicated that requests for counsel to be present should be honored. <em>See</em>, e.g., <em>United States v. Herrera-Figueroa</em>, 918 F.2d 1430, 1437 (9th Cir. 1990) (court relied on its supervisory power to hold that probation officers must honor request for counsel's presence); <em>United States v. Tisdale</em>, 952 F.2d 934, 940 (6th Cir. 1992) (court agreed with rule requiring probation officers to honor defendant's request for attorney or request from attorney not to interview defendant in absence of counsel). The Committee believes that permitting counsel to be present during such interviews may avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between the probation officer and the defendant. The rule does not further define the term &ldquo;interview.&rdquo; The Committee intended for the provision to apply to any communication initiated by the probation officer where he or she is asking the defendant to provide information which will be used in preparation of the presentence investigation. Spontaneous or unplanned encounters between the defendant and the probation officer would normally not fall within the purview of the rule. The Committee also believed that the burden should rest on defense counsel, having received notice, to respond as promptly as possible to enable timely completion of the presentence report.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(6), formerly (c)(3), includes several changes which recognize the key role the presentence report is playing under guideline sentencing. The major thrust of these changes is to address the problem of resolving objections by the parties to the probation officer's presentence report. Subdivision (b)(6)(A) now provides that the probation officer must present the presentence report to the parties not later than 35 days before the sentencing hearing (rather than 10 days before imposition of the sentence) in order to provide some additional time to the parties and the probation officer to attempt to resolve objections to the report. There has been a slight change in the practice of deleting from the copy of the report given to the parties certain information specified in (b)(6)(A). Under that new provision (changing former subdivision (c)(3)(A)), the court has the discretion (in an individual case or in accordance with a local rule) to direct the probation officer to withhold any final recommendation concerning the sentence. Otherwise, the recommendation, if any, is subject to disclosure. The prior practice of not disclosing confidential information, or other information which might result in harm to the defendant or other persons, is retained in (b)(5).</p>
<p class="note-body">New subdivisions (b)(6)(B), (C), and (D) now provide explicit deadlines and guidance on resolving disputes about the contents of the presentence report. The amendments are intended to provide early resolution of such disputes by (1) requiring the parties to provide the probation officer with a written list of objections to the report within 14 days of receiving the report; (2) permitting the probation officer to meet with the defendant, the defendant's counsel, and the attorney for the Government to discuss objections to the report, conduct an additional investigation, and to make revisions to the report as deemed appropriate; (3) requiring the probation officer to submit the report to the court and the parties not later than 7 days before the sentencing hearing, noting any unresolved disputes; and (4) permitting the court to treat the report as its findings of fact, except for the parties&rsquo; unresolved objections. Although the rule does not explicitly address the question of whether counsel's objections to the report are to be filed with the court, there is nothing in the rule which would prohibit a court from requiring the parties to file their original objections or have them included as an addendum to the presentence report.</p>
<p class="note-body">This procedure, which generally mirrors the approach in the Model Local Rule for Guideline Sentencing, supra, is intended to maximize judicial economy by providing for more orderly sentencing hearings while also providing fair opportunity for both parties to review, object to, and comment upon, the probation officer's report in advance of the sentencing hearing. Under the amendment, the parties would still be free at the sentencing hearing to comment on the presentence report, and in the discretion of the court, to introduce evidence concerning their objections to the report.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Subdivision (c) addresses the imposition of sentence and makes no major changes in current practice. The provision consists largely of material formerly located in subdivision (a). Language formerly in (a)(1) referring to the court's disclosure to the parties of the probation officer's determination of the sentencing classifications and sentencing guideline range is now located in subdivisions (b)(4)(B) and (c)(1). Likewise, the brief reference in former (a)(1) to the ability of the parties to comment on the probation officer's determination of sentencing classifications and sentencing guideline range is now located in (c)(1) and (c)(3).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(1) is not intended to require that resolution of objections and imposition of the sentence occur at the same time or during the same hearing. It requires only that the court rule on any objections be<!-- PDFPage:120 -->fore sentence is imposed. In considering objections during the sentencing hearing, the court may in its discretion, permit the parties to introduce evidence. The rule speaks in terms of the court's discretion, but the Sentencing Guidelines specifically provide that the court must provide the parties with a reasonable opportunity to offer information concerning a sentencing factor reasonably in dispute. <em>See</em> U.S.S.G. &sect;6A1.3(a). Thus, it may be an abuse of discretion not to permit the introduction of additional evidence. Although the rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing proceedings, <em>see</em> Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(3), the court clearly has discretion in determining the mode, timing, and extent of the evidence offered. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez</em>, 922 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 1990) (trial court did not err in denying defendant's late request to introduce rebuttal evidence by way of cross-examination).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(1) (formerly subdivision (c)(3)(D)) indicates that the court need not resolve controverted matters which will &ldquo;not be taken into account in, or will not affect, sentencing.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;will not affect&rdquo; did not exist in the former provision but were added in the revision in recognition that there might be situations, due to overlaps in the sentencing ranges, where a controverted matter would not alter the sentence even if the sentencing range were changed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision for disclosure of a witness&rsquo; statements, which was recently proposed as an amendment to Rule 32 as new subdivision (e), is now located in subdivision (c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(3) includes minor changes. First, if the court intends to rely on information otherwise excluded from the presentence report under subdivision (b)(5), that information is to be summarized in writing and submitted to the defendant and the defendant's counsel. Under the former provision in (c)(3)(A), such information could be summarized orally. Once the information is presented, the defendant and the defendant's counsel are to be given a reasonable opportunity to comment; in appropriate cases, that may require a continuance of the sentencing proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(5), concerning notification of the right to appeal, was formerly included in subdivision (a)(2). Although the provision has been rewritten, the Committee intends no substantive change in practice. That is, the court may, but is not required to, advise a defendant who has entered a guilty plea, nolo contendere plea or a conditional guilty plea of any right to appeal (such as an appeal challenging jurisdiction). However, the duty to advise the defendant in such cases extends only to advice on the right to appeal any sentence imposed.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Subdivision (d), dealing with entry of the court's judgment, is former subdivision (b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Subdivision (e), which addresses the topic of withdrawing pleas, was formerly subdivision (d). Both provisions remain the same except for minor stylistic changes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under present practice, the court may permit, but is not required to hear, victim allocution before imposing sentence. The Committee considered, but rejected, a provision which would have required the court to hear victim allocution at sentencing.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1996 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(2)</em>. A provision for including a verdict of criminal forfeiture as a part of the sentence was added in 1972 to Rule 32. Since then, the rule has been interpreted to mean that any forfeiture order is a part of the judgment of conviction and cannot be entered before sentencing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Alexander</em>, 772 F.Supp. 440 (D. Minn. 1990).</p>
<p class="note-body">Delaying forfeiture proceedings, however, can pose real problems, especially in light of the implementation of the Sentencing Reform Act in 1987 and the resulting delays between verdict and sentencing in complex cases. First, the government's statutory right to discover the location of property subject to forfeiture is triggered by entry of an order of forfeiture. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;1963(k) and 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(m). If that order is delayed until sentencing, valuable time may be lost in locating assets which may have become unavailable or unusable. Second, third persons with an interest in the property subject to forfeiture must also wait to petition the court to begin ancillary proceedings until the forfeiture order has been entered. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;1963(<em>l</em>) and 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(m). And third, because the government cannot actually seize the property until an order of forfeiture is entered, it may be necessary for the court to enter restraining orders to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 32 is intended to address these concerns by specifically recognizing the authority of the court to enter a preliminary forfeiture order before sentencing. Entry of an order of forfeiture before sentencing rests within the discretion of the court, which may take into account anticipated delays in sentencing, the nature of the property, and the interests of the defendant, the government, and third persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment permits the court to enter its order of forfeiture at any time before sentencing. Before entering the order of forfeiture, however, the court must provide notice to the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the question of timing and form of any order of forfeiture.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule specifies that the order, which must ultimately be made a part of the sentence and included in the judgment, must contain authorization for the Attorney General to seize the property in question and to conduct appropriate discovery and to begin any necessary ancillary proceedings to protect third parties who have an interest in the property.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Modification of Proposed 1994 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 230101(a) of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322 [set out as a note under section 2074 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure] provided that the amendment proposed by the Supreme Court [in its order of Apr. 29, 1994] affecting rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [this rule] would take effect on Dec. 1, 1994, as otherwise provided by law, and as amended by section 230101(b) of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322. See 1994 Amendment note below.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to reflect the creation of new Rule 32.2, which now governs criminal forfeiture procedures.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 32 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule has been completely reorganized to make it easier to follow and apply. For example, the definitions in the rule have been moved to the first section and the sequencing of the sections generally follows the procedure for presentencing and sentencing procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32(a) contains definitions that currently appear in Rule 32(f). One substantive change was made in Rule 32(a)(2). The Committee expanded the definition of victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse to include victims of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2251&ndash;2257 (child pornography and related offenses). The Committee considered those victims to be similar to victims of sexual offenses under 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2241&ndash;2248, who already possess that right.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32(d) has been amended to more clearly set out the contents of the presentence report concerning the application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>
<p class="note-body">Current Rule 32(e), which addresses the ability of a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea, has been moved to Rule 11(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 32(h) is a new provision that reflects <em>Burns v. United States</em>, 501 U.S. 129, 138&ndash;39 (1991). In <em>Burns</em>, the <!-- PDFPage:121 -->Court held that, before a sentencing court could depart upward on a ground not previously identified in the presentence report as a ground for departure, Rule 32 requires the court to give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling and to identify the specific ground for the departure. The Court also indicated that because the procedural entitlements in Rule 32 apply equally to both parties, it was equally appropriate to frame the issue as whether notice is required before the sentencing court departs either upward or downward. <em>Id</em>. at 135, n.4.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32(i)(3) addresses changes to current Rule 32(c)(1). Under the current rule, the court is required to &ldquo;rule on any unresolved objections to the presentence report.&rdquo; The rule does not specify, however, whether that provision should be read literally to mean every objection that might have been made to the report or only on those objections that might in some way actually affect the sentence. The Committee believed that a broad reading of the current rule might place an unreasonable burden on the court without providing any real benefit to the sentencing process. Revised Rule 32(i)(3) narrows the requirement for court findings to those instances when the objection addresses a &ldquo;controverted matter.&rdquo; If the objection satisfies that criterion, the court must either make a finding on the objection or decide that a finding is not required because the matter will not affect sentencing or that the matter will not be considered at all in sentencing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32(i)(4)(B) provides for the right of certain victims to address the court during sentencing. As noted, <em>supra</em>, revised Rule 32(a)(2) expands the definition of victims to include victims of crimes under 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2251&ndash;57 (child pornography and related offenses). Thus, they too will now be permitted to address the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32(i)(1)(B) is intended to clarify language that currently exists in Rule 32(h)(3), that the court must inform both parties that the court will rely on information not in the presentence report and provide them with an opportunity to comment on the information.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 32(i)(4)(C) includes a change concerning who may request an in camera proceeding. Under current Rule 32(c)(4), the parties must file a joint motion for an in camera proceeding to hear the statements by defense counsel, the defendant, the attorney for the government, or any victim. Under the revised rule, any party may move (for good cause) that the court hear in camera any statement&mdash;by a party or a victim&mdash;made under revised Rule 32(i)(4).</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the Committee considered, but did not adopt, an amendment that would have required the court to rule on any &ldquo;unresolved objection to a material matter&rdquo; in the presentence report, whether or not the court will consider it in imposing an appropriate sentence. The amendment was considered because an unresolved objection that has no impact on determining a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines may affect other important post-sentencing decisions. For example, the Bureau of Prisons consults the presentence report in deciding where a defendant will actually serve his or her sentence of confinement. <em>See A Judicial Guide to the Federal Bureau of Prisons</em>, 11 (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons 1995) (noting that the &ldquo;Bureau relies primarily on the Presentence Investigator Report .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;). And as some courts have recognized, Rule 32 was intended to guard against adverse consequences of a statement in the presentence report that the court may have been found to be false. <em>United States v. Velasquez</em>, 748 F.2d 972, 974 (8th Cir. 1984) (rule designed to protect against evil that false allegation that defendant was notorious alien smuggler would affect defendant for years to come); <em>see also United States v. Brown</em>, 715 F.2d 387, 389 n.2 (5th Cir. 1983) (sentencing report affects &ldquo;place of incarceration, chances for parole, and relationships with social service and correctional agencies after release from prison&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">To avoid unduly burdening the court, the Committee elected not to require resolution of objections that go only to service of sentence. However, because of the presentence report's critical role in post-sentence administration, counsel may wish to point out to the court those matters that are typically considered by the Bureau of Prisons in designating the place of confinement. For example, the Bureau considers:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">the type of offense, the length of sentence, the defendant's age, the defendant's release residence, the need for medical or other special treatment, and any placement recommendation made by the court.</p>
<p class="note-body-block"><em>A Judicial Guide to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, supra</em>, at 11. Further, a question as to whether or not the defendant has a &ldquo;drug problem&rdquo; could have an impact on whether the defendant would be eligible for prison drug abuse treatment programs. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3621(e) (Substance abuse treatment).</p>
<p class="note-body">If counsel objects to material in the presentence report that could affect the defendant's service of sentence, the court may resolve the objection, but is not required to do so.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. The amendment conforms Rule 32(d) to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>United States v. Booker</em>, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). <em>Booker</em> held that the provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3553(b)(1), violates the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. With this provision severed and excised, the Court held, the Sentencing Reform Act &ldquo;makes the Guidelines effectively advisory,&rdquo; and &ldquo;requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C.A. &sect;3553(a)(4) (Supp. 2004), but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see &sect;3553(a) (Supp. 2004).&rdquo; <em>Id</em>. at 245&ndash;46. Amended subdivision (d)(2)(F) makes clear that the court can instruct the probation office to gather and include in the presentence report any information relevant to the factors articulated in &sect;3553(a). The rule contemplates that a request can be made either by the court as a whole requiring information affecting all cases or a class of cases, or by an individual judge in a particular case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment</em>. The Committee revised the text of subdivision (d) in response to public comments. In subdivision (d), the Committee revised the title to include the word &ldquo;Advisory&rdquo; in order better to reflect the guidelines&rsquo; role under the <em>Booker</em> decision. It withdrew proposed subdivisions (k) and (h).</p>
<p class="note-body">Proposed subdivision (h) would have expanded the sentencing court's obligation to give notice to the parties when it intends to rely on grounds not identified in either the presentence report or the parties&rsquo; submissions. The amendment was intended to respond to the courts&rsquo; expanded discretion under <em>Booker</em>. In light of a number of recent decisions in the lower courts considering the proper scope of this obligation in light of <em>Booker</em>, the proposed amendment was withdrawn for further study.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (k), which would have required that courts use a specified judgment and statement of reasons form, was withdrawn because of the passage of &sect;735 of the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act. This legislation amended 28 U.S.C. &sect;994(w) to impose a statutory requirement that sentencing information for each case be provided on &ldquo;the written statement of reasons form issued by the Judicial Conference and approved by the United States Sentencing Commission.&rdquo; The Criminal Law Committee, which had previously requested that the uniform collection of sentencing information be addressed by an amendment to the rules, withdrew that request in light of the enactment of the statutory requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, here&mdash;as in the other <em>Booker</em> rules&mdash;the Committee deleted the reference in the Committee Note to the Fifth Amendment from the description of the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Booker</em>.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The Crime Victims&rsquo; Rights Act, codified as 18 U.S.C. &sect;3771(e), adopted a new definition of <!-- PDFPage:122 -->the term &ldquo;crime victim.&rdquo; The new statutory definition has been incorporated in an amendment to Rule 1, which supersedes the provisions that have been deleted here.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)(1)</em>. This amendment implements the victim's statutory right under the Crime Victims&rsquo; Rights Act to &ldquo;full and timely restitution as provided in law.&rdquo; <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3771(a)(6). Whenever the law permits restitution, the presentence investigation report should contain information permitting the court to determine whether restitution is appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(2)(B)</em>. This amendment implements the Crime Victims&rsquo; Rights Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. &sect;3771. The amendment makes it clear that victim impact information should be treated in the same way as other information contained in the presentence report. It deletes language requiring victim impact information to be &ldquo;verified&rdquo; and &ldquo;stated in a nonargumentative style&rdquo; because that language does not appear in the other subparagraphs of Rule 32(d)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (i)(4)</em>. The deleted language, referring only to victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse, has been superseded by the Crime Victims&rsquo; Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3771(e). The act defines the term &ldquo;crime victim&rdquo; without limiting it to certain crimes, and provides that crime victims, so defined, have a right to be reasonably heard at all public court proceedings regarding sentencing. A companion amendment to Rule 1(b) adopts the statutory definition as the definition of the term &ldquo;victim&rdquo; for purposes of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and explains who may raise the rights of a victim, so the language in this subdivision is no longer needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (i)(4) has also been amended to incorporate the statutory language of the Crime Victims&rsquo; Rights Act, which provides that victims have the right &ldquo;to be reasonably heard&rdquo; in judicial proceedings regarding sentencing. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3771(a)(4). The amended rule provides that the judge must speak to any victim present in the courtroom at sentencing. Absent unusual circumstances, any victim who is present should be allowed a reasonable opportunity to speak directly to the judge.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment</em>. No changes were made in the text of the rule. In response to public comments, the Committee Note was amended to make it clear that absent unusual circumstances any victim who is in the courtroom should have a reasonable opportunity to speak directly to the judge.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)(2)(G)</em>. Rule 32.2(a) requires that the indictment or information provide notice to the defendant of the government's intent to seek forfeiture as part of the sentence. The amendment provides that the same notice be provided as part of the presentence report to the court. This will ensure timely consideration of the issues concerning forfeiture as part of the sentencing process.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment</em>. No changes were made to the proposed amendment to Rule 32.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body">1996&mdash;Subd. (b)(1). Pub.

<p class="note-body">Subd. (a)(2). Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;215(a)(2), inserted &ldquo;,&nbsp;including any right to appeal the sentence,&rdquo; after &ldquo;right to appeal&rdquo; in first sentence.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subd. (c)(2). Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;215(a)(5), amended subd. (c)(2) generally. Prior to amendment, subd. (c)(2) read as follows:</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(1). Since <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli</em>, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), it is clear that a probationer can no longer be denied due process in reliance on the dictum in <em>Escoe v. Zerbst</em>, 295 U.S. 490, 492 (1935), that probation is an &ldquo;act of grace.&rdquo; See Van Alstyne, The Demise of the Right-Privilege Distinction in Constitutional Law, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 1439 (1968); President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. Task Force Report: Corrections 86 (1967).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1) requires, consistent with the holding in <em>Scarpelli</em>, that a prompt preliminary hearing must be held whenever &ldquo;a probationer is held in custody on the ground that he has violated a condition of his probation.&rdquo; See 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653 regarding arrest of the probationer with or without a warrant. If there is to be a revocation hearing but there has not been a holding in custody for a probation violation, there need not be a preliminary hearing. It was the fact of such a holding in custody &ldquo;which prompted the Court to determine that a preliminary as well as a final revocation hearing was required to afford the petitioner due process of law.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Tucker</em>, 524 F.2d 77 (5th Cir. 1975). Consequently, a preliminary hearing need not be held if the probationer was at large and was not arrested but was allowed to appear voluntarily, <em>United States v. Strada</em>, 503 F.2d 1081 (8th Cir. 1974), or in response to a show cause order which &ldquo;merely requires his appearance in court,&rdquo; <em>United States v. Langford</em>, 369 F.Supp. 1107 (N.D.Ill. 1973); if the probationer was in custody pursuant to a new charge, <em>Thomas v. United States</em>, 391 F.Supp. 202 (W.D.Pa. 1975), or pursuant to a final conviction of a subsequent offense, <em>United States v. Tucker</em>, supra; or if he was arrested but obtained his release.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(A), (B) and (C) list the requirements for the preliminary hearing, as developed in <em>Morrissey</em> and made applicable to probation revocation cases in <em>Scarpelli</em>. Under (A), the probationer is to be given notice of the hearing and its purpose and of the alleged violation of probation. &ldquo;Although the allegations in a motion to revoke probation need not be as specific as an indictment, they must be sufficient to apprise the probationer of the conditions of his probation which he is alleged to have violated, as well as the dates and events which support the charge.&rdquo; <em>Kartman v. Parratt</em>, 397 F.Supp. 531 (D.Nebr. 1975). Under (B), the probationer is permitted to appear and present evidence in his own behalf. And under (C), <em>upon request</em> by the probationer, adverse witnesses shall be made available for questioning unless the magistrate determines that the informant would be subjected to risk or harm if his identity were disclosed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a)(1)(D) provides for notice to the probationer of his right to be represented by counsel at the preliminary hearing. Although <em>Scarpelli</em> did not impose as a constitutional requirement a right to counsel in all instances, under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(b) a defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel whenever charged &ldquo;with a violation of probation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The federal magistrate (see definition in rule 54(c)) is to keep a record of what transpires at the hearing and, if he finds probable cause of a violation, hold the probationer for a revocation hearing. The probationer may be released pursuant to rule 46(c) pending the revocation hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a)(2). Subdivision (a)(2) mandates a final revocation hearing within a reasonable time to determine whether the probationer has, in fact, violated the conditions of his probation and whether his probation should be revoked. Ordinarily this time will be measured from the time of the probable cause finding (if a preliminary hearing was held) or of the issuance of an order to show cause. However, what constitutes a reasonable time must be determined on the facts of the particular case, such as whether the probationer is available or could readily be made available. If the probationer has been convicted of and is incarcer<!-- PDFPage:125 -->ated for a new crime, and that conviction is the basis of the pending revocation proceedings, it would be relevant whether the probationer waived appearance at the revocation hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">The hearing required by rule 32.1(a)(2) is not a formal trial; the usual rules of evidence need not be applied. See <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, supra (&ldquo;the process should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial&rdquo;); Rule 1101(d)(e) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (rules not applicable to proceedings &ldquo;granting or revoking probation&rdquo;). Evidence that would establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required to support an order revoking probation. <em>United States v. Francischine</em>, 512 F.2d 827 (5th Cir. 1975). This hearing may be waived by the probationer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivisions (a)(2)(A)&ndash;(E) list the rights to which a probationer is entitled at the final revocation hearing. The final hearing is less a summary one because the decision under consideration is the ultimate decision to revoke rather than a mere determination of probable cause. Thus, the probationer has certain rights not granted at the preliminary hearing: (i) the notice under (A) must by written; (ii) under (B) disclosure of all the evidence against the probationer is required; and (iii) under (D) the probationer does not have to specifically request the right to confront adverse witnesses, and the court may not limit the opportunity to question the witnesses against him.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (a)(2)(E) the probationer must be given notice of his right to be represented by counsel. Although <em>Scarpelli</em> holds that the Constitution does not compel counsel in all probation revocation hearings, under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3006A(b) a defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel whenever charged &ldquo;with a violation of probation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Revocation of probation is proper if the court finds a violation of the conditions of probation and that such violation warrants revocation. Revocation followed by imprisonment is an appropriate disposition if the court finds on the basis of the original offense and the intervening conduct of the probationer that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) confinement is necessary to protect the public from further criminal activity by the offender; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) the offender is in need of correctional treatment which can most effectively be provided if he is confined; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) it would unduly depreciate the seriousness of the violation if probation were not revoked.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Probation &sect;5.1 (Approved Draft, 1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">If probation is revoked, the probationer may be required to serve the sentence originally imposed, or any lesser sentence, and if imposition of sentence was suspended he may receive any sentence which might have been imposed. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653. When a split sentence is imposed under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3651 and probation is subsequently revoked, the probationer is entitled to credit for the time served in jail but not for the time he was on probation. <em>Thomas v. United States</em>, 327 F.2d 795 (10th Cir.), cert, denied 377 U.S. 1000 (1964); <em>Schley v. Peyton</em>, 280 F.Supp. 307 (W.D.Va. 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). Subdivision (b) concerns proceedings on modification of probation (as provided for in 18 U.S.C. &sect;3651). The probationer should have the right to apply to the sentencing court for a clarification or change of conditions. American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Probation &sect;3.1(c) (Approved Draft, 1970). This avenue is important for two reasons: (1) the probationer should be able to obtain resolution of a dispute over an ambiguous term or the meaning of a condition without first having to violate it; and (2) in cases of neglect, overwork, or simply unreasonableness on the part of the probation officer, the probationer should have recourse to the sentencing court when a condition needs clarification or modification.</p>
<p class="note-body">Probation conditions should be subject to modification, for the sentencing court must be able to respond to changes in the probationer's circumstances as well as new ideas and methods of rehabilitation. See generally ABA Standards, supra, &sect;3.3. The Sentencing court is given the authority to shorten the term or end probation early upon its own motion without a hearing. And while the modification of probation is a part of the sentencing procedure, so that the probationer is ordinarily entitled to a hearing and presence of counsel, a modification favorable to the probationer may be accomplished without a hearing in the presence of defendant and counsel. <em>United States v. Bailey</em>, 343 F.Supp. 76 (W.D.Mo. 1971).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1989 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments recognize that convicted defendants may be on supervised release as well as on probation. See 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3583, and 3624(e).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The addition of subdivision (c) is one of several amendments that extend Rule 26.2 to Rules 32(f), 32.1, 46, and Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255. As noted in the Committee Note to Rule 26.2, the primary reason for extending that Rule to other hearings and proceedings rests heavily upon the compelling need for accurate information affecting the witnesses&rsquo; credibility. While that need is certainly clear in a trial on the merits, it is equally compelling, if not more so, in other pretrial and post-trial proceedings in which both the prosecution and defense have high interests at stake. In the case of revocation or modification of probation or supervised release proceedings, not only is the defendant's liberty interest at stake, the government has a stake in protecting the interests of the community.</p>
<p class="note-body">Requiring production of witness statements at hearings conducted under Rule 32.1 will enhance the procedural due process which the rule now provides and which the Supreme Court required in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, 408 U.S. 471 (1972) and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli</em>, 411 U.S. 778 (1973). Access to prior statements of a witness will enhance the ability of both the defense and prosecution to test the credibility of the other side's witnesses under Rule 32.1(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) and thus will assist the court in assessing credibility.</p>
<p class="note-body">A witness's statement must be produced only if the witness testifies.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 32.1 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 32.1 has been completely revised and expanded. The Committee believed that it was important to spell out more completely in this rule the various procedural steps that must be met when dealing with a revocation or modification of probation or supervised release. To that end, some language formerly located in Rule 40 has been moved to revised Rule 32.1. Throughout the rule, the terms &ldquo;magistrate judge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;court&rdquo; (<em>see</em> revised Rule 1(b) (Definitions)) are used to reflect that in revocation cases, initial proceedings in both felony and misdemeanor cases will normally be conducted before a magistrate judge, although a district judge may also conduct them. But a district judge must make the <!-- PDFPage:126 -->revocation decision if the offense of conviction was a felony. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(i) (recognizing that district judge may designate a magistrate judge to conduct a hearing and submit proposed findings of fact and recommendations).</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32.1(a)(1)&ndash;(4) is new material. Presently, there is no provision in the rules for conducting initial appearances for defendants charged with violating probation or supervised release&mdash;although some districts apply such procedures. Although the rule labels these proceedings as initial appearances, the Committee believed that it was best to separate those proceedings from Rule 5 proceedings, because the procedures differ for persons who are charged with violating conditions of probation or supervised release.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee is also aware that, in some districts, it is not the practice to have an initial appearance for a revocation of probation or supervised release proceeding. Although Rule 32.1(a) will require such an appearance, nothing in the rule prohibits a court from combining the initial appearance proceeding, if convened consistent with the &ldquo;without unnecessary delay&rdquo; time requirement of the rule, with the preliminary hearing under Rule 32.1(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32.1(a)(5) is derived from current Rule 40(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 32.1(a)(6), which is derived from current Rule 46(c), provides that the defendant bears the burden of showing that he or she will not flee or pose a danger pending a hearing on the revocation of probation or supervised release. The Committee believes that the new language is not a substantive change because it makes no change in practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 32.1(b)(1)(B)(iii) and Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) address the ability of a releasee to question adverse witnesses at the preliminary and revocation hearings. Those provisions recognize that the court should apply a balancing test at the hearing itself when considering the releasee's asserted right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The court is to balance the person's interest in the constitutionally guaranteed right to confrontation against the government's good cause for denying it. <em>See, e.g., Morrissey v. Brewer</em>, 408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972); <em>United States v. Comito</em>, 177 F.3d 1166 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Walker</em>, 117 F.3d 417 (9th Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Zentgraf</em>, 20 F.3d 906 (8th Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 32.1(c)(2)(A) permits the person to waive a hearing to modify the conditions of probation or supervised release. Although that language is new to the rule, the Committee believes that it reflects current practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">The remainder of revised Rule 32.1 is derived from the current Rule 32.1.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to Rule 32.1(b) and (c) are intended to address a gap in the rule. As noted by the court in <em>United States v. Frazier</em>, 283 F.3d 1242 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam), there is no explicit provision in current Rule 32.1 for allocution rights for a person upon revocation of supervised release. In that case the court noted that several circuits had concluded that the right to allocution in Rule 32 extended to supervised release revocation hearings. <em>See United States v. Patterson</em>, 128 F.3d 1259, 1261 (8th Cir. 1997) (Rule 32 right to allocution applies); <em>United States v. Rodriguez</em>, 23 F.3d 919, 921 (5th Cir. 1997) (right of allocution, in Rule 32, applies at revocation proceeding). But the court agreed with the Sixth Circuit that the allocution right in Rule 32 was not incorporated into Rule 32.1. <em>See United States v. Waters</em>, 158 F.3d 933 (6th Cir. 1998) (allocution right in Rule 32 does not apply to revocation proceedings). The <em>Frazier</em> court observed that the problem with the incorporation approach is that it would require application of other provisions specifically applicable to sentencing proceedings under Rule 32, but not expressly addressed in Rule 32.1. 283 F.3d at 1245. The court, however, believed that it would be &ldquo;better practice&rdquo; for courts to provide for allocution at revocation proceedings and stated that &ldquo;[t]he right of allocution seems both important and firmly embedded in our jurisprudence.&rdquo; <em>Id</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amended rule recognizes the importance of allocution and now explicitly recognizes that right at Rule 32.1(b)(2) revocation hearings, and extends it as well to Rule 32.1(c)(1) modification hearings where the court may decide to modify the terms or conditions of the defendant's probation. In each instance the court is required to give the defendant the opportunity to make a statement and present any mitigating information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment</em>. The Committee made no changes to Rule 32.1 following publication.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2006 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)(5)(B)(i).</em> Rule 32.1(a)(5)(B)(i) has been amended to permit the magistrate judge to accept a judgment, warrant, and warrant application by reliable electronic means. Currently, the rule requires the government to produce certified copies of those documents. This amendment parallels similar changes to Rules 5 and 41.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment reflects a number of significant improvements in technology. First, receiving documents by facsimile has become very commonplace and many courts are now equipped to receive filings by electronic means, and indeed, some courts encourage or require that certain documents be filed by electronic means. Second, the technology has advanced to the state where such filings could be sent from, and received at, locations outside the courthouse. Third, electronic media can now provide improved quality of transmission and security measures. In short, in a particular case, using electronic media to transmit a document might be just as reliable and efficient as using a facsimile.</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; is used to provide some flexibility to the rule and make allowance for further technological advances in transmitting data. The Committee envisions that the term &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; would include use of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule requires that if electronic means are to be used to transmit a warrant to the magistrate judge, the means used be &ldquo;reliable.&rdquo; While the rule does not further define that term, the Committee envisions that a court or magistrate judge would make that determination as a local matter. In deciding whether a particular electronic means, or media, would be reliable, the court might consider first, the expected quality and clarity of the transmission. For example, is it possible to read the contents of the warrant in its entirety, as though it were the original or a clean photocopy? Second, the court may wish to consider whether security measures are available to insure that the transmission is not compromised. In this regard, most courts are now equipped to require that certain documents contain a digital signature, or some other similar system for restricting access. Third, the court may consider whether there are reliable means of preserving the document for later use.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication and Comment.</em> The Committee made minor clarifying changes in the published rule at the suggestion of the Style Committee.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Evidence and Hearing.</em> The court's determination may be based on evidence already in the record, including any written plea agreement, and on any additional evidence or information submitted by the parties and accepted by the court as relevant and reliable. If the forfeiture is contested, on either party's request the court must conduct a hearing after the verdict or finding of guilty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Preliminary Order.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Contents of a Specific Order.</em> If the court finds that property is subject to forfeiture, it must promptly enter a preliminary order of forfeiture setting forth the amount of any money judgment, directing the forfeiture of specific property, and directing the forfeiture of any substitute property if the government has met the statutory criteria. The court must enter the order without regard to any third party's interest in the property. Determining whether a third party has such an interest must be deferred until any third party files a claim in an ancillary proceeding under Rule 32.2(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Timing.</em> Unless doing so is impractical, the court must enter the preliminary order sufficiently in advance of sentencing to allow the parties to suggest revisions or modifications before the order becomes final as to the defendant under Rule 32.2(b)(4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>General Order.</em> If, before sentencing, the court cannot identify all the specific property subject to forfeiture or calculate the total amount of the money judgment, the court may enter a forfeiture order that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) lists any identified property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) describes other property in general terms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) states that the order will be amended under Rule 32.2(e)(1) when additional specific property is identified or the amount of the money judgment has been calculated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Seizing Property.</em> The entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture authorizes the Attorney General (or a designee) to seize the specific property subject to forfeiture; to conduct any discovery the court considers proper in identifying, locating, or disposing of the property; and to commence proceedings that comply with any statutes governing third-party rights. The court may include in the order of forfeiture conditions reasonably necessary to preserve the property's value pending any appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Sentence and Judgment.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>When Final.</em> At sentencing&mdash;or at any time before sentencing if the defendant consents&mdash;the preliminary forfeiture order becomes final as to the defendant. If the order directs the defendant to forfeit specific property, it remains preliminary as to third parties until the ancillary proceeding is concluded under Rule 32.2(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Notice and Inclusion in the Judgment.</em> The court must include the forfeiture when orally announcing the sentence or must otherwise ensure that the defendant knows of the forfeiture at sentencing. The court must also include the forfeiture order, directly or by reference, in the judgment, but the court's failure to do so may be corrected at any time under Rule 36.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Time to Appeal.</em> The time for the defendant or the government to file an appeal from the forfeiture order, or from the court's failure to enter an order, begins to run when judgment is entered. If the court later amends or declines to amend a forfeiture order to include additional property under Rule 32.2(e), the defendant or the government may file an appeal regarding that property under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). The time for that appeal runs from the date when the order granting or denying the amendment becomes final.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Jury Determination.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Retaining the Jury.</em> In any case tried before a jury, if the indictment or information states that the government is seeking forfeiture, the court must determine before the jury begins deliberating whether either party requests that the jury be retained to determine the forfeitability of specific property if it returns a guilty verdict.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Special Verdict Form.</em> If a party timely requests to have the jury determine forfeiture, the government must submit a proposed Special Verdict Form listing each property subject to forfeiture and asking the jury to determine whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense committed by the defendant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Notice of the Forfeiture Order.</em></p>
<!-- PDFPage:128 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <em>Publishing and Sending Notice.</em> If the court orders the forfeiture of specific property, the government must publish notice of the order and send notice to any person who reasonably appears to be a potential claimant with standing to contest the forfeiture in the ancillary proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <em>Content of the Notice.</em> The notice must describe the forfeited property, state the times under the applicable statute when a petition contesting the forfeiture must be filed, and state the name and contact information for the government attorney to be served with the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <em>Means of Publication; Exceptions to Publication Requirement.</em> Publication must take place as described in Supplemental Rule G(4)(a)(iii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and may be by any means described in Supplemental Rule G(4)(a)(iv). Publication is unnecessary if any exception in Supplemental Rule G(4)(a)(i) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <em>Means of Sending the Notice.</em> The notice may be sent in accordance with Supplemental Rules G(4)(b)(iii)&ndash;(v) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <em>Interlocutory Sale.</em> At any time before entry of a final forfeiture order, the court, in accordance with Supplemental Rule G(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, may order the interlocutory sale of property alleged to be forfeitable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Ancillary Proceeding; Entering a Final Order of Forfeiture.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> If, as prescribed by statute, a third party files a petition asserting an interest in the property to be forfeited, the court must conduct an ancillary proceeding, but no ancillary proceeding is required to the extent that the forfeiture consists of a money judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the ancillary proceeding, the court may, on motion, dismiss the petition for lack of standing, for failure to state a claim, or for any other lawful reason. For purposes of the motion, the facts set forth in the petition are assumed to be true.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) After disposing of any motion filed under Rule 32.2(c)(1)(A) and before conducting a hearing on the petition, the court may permit the parties to conduct discovery in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the court determines that discovery is necessary or desirable to resolve factual issues. When discovery ends, a party may move for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Entering a Final Order.</em> When the ancillary proceeding ends, the court must enter a final order of forfeiture by amending the preliminary order as necessary to account for any third-party rights. If no third party files a timely petition, the preliminary order becomes the final order of forfeiture if the court finds that the defendant (or any combination of defendants convicted in the case) had an interest in the property that is forfeitable under the applicable statute. The defendant may not object to the entry of the final order on the ground that the property belongs, in whole or in part, to a codefendant or third party; nor may a third party object to the final order on the ground that the third party had an interest in the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Multiple Petitions.</em> If multiple third-party petitions are filed in the same case, an order dismissing or granting one petition is not appealable until rulings are made on all the petitions, unless the court determines that there is no just reason for delay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Ancillary Proceeding Not Part of Sentencing. </em>An ancillary proceeding is not part of sentencing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Stay Pending Appeal.</cap-smallcap> If a defendant appeals from a conviction or an order of forfeiture, the court may stay the order of forfeiture on terms appropriate to ensure that the property remains available pending appellate review. A stay does not delay the ancillary proceeding or the determination of a third party's rights or interests. If the court rules in favor of any third party while an appeal is pending, the court may amend the order of forfeiture but must not transfer any property interest to a third party until the decision on appeal becomes final, unless the defendant consents in writing or on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Subsequently Located Property; Substitute Property.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General.</em> On the government's motion, the court may at any time enter an order of forfeiture or amend an existing order of forfeiture to include property that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is subject to forfeiture under an existing order of forfeiture but was located and identified after that order was entered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is substitute property that qualifies for forfeiture under an applicable statute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Procedure.</em> If the government shows that the property is subject to forfeiture under Rule 32.2(e)(1), the court must:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) enter an order forfeiting that property, or amend an existing preliminary or final order to include it; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if a third party files a petition claiming an interest in the property, conduct an ancillary proceeding under Rule 32.2(c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Jury Trial Limited.</em> There is no right to a jury trial under Rule 32.2(e).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2000</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 32.2 consolidates a number of procedural rules governing the forfeiture of assets in a criminal case. Existing Rules 7(c)(2), 31(e) and 32(d)(2) are also amended to conform to the new rule. In addition, the forfeiture-related provisions of Rule 38(e) are stricken.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. Subdivision (a) is derived from Rule 7(c)(2) which provides that notwithstanding statutory authority for the forfeiture of property following a criminal conviction, no forfeiture order may be entered unless the defendant was given notice of the forfeiture in the indictment or information. As courts have held, subdivision (a) is not intended to require that an itemized list of the property to be forfeited appear in the indictment or information itself. The subdivision reflects the trend in caselaw interpreting present Rule 7(c). Under the most recent cases, Rule 7(c) sets forth a requirement that the government give the defendant no<!-- PDFPage:129 -->tice that it will be seeking forfeiture in accordance with the applicable statute. It does not require a substantive allegation in which the property subject to forfeiture, or the defendant's interest in the property, must be described in detail. <em>See United States v. DeFries</em>, 129 F.3d 1293 (D.C.Cir. 1997) (it is not necessary to specify in either the indictment or a bill of particulars that the government is seeking forfeiture of a particular asset, such as the defendant's salary; to comply with Rule 7(c), the government need only put the defendant on notice that it will seek to forfeit everything subject to forfeiture under the applicable statute, such as all property &ldquo;acquired or maintained&rdquo; as a result of a RICO violation). <em>See also United States v. Moffitt, Zwerling & Kemler, P.C</em>., 83 F.3d 660, 665 (4th Cir. 1996), <em>aff'g</em> 846 F. Supp. 463 (E.D. Va. 1994) (<em>Moffitt</em> I) (indictment need not list each asset subject to forfeiture; under Rule 7(c), this can be done with bill of particulars); <em>United States v. Voigt</em>, 89 F.3d 1050 (3rd Cir. 1996) (court may amend order of forfeiture at any time to include substitute assets).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)</em>. Subdivision (b) replaces Rule 31(e) which provides that the jury in a criminal case must return a special verdict &ldquo;as to the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture.&rdquo; <em>See United States v. Saccoccia</em>, 58 F.3d 754 (1st Cir. 1995) (Rule 31(e) only applies to jury trials; no special verdict required when defendant waives right to jury on forfeiture issues).</p>
<p class="note-body">One problem under Rule 31(e) concerns the scope of the determination that must be made prior to entering an order of forfeiture. This issue is the same whether the determination is made by the court or by the jury.</p>
<p class="note-body">As mentioned, the current rule requires the jury to return a special verdict &ldquo;as to the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture.&rdquo; Some courts interpret this to mean only that the jury must answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; when asked if the property named in the indictment is subject to forfeiture under the terms of the forfeiture statute&mdash;<em>e.g</em>. was the property used to facilitate a drug offense? Other courts also ask the jury if the defendant has a legal interest in the forfeited property. Still other courts, including the Fourth Circuit, require the jury to determine the <em>extent</em> of the defendant's interest in the property vis a vis third parties. <em>See United States v. Ham</em>, 58 F.3d 78 (4th Cir. 1995) (case remanded to the district court to impanel a jury to determine, in the first instance, the extent of the defendant's forfeitable interest in the subject property).</p>
<p class="note-body">The notion that the &ldquo;extent&rdquo; of the defendant's interest must be established as part of the criminal trial is related to the fact that criminal forfeiture is an <em>in personam</em> action in which only the defendant's interest in the property may be forfeited. <em>United States v. Riley</em>, 78 F.3d 367 (8th Cir. 1996). When the criminal forfeiture statutes were first enacted in the 1970's, it was clear that a forfeiture of property other than the defendant's could not occur in a criminal case, but there was no mechanism designed to limit the forfeiture to the defendant's interest. Accordingly, Rule 31(e) was drafted to make a determination of the &ldquo;extent&rdquo; of the defendant's interest part of the verdict.</p>
<p class="note-body">The problem is that third parties who might have an interest in the forfeited property are not parties to the criminal case. At the same time, a defendant who has no interest in property has no incentive, at trial, to dispute the government's forfeiture allegations. Thus, it was apparent by the 1980's that Rule 31(e) was an inadequate safeguard against the inadvertent forfeiture of property in which the defendant held no interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">In 1984, Congress addressed this problem when it enacted a statutory scheme whereby third party interests in criminally forfeited property are litigated by the court in an ancillary proceeding following the conclusion of the criminal case and the entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture. <em>See</em> 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(n); 18 U.S.C. &sect;1963(<em>l</em>). Under this scheme, the court orders the forfeiture of the defendant's interest in the property&mdash;whatever that interest may be&mdash;in the criminal case. At that point, the court conducts a separate proceeding in which all potential third party claimants are given an opportunity to challenge the forfeiture by asserting a superior interest in the property. This proceeding does not involve relitigation of the forfeitability of the property; its only purpose is to determine whether any third party has a legal interest in the forfeited property.</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice provisions regarding the ancillary proceeding are equivalent to the notice provisions that govern civil forfeitures. <em>Compare</em> 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(n)(1) <em>with</em> 19 U.S.C. &sect;1607(a); <em>see United States v. Bouler</em>, 927 F. Supp. 911 (W.D.N.C. 1996) (civil notice rules apply to ancillary criminal proceedings). Notice is published and sent to third parties that have a potential interest. <em>See United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. (In re Petition of Indosuez Bank</em>), 916 F. Supp. 1276 (D.D.C. 1996) (discussing steps taken by government to provide notice of criminal forfeiture to third parties). If no one files a claim, or if all claims are denied following a hearing, the forfeiture becomes final and the United States is deemed to have clear title to the property. 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(n)(7); <em>United States v. Hentz</em>, 1996 WL 355327 (E.D. Pa. June 20, 1996) (once third party fails to file a claim in the ancillary proceeding, government has clear title under &sect;853(n)(7) and can market the property notwithstanding third party's name on the deed).</p>
<p class="note-body">Thus, the ancillary proceeding has become the forum for determining the extent of the defendant's forfeitable interest in the property. This allows the court to conduct a proceeding in which all third party claimants can participate and which ensures that the property forfeited actually belongs to the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the enactment of the ancillary proceeding statutes, the requirement in Rule 31(e) that the court (or jury) determine the extent of the defendant's interest in the property as part of the criminal trial has become an unnecessary anachronism that leads more often than not to duplication and a waste of judicial resources. There is no longer any reason to delay the conclusion of the criminal trial with a lengthy hearing over the extent of the defendant's interest in property when the same issues will have to be litigated a second time in the ancillary proceeding if someone files a claim challenging the forfeiture. For example, in <em>United States v. Messino</em>, 917 F. Supp. 1307 (N.D. Ill. 1996), the court allowed the defendant to call witnesses to attempt to establish that they, not he, were the true owners of the property. After the jury rejected this evidence and the property was forfeited, the court conducted an ancillary proceeding in which the same witnesses litigated their claims to the same property.</p>
<p class="note-body">A more sensible procedure would be for the court, once it (or a jury) determines that property was involved in the criminal offense for which the defendant has been convicted, to order the forfeiture of whatever interest a defendant may have in the property without having to determine exactly what that interest is. If third parties assert that they have an interest in all or part of the property, those interests can be adjudicated at one time in the ancillary proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">This approach would also address confusion that occurs in multi-defendant cases where it is clear that each defendant should forfeit whatever interest he may have in the property used to commit the offense, but it is not at all clear which defendant is the actual owner of the property. For example, suppose A and B are co-defendants in a drug and money laundering case in which the government seeks to forfeit property involved in the scheme that is held in B's name but of which A may be the true owner. It makes no sense to invest the court's time in determining which of the two defendants holds the interest that should be forfeited. Both defendants should forfeit whatever interest they may have. Moreover, if under the current rule the court were to find that A is the true owner of the property, then B would have the right to file a claim in the ancillary proceeding where he may attempt to recover the property despite his criminal conviction. <em>United States v. Real Property in Waterboro</em>, 64 F.3d 752 (1st Cir. 1995) (co-defendant in drug/money laundering case who is not alleged to be the owner of the property is considered a <!-- PDFPage:130 -->third party for the purpose of challenging the forfeiture of the other co-defendant's interest).</p>
<p class="note-body">The new rule resolves these difficulties by postponing the determination of the extent of the defendant's interest until the ancillary proceeding. As provided in (b)(1), the court, as soon as practicable after the verdict or finding of guilty in the criminal case, would determine if the property was subject to forfeiture in accordance with the applicable statute, <em>e.g</em>., whether the property represented the proceeds of the offense, was used to facilitate the offense, or was involved in the offense in some other way. The determination could be made based on the evidence in the record from the criminal trial or the facts set forth in a written plea agreement submitted to the court at the time of the defendant's guilty plea, or the court could hold a hearing to determine if the requisite relationship existed between the property and the offense. Subdivision (b)(2) provides that it is not necessary to determine at this stage what interest any defendant might have in the property. Instead, the court would order the forfeiture of whatever interest each defendant might have in the property and conduct the ancillary proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(1) recognizes that there are different kinds of forfeiture judgments in criminal cases. One type is a personal judgment for a sum of money; another is a judgment forfeiting a specific asset. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Voigt</em>, 89 F.3d 1050 (3d Cir. 1996) (government is entitled to a personal money judgment equal to the amount involved in the money laundering offense, as well as order forfeiting specific assets involved in, or traceable to, the offense; in addition, if the statutory requirements are met, the government may be entitled to forfeit substitute assets); <em>United States v. Cleveland</em>, 1997 WL 537707 (E.D. La. Aug. 26, 1997), <em>modified</em>, 1997 WL 602186 (E.D. La. Sept. 29, 1997) (government entitled to a money judgment equal to the amount of money defendant laundered in money laundering case). The finding the court is required to make will depend on the nature of the forfeiture judgment. A number of cases have approved use of money judgment forfeitures. The Committee takes no position on the correctness of those rulings.</p>
<p class="note-body">To the extent that the government is seeking forfeiture of a particular asset, such as the money on deposit in a particular bank account that is alleged to be the proceeds of a criminal offense, or a parcel of land that is traceable to that offense, the court must find that the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense. To the extent that the government is seeking a money judgment, such as a judgment for the amount of money derived from a drug trafficking offense or the amount involved in a money laundering offense where the actual property subject to forfeiture has not been found or is unavailable, the court must determine the amount of money that the defendant should be ordered to forfeit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may make the determination based on evidence in the record, or on additional evidence submitted by the defendant or evidence submitted by the government in support of the motion for the entry of a judgment of forfeiture. The defendant would have no standing to object to the forfeiture on the ground that the property belonged to someone else.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subdivision (b)(2), if the court finds that property is forfeitable, it must enter a preliminary order of forfeiture. It also recognizes that any determination of a third person's interest in the property is deferred until an ancillary proceeding, if any, is held under subdivision (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(3) replaces Rule 32(d)(2) (effective December 1996). It provides that once the court enters a preliminary order of forfeiture directing the forfeiture of whatever interest each defendant may have in the forfeited property, the government may seize the property and commence an ancillary proceeding to determine the interests of any third party. The subdivision also provides that the Attorney General may designate someone outside of the Department of Justice to seize forfeited property. This is necessary because in cases in which the lead investigative agency is in the Treasury Department, for example, the seizure of the forfeited property is typically handled by agencies other than the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="note-body">If no third party files a claim, the court, at the time of sentencing, will enter a final order forfeiting the property in accordance with subdivision (c)(2), discussed <em>infra</em>. If a third party files a claim, the order of forfeiture will become final as to the defendant at the time of sentencing but will be subject to amendment in favor of a third party pending the conclusion of the ancillary proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the order of forfeiture becomes final as to the defendant at the time of sentencing, his right to appeal from that order begins to run at that time. As courts have held, because the ancillary hearing has no bearing on the defendant's right to the property, the defendant has no right to appeal when a final order is, or is not, amended to recognize third party rights. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Christunas</em>, 126 F.3d 765 (6th Cir. 1997) (preliminary order of forfeiture is final as to the defendant and is immediately appealable).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because it is not uncommon for sentencing to be postponed for an extended period to allow a defendant to cooperate with the government in an ongoing investigation, the rule would allow the order of forfeiture to become final as to the defendant before sentencing, if the defendant agrees to that procedure. Otherwise, the government would be unable to dispose of the property until the sentencing took place.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(4) addresses the right of either party to request that a jury make the determination of whether any property is subject to forfeiture. The provision gives the defendant, in all cases where a jury has returned a guilty verdict, the option of asking that the jury be retained to hear additional evidence regarding the forfeitability of the property. The only issue for the jury in such cases would be whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense. For example, if the defendant disputes the government's allegation that a parcel of real property is traceable to the offense, the defendant would have the right to request that the jury hear evidence on that issue, and return a special verdict, in a bifurcated proceeding that would occur after the jury returns the guilty verdict. The government would have the same option of requesting a special jury verdict on this issue, as is the case under current law. <em>See</em> Rule 23(a) (trial by jury may be waived only with the consent of the government).</p>
<p class="note-body">When Rule 31(e) was promulgated, it was assumed that criminal forfeiture was akin to a separate criminal offense on which evidence would be presented and the jury would have to return a verdict. In <em>Libretti v. United States</em>, 516 U.S. 29 (1995), however, the Supreme Court held that criminal forfeiture constitutes an aspect of the sentence imposed in a criminal case and that the defendant has no constitutional right to have the jury determine any part of the forfeiture. The special verdict requirement in Rule 31(e), the Court said, is in the nature of a statutory right that can be modified or repealed at any time.</p>
<p class="note-body">Even before <em>Libretti</em>, lower courts had determined that criminal forfeiture is a sentencing matter and concluded that criminal trials therefore should be bifurcated so that the jury first returns a verdict on guilt or innocence and then returns to hear evidence regarding the forfeiture. In the second part of the bifurcated proceeding, the jury is instructed that the government must establish the forfeitability of the property by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Myers</em>, 21 F.3d 826 (8th Cir. 1994) (preponderance standard applies because criminal forfeiture is part of the sentence in money laundering cases); <em>United States v. Voigt</em>, 89 F.3d 1050 (3rd Cir. 1996) (following <em>Myers</em>); <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 966 F.2d 1045, 1050&ndash;53 (6th Cir. 1992) (same for drug cases); <em>United States v. Bieri</em>, 21 F.3d 819 (8th Cir. 1994) (same).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although an argument could be made under <em>Libretti</em>, that a jury trial is no longer appropriate on any aspect <!-- PDFPage:131 -->of the forfeiture issue, which is a part of sentencing, the Committee decided to retain the right for the parties, in a trial held before a jury, to have the jury determine whether the government has established the requisite statutory nexus between the offense and the property to be forfeited. The jury, however, would not have any role in determining whether a defendant had an interest in the property to be forfeited. This is a matter for the ancillary proceeding which, by statute, is conducted &ldquo;before the court alone, without a jury.&rdquo; <em>See</em> 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(n)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (c)</em>. Subdivision (c) sets forth a set of rules governing the conduct of the ancillary proceeding. When the ancillary hearing provisions were added to 18 U.S.C. &sect;1963 and 21 U.S.C. &sect;853 in 1984, Congress apparently assumed that the proceedings under the new provisions would involve simple questions of ownership that could, in the ordinary case, be resolved in 30 days. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;1963(<em>l</em>)(4). Presumably for that reason, the statute contains no procedures governing motions practice or discovery such as would be available in an ordinary civil case. Subdivision (c)(1) makes clear that no ancillary proceeding is required to the extent that the order of forfeiture consists of a money judgment. A money judgment is an <em>in personam</em> judgment against the defendant and not an order directed at specific assets in which any third party could have any interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">Experience has shown that ancillary hearings can involve issues of enormous complexity that require years to resolve. <em>See United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A</em>., 833 F. Supp. 9 (D.D.C. 1993) (ancillary proceeding involving over 100 claimants and $451 million); <em>United States v. Porcelli</em>, CR&ndash;85&ndash;00756 (CPS), 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17928 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 1992) (litigation over third party claim continuing 6 years after RICO conviction). In such cases, procedures akin to those available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be available to the court and the parties to aid in the efficient resolution of the claims.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because an ancillary hearing is connected to a criminal case, it would not be appropriate to make the Civil Rules applicable in all respects. The amendment, however, describes several fundamental areas in which procedures analogous to those in the Civil Rules may be followed. These include the filing of a motion to dismiss a claim, conducting discovery, disposing of a claim on a motion for summary judgment, and appealing a final disposition of a claim. Where applicable, the amendment follows the prevailing case law on the issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lavin</em>, 942 F.2d 177 (3rd Cir. 1991) (ancillary proceeding treated as civil case for purposes of applying Rules of Appellate Procedure); <em>United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. (In re Petitions of General Creditors)</em>, 919 F. Supp. 31 (D.D.C. 1996) (&ldquo;If a third party fails to allege in its petition all elements necessary for recovery, including those relating to standing, the court may dismiss the petition without providing a hearing&rdquo;); <em>United States v. BCCI (Holdings) Luxembourg S.A. (In re Petition of Department of Private Affairs)</em>, 1993 WL 760232 (D.D.C. Dec. 8, 1993) (applying court's inherent powers to permit third party to obtain discovery from defendant in accordance with civil rules). The provision governing appeals in cases where there are multiple claims is derived from Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). <em>See also United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. (Petition of Banque Indosuez)</em>, 961 F. Supp. 282 (D.D.C. 1997) (in resolving motion to dismiss court assumes all facts pled by third party petitioner to be true, applying Rule 12(b)(6) and denying government's motion because whether claimant had superior title turned on factual dispute; government acted reasonably in not making any discovery requests in ancillary proceeding until court ruled on its motion to dismiss).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(2) provides for the entry of a final order of forfeiture at the conclusion of the ancillary proceeding. Under this provision, if no one files a claim in the ancillary proceeding, the preliminary order would become the final order of forfeiture, but the court would first have to make an independent finding that at least one of the defendants had an interest in the property such that it was proper to order the forfeiture of the property in a criminal case. In making that determination, the court may rely upon reasonable inferences. For example, the fact that the defendant used the property in committing the crime and no third party claimed an interest in the property may give rise to the inference that the defendant had a forfeitable interest in the property.</p>
<p class="note-body">This subdivision combines and preserves two established tenets of current law. One is that criminal forfeitures are <em>in personam</em> actions that are limited to the property interests of the defendant. (This distinguishes criminal forfeiture, which is imposed as part of the defendant's sentence, from civil forfeiture which may be pursued as an action against the property <em>in rem</em> without regard to who the owner may be.) The other tenet of current law is that if a third party has notice of the forfeiture but fails to file a timely claim, his or her interests are extinguished, and may not be recognized when the court enters the final order of forfeiture. <em>See United States v. Hentz</em>, 1996 WL 355327 (E.D. Pa. June 20, 1996) (once third party fails to file a claim in the ancillary proceeding, government has clear title under 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(n)(7) and can market the property notwithstanding third party's name on the deed). In the rare event that a third party claims that he or she was not afforded adequate notice of a criminal forfeiture action, the person may file a motion under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to reopen the ancillary proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bouler</em>, 927 F. Supp. 911 (W.D.N.C. 1996) (Rule 60(b) is the proper means by which a third party may move to reopen an ancillary proceeding).</p>
<p class="note-body">If no third parties assert their interests in the ancillary proceeding, the court must nonetheless determine that the defendant, or combination of defendants, had an interest in the property. Criminal defendants may be jointly and severally liable for the forfeiture of the entire proceeds of the criminal offense. <em>See United States v. Hurley</em>, 63 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1995) (government can collect the proceeds only once, but subject to that cap, it can collect from any defendant so much of the proceeds as was foreseeable to that defendant); <em>United States v. Cleveland</em>, 1997 WL 602186 (E.D. La. Sept. 29, 1997) (same); <em>United States v. McCarroll</em>, 1996 WL 355371 at *9 (N.D. Ill. June 25, 1996) (following <em>Hurley</em>), <em>aff'd sub nom. United States v. Jarrett</em>, 133 F.3d 519 (7th Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. DeFries</em>, 909 F. Supp. 13, 19&ndash;20 (D.D.C. 1995) (defendants are jointly and severally liable even where government is able to determine precisely how much each defendant benefitted from the scheme), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, 129 F.3d 1293 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Therefore, the conviction of any of the defendants is sufficient to support the forfeiture of the entire proceeds of the offense, even if the defendants have divided the money among themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body">As noted in (c)(4), the ancillary proceeding is not considered a part of sentencing. Thus, the Federal Rules of Evidence would apply to the ancillary proceeding, as is the case currently.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (d)</em>. Subdivision (d) replaces the forfeiture provisions of Rule 38(e) which provide that the court may stay an order of forfeiture pending appeal. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that the property remains intact and unencumbered so that it may be returned to the defendant in the event the appeal is successful. Subdivision (d) makes clear, however, that a district court is not divested of jurisdiction over an ancillary proceeding even if the defendant appeals his or her conviction. This allows the court to proceed with the resolution of third party claims even as the appellate court considers the appeal. Otherwise, third parties would have to await the conclusion of the appellate process even to begin to have their claims heard. <em>See United States v. Messino</em>, 907 F. Supp. 1231 (N.D. Ill. 1995) (the district court retains jurisdiction over forfeiture matters while an appeal is pending).</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, subdivision (d) provides a rule to govern what happens if the court determines that a third-<!-- PDFPage:132 -->party claim should be granted but the defendant's appeal is still pending. The defendant is barred from filing a claim in the ancillary proceeding. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. &sect;1963(<em>l</em>)(2); 21 U.S.C. &sect;853(n)(2). Thus, the court's determination, in the ancillary proceeding, that a third party has an interest in the property superior to that of the defendant cannot be binding on the defendant. So, in the event that the court finds in favor of the third party, that determination is final only with respect to the government's alleged interest. If the defendant prevails on appeal, he or she recovers the property as if no conviction or forfeiture ever took place. But if the order of forfeiture is affirmed, the amendment to the order of forfeiture in favor of the third party becomes effective.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (e)</em>. Subdivision (e) makes clear, as courts have found, that the court retains jurisdiction to amend the order of forfeiture at any time to include subsequently located property which was originally included in the forfeiture order and any substitute property. <em>See United States v. Hurley</em>, 63 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1995) (court retains authority to order forfeiture of substitute assets after appeal is filed); <em>United States v. Voigt</em>, 89 F.3d 1050 (3rd Cir. 1996) (following <em>Hurley</em>). Third parties, of course, may contest the forfeiture of substitute assets in the ancillary proceeding. <em>See United States v. Lester</em>, 85 F.3d 1409 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(1) makes clear that the right to a bifurcated jury trial to determine whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense, <em>see</em> (b)(4), does not apply to the forfeiture of substitute assets or to the addition of newly-discovered property to an existing order of forfeiture. It is well established in the case law that the forfeiture of substitute assets is solely an issue for the court. <em>See United States v. Hurley</em>, 63 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1995) (court retains authority to order forfeiture of substitute assets after appeal is filed); <em>United States v. Voigt</em>, 89 F.3d 1050 (3d Cir. 1996) (following <em>Hurley</em>; court may amend order of forfeiture at any time to include substitute assets); <em>United States v. Thompson</em>, 837 F. Supp. 585 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (court, not jury, orders forfeiture of substitute assets). As a practical matter, courts have also determined that they, not the jury, must determine the forfeitability of assets discovered after the trial is over and the jury has been dismissed. <em>See United States v. Saccoccia</em>, 898 F. Supp. 53 (D.R.I. 1995) (government may conduct post-trial discovery to determine location and identity of forfeitable assets; post-trial discovery resulted in discovery of gold bars buried in defendant's mother's backyard several years after the entry of an order directing the defendant to forfeit all property, up to $137 million, involved in his money laundering offense).</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>GAP Report&mdash;Rule 32.2.</strong> The Committee amended the rule to clarify several key points. First, subdivision (b) was redrafted to make it clear that if no third party files a petition to assert property rights, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has an interest in the property to be forfeited and the extent of that interest. As published, the rule would have permitted the trial judge to order the defendant to forfeit the property in its entirety if no third party filed a claim.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, Rule 32.2(c)(4) was added to make it clear that the ancillary proceeding is not a part of sentencing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, the Committee clarified the procedures to be used if the government (1) discovers property subject to forfeiture after the court has entered an order of forfeiture and (2) seeks the forfeiture of &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; property under a statute authorizing such substitution.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 32.2 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (a)</em>. The amendment responds to some uncertainty regarding the form of the required notice that the government will seek forfeiture as part of the sentence, making it clear that the notice should not be designated as a separate count in an indictment or information. The amendment also makes it clear that the indictment or information need only provide general notice that the government is seeking forfeiture, without identifying the specific property being sought. This is consistent with the 2000 Committee Note, as well as many lower court decisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although forfeitures are not charged as counts, the federal judiciary's Case Management and Electronic Case Files system should note that forfeiture has been alleged so as to assist the parties and the court in tracking the subsequent status of forfeiture allegations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The court may direct the government to file a bill of particulars to inform the defendant of the identity of the property that the government is seeking to forfeit or the amount of any money judgment sought if necessary to enable the defendant to prepare a defense or to avoid unfair surprise. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Moffitt, Zwerdling, & Kemler, P.C.</em>, 83 F.3d 660, 665 (4th Cir. 1996) (holding that the government need not list each asset subject to forfeiture in the indictment because notice can be provided in a bill of particulars); <em>United States v. Vasquez-Ruiz</em>, 136 F. Supp. 2d 941, 944 (N.D. Ill. 2001) (directing the government to identify in a bill of particulars, at least 30 days before trial, the specific items of property, including substitute assets, that it claims are subject to forfeiture); <em>United States v. Best</em>, 657 F. Supp. 1179, 1182 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (directing the government to provide a bill of particulars apprising the defendants as to the time periods during which they obtained the specified classes of property through their alleged racketeering activity and the interest in each of these properties that was allegedly obtained unlawfully). <em>See also United States v. Columbo</em>, 2006 WL 2012511 * 5 & n.13 (S.D. N.Y. 2006) (denying motion for bill of particulars and noting that government proposed sending letter detailing basis for forfeiture allegations).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)</em>. Rule 32.2(b)(1) sets forth the procedure for determining if property is subject to forfeiture. Subparagraph (A) is carried forward from the current Rule without change.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subparagraph (B) clarifies that the parties may submit additional evidence relating to the forfeiture in the forfeiture phase of the trial, which may be necessary even if the forfeiture is not contested. Subparagraph (B) makes it clear that in determining what evidence or information should be accepted, the court should consider relevance and reliability. Finally, subparagraph (B) requires the court to hold a hearing when forfeiture is contested. The Committee foresees that in some instances live testimony will be needed to determine the reliability of proffered information. <em>Cf</em>. Rule 32.1(b)(1)(B)(iii) (providing the defendant in a proceeding for revocation of probation or supervised release with the opportunity, upon request, to question any adverse witness unless the judge determines this is not in the interest of justice).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)(A)</em>. Current Rule 32.2(b) provides the procedure for issuing a preliminary forfeiture order once the court finds that the government has established the nexus between the property and the offense (or the amount of the money judgment). The amendment makes clear that the preliminary order may include substitute assets if the government has met the statutory criteria.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)(B)</em>. This new subparagraph focuses on the timing of the preliminary forfeiture order, stating that the court should issue the order &ldquo;sufficiently in advance of sentencing to allow the parties to suggest revisions or modifications before the order becomes final.&rdquo; Many courts have delayed entry of the preliminary order until the time of sentencing. This is unde<!-- PDFPage:133 -->sirable because the parties have no opportunity to advise the court of omissions or errors in the order before it becomes final as to the defendant (which occurs upon oral announcement of the sentence and the entry of the criminal judgment). Once the sentence has been announced, the rules give the sentencing court only very limited authority to correct errors or omissions in the preliminary forfeiture order. Pursuant to Rule 35(a), the district court may correct a sentence, including an incorporated forfeiture order, within seven days after oral announcement of the sentence. During the seven-day period, corrections are limited to those necessary to correct &ldquo;arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.&rdquo; <em>See United States v. King</em>, 368 F. Supp. 2d 509, 512&ndash;13 (D.S.C. 2005). Corrections of clerical errors may also be made pursuant to Rule 36. If the order contains errors or omissions that do not fall within Rules 35(a) or 36, and the court delays entry of the preliminary forfeiture order until the time of sentencing, the parties may be left with no alternative to an appeal, which is a waste of judicial resources. The amendment requires the court to enter the preliminary order in advance of sentencing to permit time for corrections, unless it is not practical to do so in an individual case.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(2)(C)</em>. The amendment explains how the court is to reconcile the requirement that it make the forfeiture order part of the sentence with the fact that in some cases the government will not have completed its post-conviction investigation to locate the forfeitable property by the time of sentencing. In that case the court is authorized to issue a forfeiture order describing the property in &ldquo;general&rdquo; terms, which order may be amended pursuant to Rule 32.2(e)(1) when additional specific property is identified.</p>
<p class="note-body">The authority to issue a general forfeiture order should be used only in unusual circumstances and not as a matter of course. For cases in which a general order was properly employed, see <em>United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg)</em>, 69 F. Supp. 2d 36 (D.D.C. 1999) (ordering forfeiture of all of a large, complex corporation's assets in the United States, permitting the government to continue discovery necessary to identify and trace those assets); <em>United States v. Saccoccia</em>, 898 F. Supp. 53 (D.R.I. 1995) (ordering forfeiture of up to a specified amount of laundered drug proceeds so that the government could continue investigation which led to the discovery and forfeiture of gold bars buried by the defendant in his mother's back yard).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b)(3) and (4)</em>. The amendment moves the language explaining when the forfeiture order becomes final as to the defendant to new subparagraph (b)(4)(A), where it is coupled with new language explaining that the order is not final as to third parties until the completion of the ancillary proceedings provided for in Rule 32.2(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">New subparagraphs (B) and (C) are intended to clarify what the district court is required to do at sentencing, and to respond to conflicting decisions in the courts regarding the application of Rule 36 to correct clerical errors. The new subparagraphs add considerable detail regarding the oral announcement of the forfeiture at sentencing, the reference to the forfeiture order in the judgment and commitment order, the availability of Rule 36 to correct the failure to include the forfeiture order in the judgment and commitment order, and the time to appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">New subparagraph (C) clarifies the time for appeals concerning forfeiture by the defendant or government from two kinds of orders: the original judgment of conviction and later orders amending or refusing to amend the judgment under Rule 32.2(e) to add additional property. This provision does not address appeals by the government or a third party from orders in ancillary proceedings under Rule 32.2(c).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(5)(A)</em>. The amendment clarifies the procedure for requesting a jury determination of forfeiture. The goal is to avoid an inadvertent waiver of the right to a jury determination, while also providing timely notice to the court and to the jurors themselves if they will be asked to make the forfeiture determination. The amendment requires that the court determine whether either party requests a jury determination of forfeiture in cases where the government has given notice that it is seeking forfeiture and a jury has been empaneled to determine guilt or innocence. The rule requires the court to make this determination before the jury retires. Jurors who know that they may face an additional task after they return their verdict will be more accepting of the additional responsibility in the forfeiture proceeding, and the court will be better able to plan as well.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although the rule permits a party to make this request just before the jury retires, it is desirable, when possible, to make the request earlier, at the time when the jury is empaneled. This allows the court to plan, and also allows the court to tell potential jurors what to expect in terms of their service.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(5)(B)</em> explains that &ldquo;the government must submit a proposed Special Verdict Form listing each property subject to forfeiture.&rdquo; Use of such a form is desirable, and the government is in the best position to draft the form.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivisions (b)(6) and (7)</em>. These provisions are based upon the civil forfeiture provisions in Supplemental Rule G of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which are also incorporated by cross reference. The amendment governs such mechanical and technical issues as the manner of publishing notice of forfeiture to third parties and the interlocutory sale of property, bringing practice under the Criminal Rules into conformity with the Civil Rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment</em>. The proposed amendment to Rule 32.2 was modified to use the term &ldquo;property&rdquo; throughout. As published, the proposed amendment used the terms property and asset(s) interchangeably. No difference in meaning was intended, and in order to avoid confusion, a single term was used consistently throughout. The term &ldquo;forfeiture order&rdquo; was substituted, where possible, for the wordier &ldquo;order of forfeiture.&rdquo; Other small stylistic changes (such as the insertion of &ldquo;the&rdquo; in subpart titles) were also made to conform to the style conventions.</p>
<p class="note-body">In new subpart (b)(4)(C), dealing with the time for appeals, the words &ldquo;the defendant or the government&rdquo; were substituted for the phrase &ldquo;a party.&rdquo; This portion of the rule addresses only appeals from the original judgment of conviction and later orders amending or refusing to amend the judgment under Rule 32.2(e) to add additional property. Only the defendant and the government are parties at this stage of the proceedings. This portion of the rule does not address appeals by the government or a third party from orders in ancillary proceedings under Rule 32.2(c). This point was also clarified in the Committee note.</p>
<p class="note-body">Additionally, two other changes were made to the Committee Note: a reference to the use of the ECF system to aid the court and parties in tracking the status of forfeiture allegations, and an additional illustrative case.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments to the first two sentences make it clear that a judge has no power to order a new trial on his own motion, that he can act only in response to a motion timely made by a defendant. Problems of double jeopardy arise when the court acts on its own motion. See <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 331 U.S. 469 (1947). These amendments do not, of course, change the power which the court has in certain circumstances, prior to verdict or finding of guilty, to declare a mistrial and order a new trial on its own motion. See e.g., <em>Gori v. United States</em>, 367 U.S. 364 (1961); <em>Downum v. United States</em>, 372 U.S. 734 (1963); <em>United States v. Tateo</em>, 377 U.S. 463 (1964). The amendment to the last sentence changes the time in which the motion may be made to 7 days. See the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 29.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">As currently written, the time for filing a motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence runs from the &ldquo;final judgment.&rdquo; The courts, in interpreting that language, have uniformly concluded that that language refers to the action of the Court of Appeals. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Reyes</em>, 49 F.3d 63, 66 (2d Cir. 1995)(citing cases). It is less clear whether that action is the appellate court's judgment or the issuance of its mandate. In <em>Reyes</em>, the court concluded that it was the latter event. In either case, it is clear that the present approach of using the appellate court's final judgment as the triggering event can cause great disparity in the amount of time available to a defendant to file timely a motion for new trial. This would be especially true if, as noted by the Court in <em>Reyes, supra</em> at 67, an appellate court stayed its mandate pending review by the Supreme Court. <em>See also Herrera v. Collins</em>, 506 U.S. 390, 410&ndash;412 (1993) (noting divergent treatment by States of time for filing motions for new trial).</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the intent of the Committee to remove that element of inconsistency by using the trial court's verdict or finding of guilty as the triggering event. The change also furthers internal consistency within the rule itself; the time for filing a motion for new trial on any other ground currently runs from that same event.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the time to file a motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence is increased to three years to compensate for what would have otherwise resulted in less time than that currently contemplated in the rule for filing such motions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 33 After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Advisory Committee changed the proposed amendment to require that any motions for new trials based upon newly discovered evidence must be filed within <em>three</em> years, instead of two years, from the date of the verdict. The Committee also incorporated changes offered by the Style Subcommittee.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 33 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 33(b)(2) has been amended to remove the requirement that the court must act within seven days after a verdict or finding of guilty if it sets another time for filing a motion for a new trial. This amendment parallels similar changes to Rules 29 and 34. Further, a conforming amendment has been made to Rule 45(b)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">Currently, Rule 33(b)(2) requires the defendant to move for a new trial within seven days after the verdict or the finding of guilty verdict, or within some other time set by the court in an order issued during that same seven-day period. Similar provisions exist in Rules 29 and 34. Courts have held that the seven-day rule is jurisdictional. Thus, if a defendant files a request for an extension of time to file a motion for a new trial within the seven-day period, the court must rule on that motion or request within the same seven-day period. If for some reason the court does not rule on the request within the seven days, it loses jurisdiction to act on the underlying substantive motion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith</em>, 331 U.S. 469, 473&ndash;474 (1947) (rejecting argument that trial court had power to grant new trial on its own motion after expiration of time in Rule 33); <em>United States v.

<p class="note-body">Assuming that the current rule was intended to promote finality, there is nothing to prevent the court from granting the defendant a significant extension of time, so long as it does so within the seven-day period.

The defendant may, under Rule 45, seek an extension of time to file the underlying motion as long as the defendant does so within the seven-day period. But the court itself is not required to act on that motion within any particular time. Further, under Rule 45(b)(1)(B), if for some reason the defendant fails to file the underlying motion for new trial within the specified time, the court may nonetheless consider that untimely underlying motion if the court determines that the failure to file it on time was the result of excusable neglect.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;on motion of a defendant&rdquo; are added to make clear here, as in Rule 33, that the court may act only pursuant to a timely motion by the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to the second sentence is designed to clarify an ambiguity in the rule as originally drafted. In <em>Lott v. United States</em>, 367 U.S. 421 (1961) the Supreme Court held that when a defendant pleaded nolo contendere the time in which a motion could be made under this rule did not begin to run until entry of the judgment. The Court held that such a plea was not a &ldquo;determination of guilty.&rdquo; No reason of policy appears to justify having the time for making this motion commence with the verdict or finding of guilt but not with the acceptance of the plea of nolo contendere or the plea of guilty. The amendment changes the result in the <em>Lott</em> case and makes the periods uniform. The amendment also changes the time in which the motion may be made to 7 days. See the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 29.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 34 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2005 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 34(b) has been amended to remove the requirement that the court must act within seven days after the court accepts a verdict or finding of guilty, or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere if it sets another time for filing a motion to arrest a judgment. The amendment parallels similar amendments to Rules 29 and 33. Further, a conforming amendment has been made to Rule 45(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Currently, Rule 34(b) requires the defendant to move to arrest judgment within seven days after the court accepts a verdict or finding of guilty, or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or within some other time set by the court in an order issued by the court within that same seven-day period. Similar provisions exist in Rules 29 and 33. Courts have held that the seven-day rule is jurisdictional. Thus, if a defendant files a request for an extension of time to file a motion to arrest judgment within the seven-day period, the judge must rule on that motion or request within the same seven-day period. If for some reason the court does not rule on the request within the seven days, the court loses jurisdiction to act on the underlying substantive motion, if it is not filed within the seven days. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith</em>, 331 U.S. 469, 473&ndash;474 (1947) (rejecting argument that trial court had power to grant new trial on its own motion after expiration of time in Rule 33); <em>United States v. Marquez</em>, 291 F.3d 23, 27&ndash;28 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing language of Rule 33, and holding that &ldquo;district court forfeited the power to act when it failed to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fix a new time for filing a motion for a new trial within seven days of the verdict&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">Assuming that the current rule was intended to promote finality, there is nothing to prevent the court from granting the defendant a significant extension of time, so long as it does so within the seven-day period. Thus, the Committee believed that the rule should be amended to be consistent with all of the other timing requirements in the rules, which do not force the court to rule on a motion to extend the time for filing within a particular period of time or lose jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, the amendment deletes the language regarding the court's acting within seven days to set the time for filing. Read in conjunction with the conforming amendment to Rule 45(b), the defendant is still required to file a timely motion to arrest judgment under Rule 34 within the seven-day period specified. The defendant may, under Rule 45, seek an extension of time to file the underlying motion as long as the defendant does so within the seven-day period. But the court itself is not required to act on that motion within any particular time.

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of the rule continues existing law. The second sentence introduces a flexible time limitation on the power of the court to reduce a sentence, in lieu of the present limitation of the term of court. Rule 45(c) abolishes the expiration of a term of court as a time limitation, thereby necessitating the introduction of a specific time limitation as to all proceedings now governed by the term of court as a limitation. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 6(c)) [28 U.S.C., Appendix], abolishes the term of court as a time limitation in respect to civil actions. The two rules together thus do away with the significance of the expiration of a term of court which has largely become an anachronism.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to the first sentence gives the court power to correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within the same time limits as those provided for reducing a sentence. In <em>Hill v. United States</em>, 368 U.S. 424 (1962) the court held that a motion to correct an illegal sentence was not an appropriate way for a defendant to raise the question whether when he appeared for sentencing the court had afforded him an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf as required by Rule 32(a). The amendment recognizes the distinction between an illegal sentence, which may be corrected at any time, and a sentence imposed in an illegal manner, and provides a limited time for correcting the latter.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence has been amended to increase the time within which the court may act from 60 days to 120 days. The 60-day period is frequently too short to enable the defendant to obtain and file the evidence, information and argument to support a reduction in sentence. Especially where a defendant has been committed to an institution at a distance from the sentencing court, the delays involved in institutional mail inspection procedures and the time required to contact relatives, friends and counsel may result in the 60-day period passing before the court is able to consider the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other amendments to the second sentence clarify ambiguities in the timing provisions. In those cases in which the mandate of the court of appeals is issued prior to action by the Supreme Court on the defendant's petition for certiorari, the rule created problems in three situations: (1) If the writ were denied, the last phrase of the rule left obscure the point at which the period began to run because orders of the Supreme Court denying applications for writs are not sent to the district courts. See <em>Johnson v. United States</em>, 235 F.2d 459 (5th Cir. 1956). (2) If the writ were granted but later dismissed as improvidently granted, the rule did not provide any time period for reduction of sentence. (3) If the writ were granted and later the Court affirmed a judgment of the court of appeals which had affirmed the conviction, the rule did not provide any time period for reduction of sentence. The amendment makes it clear that in each of these three situations the 120-period commences to run with the entry of the order or judgment of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third sentence has been added to make it clear that the time limitation imposed by Rule 35 upon the reduction of a sentence does not apply to such reduction upon the revocation of probation as authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3653.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 35 is amended in order to make it clear that a judge may, in his discretion, reduce a sentence of incarceration to probation. To the extent that this permits the judge to grant probation to a defendant who has already commenced service of a term of imprisonment, it represents a change in the law. See <em>United States v. Murray</em>, 275 U.S. 347 (1928) (Probation Act construed not to give power to district court to grant probation to convict after beginning of service of sentence, even in the same term of court); <em>Affronti v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 79 (1955) (Probation Act construed to mean that after a sentence of consecutive terms on multiple counts of an indictment has been imposed and service of sentence for the first such term has commenced, the district court may not suspend sentence and grant probation as to the remaining term or terms). In construing the statute in <em>Murray</em> and <em>Affronti</em>, the Court concluded Congress could not have intended to make the probation provisions applicable during the entire period of incarceration (the only other conceivable interpretation of the statute), for this would result in undue duplication of the three methods of mitigating a sentence&mdash;probation, pardon and parole&mdash;and would impose upon district judges the added burden of responding to probation applications from prisoners throughout the service of their terms of imprisonment. Those concerns do not apply to the instant provisions, for the reduction may occur only within the time specified in subdivision (b). This change gives &ldquo;meaningful effect&rdquo; to the motion-to-reduce remedy by allowing the court &ldquo;to consider all alternatives that were available at the time of imposition of the original sentence.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Golphin</em>, 362 F.Supp. 698 (W.D.Pa. 1973).</p>
<p class="note-body">Should the reduction to a sentence of probation occur after the defendant has been incarcerated more than six months, this would put into issue the applicability of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3651, which provides that initially the court &ldquo;may impose a sentence in excess of six months and provide that the defendant be confined in a jail-type institution for a period not exceeding six months and that the execution of the remainder of the sentence be suspended and the defendant placed on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems best.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). There is currently a split of authority on the question of whether a court may re<!-- PDFPage:137 -->duce a sentence within 120 days after revocation of probation when the sentence was imposed earlier but execution of the sentence had in the interim been suspended in part or in its entirety. Compare <em>United States v. Colvin</em>, 644 F.2d 703 (8th Cir. 1981) (yes); <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 634 F.2d 94 (3d Cir. 1980) (yes); with <em>United States v. Rice</em>, 671 F.2d 455 (11th Cir. 1982) (no); <em>United States v. Kahane</em>, 527 F.2d 491 (2d Cir. 1975) (no). The Advisory Committee believes that the rule should be clarified in light of this split, and has concluded that as a policy matter the result reached in <em>Johnson</em> is preferable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court declared in <em>Korematsu v. United States</em>, 319 U.S. 432, 435 (1943), that &ldquo;the difference to the probationer between imposition of sentence followed by probation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and suspension of the imposition of sentence [followed by probation]&rdquo; is not a meaningful one. When imposition of sentence is suspended entirely at the time a defendant is placed on probation, that defendant has 120 days after revocation of probation and imposition of sentence to petition for leniency. The amendment to subdivision (b) makes it clear that similar treatment is to be afforded probationers for whom execution, rather than imposition, of sentence was originally suspended.</p>
<p class="note-body">The change facilitates the underlying objective of rule 35, which is to &ldquo;give every convicted defendant a second round before the sentencing judge, and [afford] the judge an opportunity to reconsider the sentence in the light of any further information about the defendant or the case which may have been presented to him in the interim.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Ellenbogan</em>, 390 F.2d 537, 543 (2d Cir. 1968). It is only technically correct that a reduction may be sought when a suspended sentence is imposed. As noted in <em>Johnson</em>, supra, at 96:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;It frequently will be unrealistic for a defendant whose sentence has just been suspended to petition the court for the further relief of a reduction of that suspended sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">Just as significant, we doubt that sentencing judges would be very receptive to Rule 35 motions proffered at the time the execution of a term of imprisonment is suspended in whole or in part and the defendant given a term of probation. Moreover, the sentencing judge cannot know of events that might occur later and that might bear on what would constitute an appropriate term of imprisonment should the defendant violate his probation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In particular, it is only with the revocation hearing that the judge is in a position to consider whether a sentence originally suspended pending probation should be reduced. The revocation hearing is thus the first point at which an offender can be afforded a realistic opportunity to plead for a light sentence. If the offender is to be provided two chances with the sentencing judge, to be meaningful this second sentence must occur subsequent to the revocation hearing.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). This amendment to Rule 35(b) conforms its language to the nonliteral interpretation which most courts have already placed upon the rule, namely, that it suffices that the defendant's motion was made within the 120 days and that the court determines the motion within a reasonable time thereafter. <em>United States v. DeMier</em>, 671 F.2d 1200 (8th Cir. 1982); <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 650 F.2d 206 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 634 F.2d 94 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Mendoza</em>, 581 F.2d 89 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States V. Stollings</em>, 516 F.2d 1287 (4th Cir. 1975). Despite these decisions, a change in the language is deemed desirable to remove any doubt which might arise from dictum in some cases, e.g., <em>United States v. Addonizio</em>, 442 U.S. 178, 189 (1979), that Rule 35 only &ldquo;authorizes District Courts to reduce a sentence within 120 days&rdquo; and that this time period &ldquo;is jurisdictional, and may not be extended.&rdquo; See <em>United States v. Kajevic</em>, 711 F.2d 767 (7th Cir. 1983), following the <em>Addonizio</em> dictum.</p>
<p class="note-body">As for the &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; limitation, reasonableness in this context &ldquo;must be evaluated in light of the policies supporting the time limitations and the reasons for the delay in each case.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Smith, supra</em>, at 209. The time runs &ldquo;at least for so long as the judge reasonably needs time to consider and act upon the motion.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Stollings, supra</em>, at 1288.</p>
<p class="note-body">In some instances the court may decide to reduce a sentence even though no motion seeking such action is before the court. When that is the case, the amendment makes clear, the reduction must actually occur within the time specified.</p>
<p class="note-body">This amendment does not preclude the filing of a motion by a defendant for further reduction of sentence after the court has reduced a sentence on its own motion, if filed within the 120 days specified in this rule.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1991 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 35(b), as amended in 1987 as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, reflects a method by which the government may obtain valuable assistance from defendants in return for an agreement to file a motion to reduce the sentence, even if the reduction would reduce the sentence below the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body">The title of subsection (b) has been amended to reflect that there is a difference between correcting an illegal or improper sentence, as in subsection (a), and reducing an otherwise legal sentence for special reasons under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the 1987 amendment, the trial court was required to rule on the government's motion to reduce a defendant's sentence within one year after imposition of the sentence. This caused problems, however, in situations where the defendant's assistance could not be fully assessed in time to make a timely motion which could be ruled upon before one year had elapsed. The amendment requires the government to make its motion to reduce the sentence before one year has elapsed but does not require the court to rule on the motion within the one year limit. This change should benefit both the government and the defendant and will permit completion of the defendant's anticipated cooperation with the government. Although no specific time limit is set on the court's ruling on the motion to reduce the sentence, the burden nonetheless rests on the government to request and justify a delay in the court's ruling.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also recognizes that there may be those cases where the defendant's assistance or cooperation may not occur until after one year has elapsed. For example, the defendant may not have obtained information useful to the government until after the time limit had passed. In those instances the trial court in its discretion may consider what would otherwise be an untimely motion if the government establishes that the cooperation could not have been furnished within the one-year time limit. In deciding whether to consider an untimely motion, the court may, for example, consider whether the assistance was provided as early as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is intended to adopt, in part, a suggestion from the Federal Courts Study Committee 1990 that Rule 35 be amended to recognize explicitly the ability of the sentencing court to correct a sentence imposed as a result of an obvious arithmetical, technical or other clear error, if the error is discovered shortly after the sentence is imposed. At least two courts of appeals have held that the trial court has the inherent authority, notwithstanding the repeal of former Rule 35(a) by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, to correct a sentence within the time allowed for sentence appeal by any party under 18 U.S.C. 3742. <em>See United States v. Cook</em>, 890 F.2d 672 (4th Cir. 1989) (error in applying sentencing guidelines); <em>United States v. Rico</em>, 902 F.2d 1065 (2nd Cir. 1990) (failure to impose prison sentence required by terms of plea agreement). The amendment in effect codifies the result in those two cases but provides a more stringent time requirement. The Committee believed that the time for correcting <!-- PDFPage:138 -->such errors should be narrowed within the time for appealing the sentence to reduce the likelihood of jurisdictional questions in the event of an appeal and to provide the parties with an opportunity to address the court's correction of the sentence, or lack thereof, in any appeal of the sentence. A shorter period of time would also reduce the likelihood of abuse of the rule by limiting its application to acknowledged and obvious errors in sentencing.</p>
<p class="note-body">The authority to correct a sentence under this subdivision is intended to be very narrow and to extend only to those cases in which an obvious error or mistake has occurred in the sentence, that is, errors which would almost certainly result in a remand of the case to the trial court for further action under Rule 35(a). The subdivision is not intended to afford the court the opportunity to reconsider the application or interpretation of the sentencing guidelines or for the court simply to change its mind about the appropriateness of the sentence. Nor should it be used to reopen issues previously resolved at the sentencing hearing through the exercise of the court's discretion with regard to the application of the sentencing guidelines. Furthermore, the Committee did not intend that the rule relax any requirement that the parties state all objections to a sentence at or before the sentencing hearing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jones</em>, 899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="note-body">The subdivision does not provide for any formalized method of bringing the error to the attention of the court and recognizes that the court could <em>sua sponte</em> make the correction. Although the amendment does not expressly address the issue of advance notice to the parties or whether the defendant should be present in court for resentencing, the Committee contemplates that the court will act in accordance with Rules 32 and 43 with regard to any corrections in the sentence. <em>Compare United States v. Cook, supra</em> (court erred in correcting sentence <em>sua sponte</em> in absence of defendant) with <em>United States v. Rico, supra</em> (court heard arguments on request by government to correct sentence). The Committee contemplates that the court would enter an order correcting the sentence and that such order must be entered within the seven (7) day period so that the appellate process (if a timely appeal is taken) may proceed without delay and without jurisdictional confusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 35(c) provides an efficient and prompt method for correcting obvious technical errors that are called to the court's attention immediately after sentencing. But the addition of this subdivision is not intended to preclude a defendant from obtaining statutory relief from a plainly illegal sentence. The Committee's assumption is that a defendant detained pursuant to such a sentence could seek relief under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2255 if the seven day period provided in Rule 35(c) has elapsed. Rule 35(c) and &sect;2255 should thus provide sufficient authority for a district court to correct obvious sentencing errors.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee considered, but rejected, a proposal from the Federal Courts Study Committee to permit modification of a sentence, within 120 days of sentencing, based upon new factual information not known to the defendant at the time of sentencing. Unlike the proposed subdivision (c) which addresses obvious technical mistakes, the ability of the defendant (and perhaps the government) to come forward with new evidence would be a significant step toward returning Rule 35 to its former state. The Committee believed that such a change would inject into Rule 35 a degree of postsentencing discretion which would raise doubts about the finality of determinate sentencing that Congress attempted to resolve by eliminating former Rule 35(a). It would also tend to confuse the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals in those cases in which a timely appeal is taken with respect to the sentence. Finally, the Committee was not persuaded by the available evidence that a problem of sufficient magnitude existed at this time which would warrant such an amendment.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;1998 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to Rule 35(b) is intended to fill a gap in current practice. Under the Sentencing Reform Act and the applicable guidelines, a defendant who has provided &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; assistance to the Government before sentencing may receive a reduced sentence under United States Sentencing Guideline &sect;5K1.1. In addition, a defendant who provides substantial assistance after the sentence has been imposed may receive a reduction of the sentence if the Government files a motion under Rule 35(b). In theory, a defendant who has provided substantial assistance both before and after sentencing could benefit from both &sect;5K1.1 and Rule 35(b). But a defendant who has provided, on the whole, substantial assistance may not be able to benefit from either provision because each provision requires &ldquo;substantial assistance.&rdquo; As one court has noted, those two provisions contain distinct &ldquo;temporal boundaries.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Drown</em>, 942 F.2d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="note-body">Although several decisions suggest that a court may aggregate the defendant's pre-sentencing and post-sentencing assistance in determining whether the &ldquo;substantial assistance&rdquo; requirement of Rule 35(b) has been met, <em>United States v. Speed</em>, 53 F.3d 643, 647&ndash;649 (4th Cir. 1995) (Ellis, J. concurring), there is no formal mechanism for doing so. The amendment to Rule 35(b) is designed to fill that need. Thus, the amendment permits the court to consider, in determining the substantiality of post-sentencing assistance, the defendant's pre-sentencing assistance, irrespective of whether that assistance, standing alone, was substantial.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment, however, is not intended to provide a double benefit to the defendant. Thus, if the defendant has already received a reduction of sentence under U.S.S.G. &sect;5K1.1 for substantial pre-sentencing assistance, he or she may not have that assistance counted again in a post-sentence Rule 35(b) motion.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made After Publication (&ldquo;GAP Report&rdquo;)</em>. The Committee incorporated the Style Subcommittee's suggested changes.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2002 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The language of Rule 35 has been amended as part of the general restyling of the Criminal Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee deleted current Rule 35(a) (Correction on Remand). Congress added that rule, which currently addresses the issue of the district court's actions following a remand on the issue of sentencing, in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Pub. L. No. 98&ndash;473. The rule cross-references 18 U.S.C. &sect;3742, also enacted in 1984, which provides detailed guidance on the various options available to the appellate courts in addressing sentencing errors. In reviewing both provisions, the Committee concluded that Rule 35(a) was no longer needed. First, the statute clearly covers the subject matter and second, it is not necessary to address an issue that would be very clear to a district court following a decision by a court of appeals.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 35(c), which addressed the authority of the court to correct certain errors in the sentence, is now located in Rule 35(a). In the current version of Rule 35(c), the sentencing court is authorized to correct errors in the sentence if the correction is made within seven days of the imposition of the sentence. The revised rule uses the term &ldquo;sentencing.&rdquo; No change in practice is intended by using that term.</p>
<p class="note-body">A substantive change has been made in revised Rule 35(b). Under current Rule 35(b), if the government believes that a sentenced defendant has provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person, it may move the court to reduce the original sentence; ordinarily, the motion must be filed within one year of sentencing. In 1991, the rule was amended to permit the government to file such motions after more than one year had elapsed if the government could <!-- PDFPage:139 -->show that the defendant's substantial assistance involved &ldquo;information or evidence not known by the defendant&rdquo; until more than one year had elapsed. The current rule, however, did not address the question whether a motion to reduce a sentence could be filed and granted in those instances when the defendant's substantial assistance involved information provided by the defendant within one year of sentence but that did not become useful to the government until more than one year after sentencing (e.g., when the government starts an investigation to which the information is pertinent). The courts were split on the issue. <em>Compare United States v. Morales</em>, 52 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 1995) (permitting filing and granting of motion) <em>with United States v. Orozco</em>, 160 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir. 1998) (denying relief and citing cases). Although the court in <em>Orozco</em> felt constrained to deny relief under Rule 35(b), the court urged an amendment of the rule to:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">address the apparent unforeseen situation presented in this case where a convicted defendant provides information to the government prior to the expiration of the jurisdictional, one-year period from sentence imposition, but that information does not become useful to the government until more than one year after sentence imposition. <em>Id</em>. at 1316, n. 13.</p>
<p class="note-body">Nor does the existing rule appear to allow a substantial assistance motion under equally deserving circumstances where a defendant, who fails to provide information within one year of sentencing because its usefulness could not reasonably have been anticipated, later provides the information to the government promptly upon its usefulness becoming apparent.</p>
<p class="note-body">Revised Rule 35(b) is intended to address both of those situations. First, Rule 35(b)(2)(B) makes clear that a sentence reduction motion is permitted in those instances identified by the court in <em>Orozco</em>. Second, Rule 35(b)(2)(C) recognizes that a post-sentence motion is also appropriate in those instances where the defendant did not provide any information within one year of sentencing, because its usefulness was not reasonably apparent to the defendant during that period. But the rule requires that once the defendant realizes the importance of the information the defendant promptly provide the information to the government. What constitutes &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; notification will depend on the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rule's one-year restriction generally serves the important interests of finality and of creating an incentive for defendants to provide promptly what useful information they might have. Thus, the proposed amendment would not eliminate the one-year requirement as a generally operative element. But where the usefulness of the information is not reasonably apparent until a year or more after sentencing, no sound purpose is served by the current rule's removal of any incentive to provide that information to the government one year or more after the sentence (or if previously provided, for the government to seek to reward the defendant) when its relevance and substantiality become evident.</p>
<p class="note-body">By using the term &ldquo;involves&rdquo; in Rule 35(b)(2) in describing the sort of information that may result in substantial assistance, the Committee recognizes that a court does not lose jurisdiction to consider a Rule 35(b)(2) motion simply because other information, not covered by any of the three provisions in Rule 35(b)(2), is presented in the motion.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2004 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 35(c) is a new provision, which defines sentencing for purposes of Rule 35 as the oral announcement of the sentence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Originally, the language in Rule 35 had used the term &ldquo;imposition of sentence.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;imposition of sentence&rdquo; was not defined in the rule and the courts addressing the meaning of the term were split. The majority view was that the term meant the oral announcement of the sentence and the minority view was that it meant the entry of the judgment. <em>See United States v. Aguirre</em>, 214 F.3d 1122, 1124&ndash;25 (9th Cir. 2000) (discussion of original Rule 35(c) and citing cases). During the restyling of all of the Criminal Rules in 2000 and 2001, the Committee determined that the uniform term &ldquo;sentencing&rdquo; throughout the entire rule was the more appropriate term. After further reflection, and with the recognition that some ambiguity may still be present in using the term &ldquo;sentencing,&rdquo; the Committee believes that the better approach is to make clear in the rule itself that the term &ldquo;sentencing&rdquo; in Rule 35 means the oral announcement of the sentence. That is the meaning recognized in the majority of the cases addressing the issue.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Rule 35 After Publication and Comment</em>. The Committee changed the definition of the triggering event for the timing requirements in Rule 35 to conform to the majority view in the circuit courts and adopted a special definitional section, Rule 35(c), to define sentencing as the &ldquo;oral announcement of the sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2007 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Subdivision (b)(1)</em>. The amendment conforms Rule 35(b)(1) to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>United States v. Booker</em>, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). In <em>Booker</em> the Court held that the provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3553(b)(1), violates the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. With this provision severed and excised, the Court held, the Sentencing Reform Act &ldquo;makes the Guidelines effectively advisory,&rdquo; and &ldquo;requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C.A. &sect;3553(a)(4) (Supp. 2004), but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see &sect;3553(a) (Supp. 2004).&rdquo; <em>Id</em>. at 245&ndash;46. Subdivision (b)(1)(B) has been deleted because it treats the guidelines as mandatory.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public Comment</em>. No changes were made to the text of the proposed amendment as released for public comment, but one change was made in the Committee Note. Here&mdash;as in the other <em>Booker</em> rules&mdash;the Committee deleted the reference to the Fifth Amendment from the description of the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Booker</em>.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Committee Notes on Rules&mdash;2009 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Former Rule 35 permitted the correction of arithmetic, technical, or clear errors within 7 days of sentencing. In light of the increased complexity of the sentencing process, the Committee concluded it would be beneficial to expand this period to 14 days, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays as provided by Rule 45(a). Extension of the period in this fashion will cause no jurisdictional problems if an appeal has been filed, because Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(5) expressly provides that the filing of a notice of appeal does not divest the district court of jurisdiction to correct a sentence under Rule 35(a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Amendment by Public Law</h4>
<p class="note-body">1986&mdash;Subd. (b). Pub. L. 99&ndash;570 substituted &ldquo;in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code.

<p class="note-body">This rule substantially continues existing law except that it provides that in case an appeal is taken from a judgment imposing a sentence of imprisonment, a stay shall be granted only if the defendant so elects, or is admitted to bail. Under the present rule the sentence is automatically stayed unless the defendant elects to commence service of the sentence pending appeal. The new rule merely changes the burden of making the election. See Rule V of the Criminal Appeals Rules, 1933, 292 U.S. 661.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A defendant sentenced to a term of imprisonment is committed to the custody of the Attorney General who is empowered by statute to designate the place of his confinement. 18 U.S.C. &sect;4082. The sentencing court has no authority to designate the place of imprisonment. See, e.g., <em>Hogue v. United States</em>, 287 F.2d 99 (5th Cir. 1961), cert. den., 368 U.S. 932 (1961).</p>
<p class="note-body">When the place of imprisonment has been designated, and notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal, the defendant is usually transferred from the place of his temporary detention within the district of his conviction unless he has elected &ldquo;not to commence service of the sentence.&rdquo; This transfer can be avoided only if the defendant makes the election, a course sometimes advised by counsel who may deem it necessary to consult with the defendant from time to time before the appeal is finally perfected. However, the election deprives the defendant of a right to claim credit for the time spent in jail pending the disposition of the appeal because 18 U.S.C. &sect;3568 provides that the sentence of imprisonment commences, to run only from &ldquo;the date on which such person is received at the penitentiary, reformatory, or jail for service of said sentence.&rdquo; See, e.g., <em>Shelton v. United States</em>, 234 F.2d 132 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment eliminates the procedure for election not to commence service of sentence. In lieu thereof it is provided that the court may recommend to the Attorney General that the defendant be retained at or transferred to a place of confinement near the place of trial or the place where the appeal is to be heard for the period reasonably necessary to permit the defendant to assist in the preparation of his appeal to the court of appeals. Under this procedure the defendant would no longer be required to serve dead time in a local jail in order to assist in preparation of his appeal.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 38(a)(2) is amended to reflect rule 9(b), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The criteria for the stay of a sentence of imprisonment pending disposition of an appeal are those specified in rule 9(c) which incorporates 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148 by reference.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subdivision (a)(2) is retained although easy access to the defendant has become less important with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act which provides for compensation to the attorney to travel to the place at which the defendant is confined. Whether the court will recommend confinement near the place of trial or place where the appeal is to be heard will depend upon a balancing of convenience against the possible advantage of confinement at a more remote correctional institution where facilities and program may be more adequate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision (a)(4) gives the court discretion in deciding whether to stay the order placing the defendant on probation. It also makes mandatory the fixing of conditions for the stay if a stay is granted. The court cannot release the defendant pending appeal without either placing him on probation or fixing the conditions for the stay under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148.</p>
<p class="note-body">Former rule 38(a)(4) makes mandatory a stay of an order placing the defendant on probation whenever an appeal is noted. The court may or may not impose conditions upon the stay. See rule 46, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148.</p>
<p class="note-body">Having the defendant on probation during the period of appeal may serve the objectives of both community protection and defendant rehabilitation. In current practice, the order of probation is sometimes stayed for an appeal period as long as two years. In a situation where the appeal is unsuccessful, the defendant must start under probation supervision after so long a time that the conditions of probation imposed at the time of initial sentencing may no longer appropriately relate either to the defendant's need for rehabilitation or to the community's need for protection. The purposes of probation are more likely to be served if the judge can exercise discretion, in appropriate cases, to require the defendant to be under probation during the period of appeal. The American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice takes the position that prompt imposition of sentence aids in the rehabilitation of defendants, ABA Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty &sect;1.8(a)(i), Commentary p. 40 (Approved Draft, 1968). See also Sutherland and Cressey, Principles of Criminology 336 (1966).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148 the court now has discretion to impose conditions of release which are necessary to protect the community against danger from the defendant. This is in contrast to release prior to conviction, where the only appropriate criterion is insuring the appearance of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. &sect;3146. Because the court may impose conditions of release to insure community protection, it seems appropriate to enable the court to do so by ordering the defendant to submit to probation supervision during the period of appeal, thus giving the probation service responsibility for supervision.</p>
<p class="note-body">A major difference between probation and release under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148 exists if the defendant violates the conditions imposed upon his release. In the event that release is under 18 U.S.C. &sect;3148, the violation of the condition may result in his being placed in custody pending the decision on appeal. If the appeal were unsuccessful, the order placing him on probation presumably would become effective at that time, and he would then be released under probation supervision. If the defendant were placed on probation, his violation of a condition could result in the imposition of a jail or prison sentence. If the appeal were unsuccessful, the jail or prison sentence would continue to be served.</p>
