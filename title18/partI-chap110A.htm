<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 3663, and in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty authorized by law, the court shall order restitution for any offense under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Scope and Nature of Order.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Directions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The order of restitution under this section shall direct that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the defendant pay to the victim (through the appropriate court mechanism) the full amount of the victim's losses as determined by the court, pursuant to paragraph (3); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the United States Attorney enforce the restitution order by all available and reasonable means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement by victim</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An order of restitution also may be enforced by a victim named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;full amount of the victim's losses&rdquo; includes any costs incurred by the victim for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) medical services relating to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) necessary transportation, temporary housing, and child care expenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) lost income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) attorneys&rsquo; fees, plus any costs incurred in obtaining a civil protection order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Order mandatory</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) The issuance of a restitution order under this section is mandatory.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:410 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A court may not decline to issue an order under this section because of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the economic circumstances of the defendant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the fact that a victim has, or is entitled to, receive compensation for his or her injuries from the proceeds of insurance or any other source.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the court may take into account the economic circumstances of the defendant in determining the manner in which and the schedule according to which the restitution is to be paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;economic circumstances&rdquo; includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the financial resources and other assets of the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) projected earnings, earning capacity, and other income of the defendant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) any financial obligations of the defendant, including obligations to dependents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Subparagraph (A) does not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the court finds on the record that the economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow for the payment of any amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the payment of any or some portion of the amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future (under any reasonable schedule of payments); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the court enters in its order the amount of the victim's losses, and provides a nominal restitution award.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>More than 1 offender</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the court finds that more than 1 offender has contributed to the loss of a victim, the court may make each offender liable for payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability among the offenders to reflect the level of contribution and economic circumstances of each offender.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>More than 1 victim</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the court finds that more than 1 victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by an offender, the court shall order full restitution of each victim but may provide for different payment schedules to reflect the economic circumstances of each victim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Payment schedule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An order under this section may direct the defendant to make a single lump-sum payment or partial payments at specified intervals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Setoff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any amount paid to a victim under this section shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim from the defendant in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by the law of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Effect on other sources of compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The issuance of a restitution order shall not affect the entitlement of a victim to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source until the payments actually received by the victim under the restitution order fully compensate the victim for the loss.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) <cap-smallcap>Condition of probation or supervised release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Compliance with a restitution order issued under this section shall be a condition of any probation or supervised release of a defendant. If an offender fails to comply with a restitution order, the court may, after a hearing, revoke probation or a term of supervised release, modify the terms or conditions of probation or a term of supervised release, or hold the defendant in contempt pursuant to section 3583(e). In determining whether to revoke probation or a term of supervised release, modify the terms or conditions of probation or supervised release or hold a defendant serving a term of supervised release in contempt, the court shall consider the defendant's employment status, earning ability and financial resources, the willfulness of the defendant's failure to comply, and any other circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant's ability to comply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Affidavit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 60 days after conviction and, in any event, not later than 10 days before sentencing, the United States Attorney (or such Attorney's delegate), after consulting with the victim, shall prepare and file an affidavit with the court listing the amounts subject to restitution under this section. The affidavit shall be signed by the United States Attorney (or the delegate) and the victim. Should the victim object to any of the information included in the affidavit, the United States Attorney (or the delegate) shall advise the victim that the victim may file a separate affidavit and assist the victim in the preparation of the affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Objection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after the defendant has been notified of the affidavit, no objection is raised by the defendant, the amounts attested to in the affidavit filed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be entered in the court's restitution order. If objection is raised, the court may require the victim or the United States Attorney (or the United States Attorney's delegate) to submit further affidavits or other supporting documents, demonstrating the victim's losses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Additional Documentation and Testimony</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court concludes, after reviewing the supporting documentation and considering the defendant's objections, that there is a substantial reason for doubting the authenticity or veracity of the records submitted, the court may require additional documentation or hear testimony on those questions. The privacy of any records filed, or testimony heard, pursuant to this section, shall be maintained to the greatest extent possible, and such records may be filed or testimony heard in camera.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Final Determination of Losses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the victim's losses are not ascertainable 10 days before sentencing as provided in subsection (c), the United States Attorney (or the United States Attorney's delegate) shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If the victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 90 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order. Such order may be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to include such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Restitution in Addition to Punishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An award of restitution to the victim of an of<!-- PDFPage:411 -->fense under this chapter is not a substitute for imposition of punishment under this chapter.</p>
