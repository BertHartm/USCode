<p class="note-body">The section is rewritten to conform to the style of title 18. The words &ldquo;a member or employee of the United States Civil Service Commission&rdquo; are coextensive with and substituted for &ldquo;Civil Service Commissioner, examiner, copyist, or messenger&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The references to actions in concert with others to violate this section are omitted in view of the crime of conspiracy contained in chapter 19 of title 18.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;the rules prescribed by the President under title 5 for the administration of the competitive service and the regulations prescribed by the Commission under section 1302(a) of title 5&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any such rules or regulations&rdquo; to provide the basis of reference.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitive section 1 of this title. (See reviser's note under 18 U.S.C. 212, 1964 ed.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;and upon conviction thereof&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because punishment can be imposed only after conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;or both&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;or by both such fine and imprisonment&rdquo;.</p>
