<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 1597 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties (June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, &sect;597, 46 Stat. 752).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section was rewritten to place the criminal provisions ahead of the forfeiture provisions. This did not require any substantive changes except omission of reference to persons aiding. Such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment prescribed by section 545 of this title was inserted to make this section complete without reference to another section. In doing so it was necessary to rephrase the punishment provision of section 545 of this title, as originally enacted, without change of substance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Forfeiture provision was rephrased to make it clear that forfeiture was not dependent upon conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
