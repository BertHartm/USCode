<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Presentence Study and Report by Bureau of Prisons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court, before or after its receipt of a report specified in subsection (a) or (c), desires more information than is otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the sentence to be imposed on a defendant found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony, it may order a study of the defendant. The study shall be conducted in the local community by qualified consultants unless the sentencing judge finds that there is a compelling reason for the study to be done by the Bureau of Prisons or there are no adequate professional resources available in the local community to perform the study. The period of the study shall be no more than sixty days. The order shall specify the additional information that the court needs before determining the sentence to be imposed. Such an order shall be treated for administrative purposes as a provisional sentence of imprisonment for the maximum term authorized by section 3581(b) for the offense committed. The study shall inquire into such matters as are specified by the court and any other matters that the Bureau of Prisons or the professional consultants believe are pertinent to the factors set forth in section 3553(a). The period of the study may, in the discretion of the court, be extended for an additional period of not more than sixty days. By the expiration of the period of the study, or by the expiration of any extension granted by the court, the United States marshal shall, if the defendant is in custody, return the defendant to the court for final sentencing. The Bureau of Prisons or the professional consultants shall provide the court with a written report of the pertinent results of the study and make to the court whatever recommendations the Bureau or the consultants believe will be helpful to a proper resolution of the case. The report shall include recommendations of the Bureau or the consultants concerning the guidelines and policy statements, promulgated by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a), that they believe are applicable to the defendant's case. After receiving the report and the recommendations, the court shall proceed finally to sentence the defendant in accordance with the sentencing alternatives and procedures available under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Presentence Examination and Report by Psychiatric or Psychological Examiners</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court, before or after its receipt of a report specified in subsection (a) or (b) desires more information than is otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the mental condition of the defendant, the court may order the same psychiatric or psychological examination and report thereon as may be ordered under section 4244(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Presentence Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall assure that a report filed pursuant to this section is disclosed to the defendant, the counsel for the defendant, and the attorney for the Government at least ten days prior to the date set for sentencing, unless this minimum period is waived by the defendant. The court shall provide a copy of the presentence report to the attorney for the Government to use in collecting an assessment, criminal fine, forfeiture or restitution imposed.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Factors To Be Considered in Imposing a Sentence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the need for the sentence imposed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, and that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a)(2) that is in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Application of Guidelines in Imposing a Sentence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4) unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described. In determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken into consideration, the court shall consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission. In the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline, the court shall impose an appropriate sentence, having due regard for the purposes set forth in subsection (a)(2). In the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline in the case of an offense other than a petty offense, the court shall also have due regard for the relationship of the sentence imposed to sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar offenses and offenders, and to the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Reasons for Imposing a Sentence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, at the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence, and, if the sentence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is of the kind, and within the range, described in subsection (a)(4), and that range exceeds 24 months, the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not of the kind, or is outside the range, described in subsection (a)(4), the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:616 --><p class="statutory-body-block">If the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, the court shall include in the statement the reason therefor. The court shall provide a transcription or other appropriate public record of the court's statement of reasons to the Probation System, and, if the sentence includes a term of imprisonment, to the Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Presentence Procedure for an Order of Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Prior to imposing an order of notice pursuant to section 3555, the court shall give notice to the defendant and the Government that it is considering imposing such an order. Upon motion of the defendant or the Government, or on its own motion, the court shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permit the defendant and the Government to submit affidavits and written memoranda addressing matters relevant to the imposition of such an order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) afford counsel an opportunity in open court to address orally the appropriateness of the imposition of such an order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include in its statement of reasons pursuant to subsection (c) specific reasons underlying its determinations regarding the nature of such an order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Upon motion of the defendant or the Government, or on its own motion, the court may in its discretion employ any additional procedures that it concludes will not unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limited Authority To Impose a Sentence Below a Statutory Minimum</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall be imposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimums in Certain Cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of an offense under section 401, 404, or 406 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 844, 846) or section 1010 or 1013 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960, 963), the court shall impose a sentence pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission under section 994 of title 28 without regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds at sentencing, after the Government has been afforded the opportunity to make a recommendation, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</p>
