<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 710a of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping (June 25, 1936, ch. 816, &sect;6, 49 Stat. 1936).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation,&rdquo; identifying the agency issuing the certificate, license or document, was omitted without change of substance. The functions of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were transferred to the Bureau of Customs and the Coast Guard by Executive Order 9083 Feb. 28, 1942, title 50, App. U.S.C., 1940 ed., following &sect;601. Such transfer is temporary under section 621 of title 50, App., U.S.C., 1940 ed. (First War Powers Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">As revised the section is broad enough to embrace certificates, licenses and documents issued by the officers or employees of the Coast Guard and Customs Service, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or abetting was omitted as such persons are principals under section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.</p>
