<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The court on motion of a defendant shall arrest judgment if the indictment or information does not charge an offense or if the court was without jurisdiction of the offense charged. The motion in arrest of judgment shall be made within 7 days after verdict or finding of guilty, or after plea of guilty or <em>nolo contendere</em>, or within such further time as the court may fix during the 7-day period.</p>

<p class="note-body">This rule continues existing law except that it enlarges the time for making motions in arrest of judgment from 3 days to 5 days. See Rule II (2) of Criminal Appeals Rules of 1933, 292 U.S.C. 661.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;on motion of a defendant&rdquo; are added to make clear here, as in Rule 33, that the court may act only pursuant to a timely motion by the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to the second sentence is designed to clarify an ambiguity in the rule as originally drafted. In <em>Lott v. United States</em>, 367 U.S. 421 (1961) the Supreme Court held that when a defendant pleaded nolo contendere the time in which a motion could be made under this rule did not begin to run until entry of the judgment. The Court held that such a plea was not a &ldquo;determination of guilty.&rdquo; No reason of policy appears to justify having the time for making this motion commence with the verdict or finding of guilt but not with the acceptance of the plea of nolo contendere or the plea of guilty. The amendment changes the result in the <em>Lott</em> case and makes the periods uniform. The amendment also changes the time in which the motion may be made to 7 days. See the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 29.</p>
