<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 593 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;22, 38 Stat. 272; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, &sect;5, 40 Stat. 970; Feb. 25, 1927, ch. 191, &sect;15, 44 Stat. 1232; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;326(a), 49 Stat. 715).</p>
<p class="note-body">Other provisions of section 593 of title 12, U.S.C. 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, are incorporated in sections 217 and 218 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;and shall upon conviction thereof&rdquo; were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;bank or banking institution which is a member of the Federal Reserve System or which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;member bank or insured bank&rdquo; to avoid the use of a definitive section based on sections 221a, 264(e)(8), and 588a of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking. Words &ldquo;banks the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;insured banks&rdquo; in second paragraph, for the same reason.</p>
<p class="note-body">Punishment provision harmonized with that of section 656 of this title. (See also, reviser's notes under sections 641 and 645 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in phraseology were also made.</p>
