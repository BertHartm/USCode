The person may be detained pending completion of the hearing. The hearing may be reopened, before or after a determination by the judicial officer, at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Factors To Be Considered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The judicial officer shall, in determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, take into account the available information concerning&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the weight of the evidence against the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the history and characteristics of the person, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, the person was on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under Federal, State, or local law; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person's release. In considering the conditions of release described in subsection (c)(1)(B)(xi) or (c)(1)(B)(xii) of this sec<!-- PDFPage:577 -->tion, the judicial officer may upon his own motion, or shall upon the motion of the Government, conduct an inquiry into the source of the property to be designated for potential forfeiture or offered as collateral to secure a bond, and shall decline to accept the designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Contents of Release Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a release order issued under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the judicial officer shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) include a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the release is subject, in a manner sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the person's conduct; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) advise the person of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the penalties for violating a condition of release, including the penalties for committing an offense while on pretrial release;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consequences of violating a condition of release, including the immediate issuance of a warrant for the person's arrest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sections 1503 of this title (relating to intimidation of witnesses, jurors, and officers of the court), 1510 (relating to obstruction of criminal investigations), 1512 (tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), and 1513 (retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Contents of Detention Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a detention order issued under subsection (e) of this section, the judicial officer shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) include written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) direct that the person be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) direct that the person be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) direct that, on order of a court of the United States or on request of an attorney for the Government, the person in charge of the corrections facility in which the person is confined deliver the person to a United States marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The judicial officer may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person's defense or for another compelling reason.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Presumption of Innocence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Available Sanctions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who has been released under section 3142 of this title, and who has violated a condition of his release, is subject to a revocation of release, an order of detention, and a prosecution for contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocation of Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The attorney for the Government may initiate a proceeding for revocation of an order of release by filing a motion with the district court. A judicial officer may issue a warrant for the arrest of a person charged with violating a condition of release, and the person shall be brought before a judicial officer in the district in which such person's arrest was ordered for a proceeding in accordance with this section. To the extent practicable, a person charged with violating the condition of release that such person not commit a Federal, State, or local crime during the period of release, shall be brought before the judicial officer who ordered the release and whose order is alleged to have been violated. The judicial officer shall enter an order of revocation and detention if, after a hearing, the judicial officer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) finds that there is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) probable cause to believe that the person has committed a Federal, State, or local crime while on release; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) clear and convincing evidence that the person has violated any other condition of release; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) based on the factors set forth in section 3142(g) of this title, there is no condition or combination of conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the person is unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions of release.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If there is probable cause to believe that, while on release, the person committed a Federal, State, or local felony, a rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. If the judicial officer finds that there are conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community, and that the person will abide by such conditions, the judicial officer shall treat the person in accordance with the provisions of section 3142 of this title and may amend the conditions of release accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Prosecution for Contempt</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The judicial officer may commence a prosecution for contempt, under section 401 of this title, if the person has violated a condition of release.</p>
