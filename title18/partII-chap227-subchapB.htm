<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall provide, as an explicit condition of a sentence of probation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction, that the defendant not commit another Federal, State, or local crime during the term of probation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for a felony, that the defendant also abide by at least one condition set forth in subsection (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(13), unless the court finds on the record that extraordinary circumstances exist that would make such a condition plainly unreasonable, in which event the court shall impose one or more of the other conditions set forth under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction, that the defendant not unlawfully possess a controlled substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for a domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b) by a defendant convicted of such an offense for the first time that the defendant attend a public, private, or private nonprofit offender rehabilitation program that has been approved by the court, in consultation with a State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or other appropriate experts, if an approved program is readily available within a 50-mile radius of the legal residence of the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to one drug test within 15 days of release on probation and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled substance, but the condition stated in this paragraph may be ameliorated or suspended by the court for any individual defendant if the defendant's presentence report or other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future substance abuse by the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) that the defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make restitution in accordance with sections 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, 3663A, and 3664; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay the assessment imposed in accordance with section 3013; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that the defendant will notify the court of any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay restitution, fines, or special assessments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the court has imposed and ordered execution of a fine and placed the defendant on probation, payment of the fine or adherence to the court-established installment schedule shall be a condition of the probation. The results of a drug test administered in accordance with paragraph <!-- PDFPage:612 -->(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3563_1_target" name="3563_1">1</a></sup> shall be subject to confirmation only if the results are positive, the defendant is subject to possible imprisonment for such failure, and either the defendant denies the accuracy of such test or there is some other reason to question the results of the test. A defendant who tests positive may be detained pending verification of a positive drug test result. A drug test confirmation shall be a urine drug test confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques or such test as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine to be of equivalent accuracy. The court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or an individual's current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines from the rule of section 3565(b), when considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test administered in accordance with paragraph (4).<sup><a href="#3563_1_target" name="3563_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Discretionary Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may provide, as further conditions of a sentence of probation, to the extent that such conditions are reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2) and to the extent that such conditions involve only such deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in section 3553(a)(2), that the defendant&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) give to the victims of the offense the notice ordered pursuant to the provisions of section 3555;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) work conscientiously at suitable employment or pursue conscientiously a course of study or vocational training that will equip him for suitable employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) refrain, in the case of an individual, from engaging in a specified occupation, business, or profession bearing a reasonably direct relationship to the conduct constituting the offense, or engage in such a specified occupation, business, or profession only to a stated degree or under stated circumstances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) refrain from frequenting specified kinds of places or from associating unnecessarily with specified persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) refrain from excessive use of alcohol, or any use of a narcotic drug or other controlled substance, as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802), without a prescription by a licensed medical practitioner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) undergo available medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, as specified by the court, and remain in a specified institution if required for that purpose;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) reside in a specified place or area, or refrain from residing in a specified place or area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) remain within the jurisdiction of the court, unless granted permission to leave by the court or a probation officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) report to a probation officer as directed by the court or the probation officer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) be ordered deported by a United States district court, or United States magistrate judge, pursuant to a stipulation entered into by the defendant and the United States under section 238(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, except that, in the absence of a stipulation, the United States district court or a United States magistrate judge, may order deportation as a condition of probation, if, after notice and hearing pursuant to such section, the Attorney General demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is deportable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(22) satisfy such other conditions as the court may impose.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Modifications of Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of a sentence of probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the conditions of probation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Written Statement of Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall direct that the probation officer provide the defendant with a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the sentence is subject, and that is sufficiently clear <!-- PDFPage:613 -->and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required.</p>
