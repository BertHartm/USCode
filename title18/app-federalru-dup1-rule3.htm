<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule generally states existing law and practice, 18 U.S.C. 591 [now 3041] (Arrest and removal for trial); <em>United States v. Simon</em> (E.D.Pa.), 248 F. 980; <em>United States v. Maresca</em> (S.D.N.Y.), 266 F. 713, 719&ndash;721. It eliminates, however, the requirement of conformity to State law as to the form and sufficiency of the complaint. See, also, rule 57(b).</p>

<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment deletes the reference to &ldquo;commissioner or other officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the United States&rdquo; and substitute therefor &ldquo;magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The change is editorial in nature to conform the language of the rule to the recently enacted Federal Magistrates Act. The term &ldquo;magistrate&rdquo; is defined in rule 54.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
