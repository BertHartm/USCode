<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body">1. These rules are prescribed under the authority of two acts of Congress, namely: the Act of June 29, 1940, c. 445, 18 U.S.C. 687 [see 3771] (Proceedings in criminal cases prior to and including verdict; power of Supreme Court to prescribe rules), and the Act of November 21, 1941, c. 492, 18 U.S.C. 689 [see 3771, 3772] (Proceedings to punish for criminal contempt of court; application to sections 687 and 688).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The courts of the United States covered by the rules are enumerated in Rule 54(a). In addition to Federal courts in the continental United States they include district courts in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In the Canal Zone only the rules governing proceedings after verdict, finding or plea of guilty are applicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. While the rules apply to proceedings before commissioners when acting as committing magistrates, they do not govern when a commissioner acts as a trial magistrate for the trial of petty offenses committed on Federal reservations. That procedure is governed by rules adopted by order promulgated by the Supreme Court on January 6, 1941 (311 U.S. 733), pursuant to the Act of October 9, 1940, c. 785, secs. 1&ndash;5. See 18 U.S.C. 576&ndash;576d [now 3401, 3402] (relating to trial of petty offenses on Federal reservations by United States commissioners).</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The rule is amended to make clear that the rules are applicable to courts of the United States and, where <!-- PDFPage:17 -->the rule so provides, to proceedings before United States magistrates and state or local judicial officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Primarily these rules are intended to govern proceedings in criminal cases triable in the United States District Court. Special rules have been promulgated, pursuant to the authority set forth in 28 U.S.C. &sect;636(c), for the trial of &ldquo;minor offenses&rdquo; before United States magistrates. (See Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before United States Magistrates (January 27, 1971).)</p>
<p class="note-body">However, there is inevitably some overlap between the two sets of rules. The Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts deal with preliminary, supplementary, and special proceedings which will often be conducted before United States magistrates. This is true, for example, with regard to rule 3&mdash;The Complaint; rule 4&mdash;Arrest Warrant or Summons Upon Complaint; rule 5&mdash;Initial Appearance Before the Magistrate; and rule 5.1&mdash;Preliminary Examination. It is also true, for example, of supplementary and special proceedings such as rule 40&mdash;Commitment to Another District, Removal; rule 41&mdash;Search and Seizure; and rule 46&mdash;Release from Custody. Other of these rules, where applicable, also apply to proceedings before United States magistrates. See Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Minor Offenses Before United States Magistrates, rule 1&mdash;Scope:</p>
<p class="note-body">These rules govern the procedure and practice for the trial of minor offenses (including petty offenses) before United States magistrates under Title 18, U.S.C. &sect;3401, and for appeals in such cases to judges of the district courts. To the extent that pretrial and trial procedure and practice are not specifically covered by these rules, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure apply as to minor offenses other than petty offenses. All other proceedings in criminal matters, other than petty offenses, before United States magistrates are governed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p class="note-body">State and local judicial officers are governed by these rules, but only when the rule specifically so provides. This is the case of rule 3&mdash;The Complaint; rule 4&mdash;Arrest Warrant or Summons Upon Complaint; and rule 5&mdash;Initial Appearance Before the Magistrate. These rules confer authority upon the &ldquo;magistrate,&rdquo; a term which is defined in new rule 54 as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Magistrate&rdquo; includes a United States magistrate as defined in 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;631&ndash;639, a judge of the United States, another judge or judicial officer specifically empowered by statute in force in any territory or possession, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia, to perform a function to which a particular rule relates, and a state or local judicial officer, authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041 to perform the functions prescribed in rules 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p class="note-body">Rule 41 provides that a search warrant may be issued by &ldquo;a judge of a state court of record&rdquo; and thus confers that authority upon appropriate state judicial officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The scope of rules 1 and 54 is discussed in C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;&sect;21, 871&ndash;874 (1969, Supp. 1971), and 8 and 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice chapters 1 and 54 (2d ed. Cipes 1970, Supp. 1971).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment corrects an erroneous cross reference, from Rule 54(c) to Rule 54(a), and replaces the word &ldquo;defined&rdquo; with the more appropriate word &ldquo;provided.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
