<p class="note-body">The criminal provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, sections 703&ndash;711 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation, and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, sections 715&ndash;715r of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation, were considered for inclusion in this chapter. Since these provisions, except parts of sections 704&ndash;707 of said title 16, are so inextricably interwoven with the Migratory Bird Acts, it was found advisable to exclude them.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;145 and &sect;&sect;676, 682, 683, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation (Jan. 24, 1905, ch. 137, &sect;2, 33 Stat. 614; June 29, 1906, ch. 3593, &sect;2, 34 Stat. 607; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, &sect;84, 35 Stat. 1104; Aug. 11, 1916, ch. 313, 39 Stat. 476; June 5, 1920, ch. 247, &sect;2, 41 Stat. 986; Apr. 15, 1924, ch. 108, 43 Stat. 98; Feb. 28, 1925, ch. 376, 43 Stat. 1091; July 3, 1926, ch. 744, &sect;6, 44 Stat. 821; July 3, 1926, ch. 776, &sect;3, 44 Stat. 889; June 28, 1930, ch. 709, &sect;2, 46 Stat. 828; Mar. 10, 1934, ch. 54, &sect;2, 48 Stat. 400; Reorg. Plan No. II, &sect;4(f), 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433).</p>
<p class="note-body">This revised section condenses, consolidates, and simplifies similar provisions of sections 676, 682, 683, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 145 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with such changes of phraseology as make clear the intent of Congress to protect all wildlife within Federal sanctuaries, refuges, fish hatcheries, and breeding grounds. Irrelevant provisions of such sections in title 16 are to be retained in that title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because of the general nature of this consolidated section, no specific reference is made to rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior or any other personage, but only to rules and regulations &ldquo;promulgated by authority of law&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment provided by the sections consolidated varied from a fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or both, in section 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year, or both, in sections 676, 685, and 688 of such title 16. The revised section adopts the punishment provisions of the other five sections.</p>
<p class="note-body">The references to &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; in sections 676, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo; in section 1 of this title, and also to conform with policy followed by codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code, as stated in Senate Report 10, part 1, pages 12, 13, 14, Sixtieth Congress, first session, to accompany S. 2982.</p>

<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;in any United States court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo;, in sections 676, 685, and 688 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., words &ldquo;in any United States court&rdquo;, in sections 689b, 692a, and 694a of such title 16, and words &ldquo;in the discretion of the court&rdquo;, in said sections 676, 685, 688, and 689b, were likewise omitted as surplusage.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The importation into the United States, any territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States, or any shipment between the continental United States, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States, of the mongoose of the species Herpestes auropunctatus; of the species of so-called &ldquo;flying foxes&rdquo; or fruit bats of the genus Pteropus; of the zebra mussel of the species Dreissena polymorpha; of the bighead carp of the species Hypophthalmichthys nobilis; and such other species of wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, reptiles, brown tree snakes, or the offspring or eggs of any of the foregoing which the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe by regulation to be injurious to human beings, to the interests of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or to wildlife or the wildlife resources of the United States, is hereby prohibited. All such prohibited mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, and reptiles, and the eggs or offspring therefrom, shall be promptly exported or destroyed at the expense of the importer or consignee. Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal or modify any provision of the Public Health Service Act or Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Also, this section shall not authorize any action with respect to the importation of any plant pest as defined in the Federal Plant Pest Act,<sup><a href="#42_1_target" name="42_1">1</a></sup> insofar as such importation is subject to regulation under that Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;wild&rdquo; relates to any creatures that, whether or not <!-- PDFPage:25 -->raised in captivity, normally are found in a wild state; and the terms &ldquo;wildlife&rdquo; and &ldquo;wildlife resources&rdquo; include those resources that comprise wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), and all other classes of wild creatures whatsoever, and all types of aquatic and land vegetation upon which such wildlife resources are dependent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of the Interior, when he finds that there has been a proper showing of responsibility and continued protection of the public interest and health, shall permit the importation for zoological, educational, medical, and scientific purposes of any mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibia, and reptiles, or the offspring or eggs thereof, where such importation would be prohibited otherwise by or pursuant to this Act, and this Act shall not restrict importations by Federal agencies for their own use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the importation of dead natural-history specimens for museums or for scientific collections, or the importation of domesticated canaries, parrots (including all other species of psittacine birds), or such other cage birds as the Secretary of the Interior may designate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior shall enforce the provisions of this subsection, including any regulations issued hereunder, and, if requested by the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Treasury may require the furnishing of an appropriate bond when desirable to insure compliance with such provisions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whoever violates this section, or any regulation issued pursuant thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of the Interior within one hundred and eighty days of the enactment of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 shall prescribe such requirements and issue such permits as he may deem necessary for the transportation of wild animals and birds under humane and healthful conditions, and it shall be unlawful for any person, including any importer, knowingly to cause or permit any wild animal or bird to be transported to the United States, or any Territory or district thereof, under inhumane or unhealthful conditions or in violation of such requirements. In any criminal prosecution for violation of this subsection and in any administrative proceeding for the suspension of the issuance of further permits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the condition of any vessel or conveyance, or the enclosures in which wild animals or birds are confined therein, upon its arrival in the United States, or any Territory or district thereof, shall constitute relevant evidence in determining whether the provisions of this subsection have been violated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the presence in such vessel or conveyance at such time of a substantial ratio of dead, crippled, diseased, or starving wild animals or birds shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the violation of the provisions of this subsection.</p>

<p class="note-body">The amount of the fine was reduced from $1,000 to $500, thus making the violation a petty offense as defined in section 1 of this title. (See also section 41 of this title which provides a similar punishment.)</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) There are certain extreme acts of animal cruelty that appeal to a specific sexual fetish. These acts of extreme animal cruelty are videotaped, and the resulting video tapes are commonly referred to as &lsquo;animal crush videos&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Supreme Court of the United States has long held that obscenity is an exception to speech protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In the judgment of Congress, many animal crush videos are obscene in the sense that the depictions, taken as a whole&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) appeal to the prurient interest in sex;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) are patently offensive; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Serious criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty are integral to the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos is intrinsically related and integral to creating an incentive for, directly causing, and perpetuating demand for the serious acts of extreme animal cruelty the videos depict. The primary reason for those criminal acts is the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of the animal crush video image.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The serious acts of extreme animal cruelty necessary to make animal crush videos are committed in a clandestine manner that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) allows the perpetrators of such crimes to remain anonymous;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) makes it extraordinarily difficult to establish the jurisdiction within which the underlying criminal acts of extreme animal cruelty occurred; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) often precludes proof that the criminal acts occurred within the statute of limitations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Each of the difficulties described in paragraph (9) seriously frustrates and impedes the ability of State authorities to enforce the criminal statutes prohibiting such behavior.&rdquo;</p>
