<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2704. Backup preservation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Backup Preservation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A governmental entity acting under section 2703(b)(2) may include in its subpoena or court order a requirement that the service provider to whom the request is directed create a backup copy of the contents of the electronic communications sought in order to preserve those communications. Without notifying the subscriber or customer of such subpoena or court order, such service provider shall create such backup copy as soon as practicable consistent with its regular business practices and shall confirm to the governmental entity that such backup copy has been made. Such backup copy shall be created within two business days after receipt by the service provider of the subpoena or court order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall be made by the governmental entity within three days after receipt of such confirmation, unless such notice is delayed pursuant to section 2705(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The service provider shall not destroy such backup copy until the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the delivery of the information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the resolution of any proceedings (including appeals of any proceeding) concerning the government's subpoena or court order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The service provider shall release such backup copy to the requesting governmental entity no sooner than fourteen days after the governmental entity's notice to the subscriber or customer if such service provider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has not received notice from the subscriber or customer that the subscriber or customer has challenged the governmental entity's request; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has not initiated proceedings to challenge the request of the governmental entity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A governmental entity may seek to require the creation of a backup copy under subsection (a)(1) of this section if in its sole discretion such entity determines that there is reason to believe that notification under section 2703 of this title of the existence of the subpoena or court order may result in destruction of or tampering with evidence. This determination is not subject to challenge by the subscriber or customer or service provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Customer Challenges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Within fourteen days after notice by the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer under subsection (a)(2) of this section, such subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash such subpoena or vacate such court order, with copies served upon the governmental entity and with written notice of such challenge to the service provider. A motion to vacate a court order shall be filed in the court which issued such order. A motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed in the appropriate United States district court or State court. Such motion or application shall contain an affidavit or sworn statement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) stating that the applicant is a customer or subscriber to the service from which the contents of electronic communications maintained for him have been sought; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) stating the applicant's reasons for believing that the records sought are not relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this chapter in some other respect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Service shall be made under this section upon a governmental entity by delivering or mailing by registered or certified mail a copy of the papers to the person, office, or department specified in the notice which the customer has received pursuant to this chapter. For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the court finds that the customer has complied with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the court shall order the governmental entity to file a sworn response, which may be filed in camera if the governmental entity includes in its response the reasons which make in camera review appropriate. If the court is unable to determine the motion or application on the basis of the parties&rsquo; initial allegations and response, the court may conduct such additional proceedings as it deems appropriate. All such proceedings shall be completed and the motion or application decided as soon as practicable after the filing of the governmental entity's response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are maintained, or that there is a reason to believe that the law enforcement inquiry is legitimate and that the communications sought are relevant to that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and order such process enforced. If the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are maintained, and that there is not a reason to believe that the communications sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry, or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this chapter, it shall order the process quashed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A court order denying a motion or application under this section shall not be deemed a final order and no interlocutory appeal may be taken therefrom by the customer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; means any renter, purchaser, or subscriber of goods or services from a video tape service provider;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;ordinary course of business&rdquo; means only debt collection activities, order fulfillment, request processing, and the transfer of ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;personally identifiable information&rdquo; includes information which identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials or services from a video tape service provider; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the term &ldquo;video tape service provider&rdquo; means any person, engaged in the business, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, of rental, sale, or delivery of prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials, or any person or other entity to whom a disclosure is made under subparagraph (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(2), but only with respect to the information contained in the disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Video Tape Rental and Sale Records</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A video tape service provider who knowingly discloses, to any person, personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider shall be liable to the aggrieved person for the relief provided in subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A video tape service provider may disclose personally identifiable information concerning any consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to any person with the informed, written consent of the consumer given at the time the disclosure is sought;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to a law enforcement agency pursuant to a warrant issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an equivalent State warrant, a grand jury subpoena, or a court order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to any person if the disclosure is solely of the names and addresses of consumers and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the video tape service provider has provided the consumer with the opportunity, in a clear and conspicuous manner, to prohibit such disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the disclosure does not identify the title, description, or subject matter of any video tapes or other audio visual material; however, the subject matter of such materials may be disclosed if the disclosure is for the exclusive use of marketing goods and services directly to the consumer;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:596 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) to any person if the disclosure is incident to the ordinary course of business of the video tape service provider; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) pursuant to a court order, in a civil proceeding upon a showing of compelling need for the information that cannot be accommodated by any other means, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Court orders authorizing disclosure under subparagraph (C) shall issue only with prior notice to the consumer and only if the law enforcement agency shows that there is probable cause to believe that the records or other information sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. In the case of a State government authority, such a court order shall not issue if prohibited by the law of such State. A court issuing an order pursuant to this section, on a motion made promptly by the video tape service provider, may quash or modify such order if the information or records requested are unreasonably voluminous in nature or if compliance with such order otherwise would cause an unreasonable burden on such provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Civil Action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Any person aggrieved by any act of a person in violation of this section may bring a civil action in a United States district court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such other preliminary and equitable relief as the court determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No action may be brought under this subsection unless such action is begun within 2 years from the date of the act complained of or the date of discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No liability shall result from lawful disclosure permitted by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Personally Identifiable Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Personally identifiable information obtained in any manner other than as provided in this section shall not be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, arbitration, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Destruction of Old Records</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person subject to this section shall destroy personally identifiable information as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the date the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and there are no pending requests or orders for access to such information under subsection (b)(2) or (c)(2) or pursuant to a court order.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2712. Civil actions against the United States</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any person who is aggrieved by any willful violation of this chapter or of chapter 119 of this title or of sections 106(a), <!-- PDFPage:597 -->305(a), or 405(a) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) may commence an action in United States District Court against the United States to recover money damages. In any such action, if a person who is aggrieved successfully establishes such a violation of this chapter or of chapter 119 of this title or of the above specific provisions of title 50, the Court may assess as damages&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) actual damages, but not less than $10,000, whichever amount is greater; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) litigation costs, reasonably incurred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Any action against the United States under this section may be commenced only after a claim is presented to the appropriate department or agency under the procedures of the Federal Tort Claims Act, as set forth in title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any action against the United States under this section shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within 2 years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within 6 months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented. The claim shall accrue on the date upon which the claimant first has a reasonable opportunity to discover the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any action under this section shall be tried to the court without a jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the procedures set forth in section 106(f), 305(g), or 405(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) shall be the exclusive means by which materials governed by those sections may be reviewed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An amount equal to any award against the United States under this section shall be reimbursed by the department or agency concerned to the fund described in section 1304 of title 31, United States Code, out of any appropriation, fund, or other account (excluding any part of such appropriation, fund, or account that is available for the enforcement of any Federal law) that is available for the operating expenses of the department or agency concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Administrative Discipline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a court or appropriate department or agency determines that the United States or any of its departments or agencies has violated any provision of this chapter, and the court or appropriate department or agency finds that the circumstances surrounding the violation raise serious questions about whether or not an officer or employee of the United States acted willfully or intentionally with respect to the violation, the department or agency shall, upon receipt of a true and correct copy of the decision and findings of the court or appropriate department or agency promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action against the officer or employee is warranted. If the head of the department or agency involved determines that disciplinary action is not warranted, he or she shall notify the Inspector General with jurisdiction over the department or agency concerned and shall provide the Inspector General with the reasons for such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exclusive Remedy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any action against the United States under this subsection shall be the exclusive remedy against the United States for any claims within the purview of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Stay of Proceedings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Upon the motion of the United States, the court shall stay any action commenced under this section if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the Government to conduct a related investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case. Such a stay shall toll the limitations periods of paragraph (2) of subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the terms &ldquo;related criminal case&rdquo; and &ldquo;related investigation&rdquo; mean an actual prosecution or investigation in progress at the time at which the request for the stay or any subsequent motion to lift the stay is made. In determining whether an investigation or a criminal case is related to an action commenced under this section, the court shall consider the degree of similarity between the parties, witnesses, facts, and circumstances involved in the 2 proceedings, without requiring that any one or more factors be identical.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In requesting a stay under paragraph (1), the Government may, in appropriate cases, submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect a related investigation or a related criminal case. If the Government makes such an ex parte submission, the plaintiff shall be given an opportunity to make a submission to the court, not ex parte, and the court may, in its discretion, request further information from either party.</p>
