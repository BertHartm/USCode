<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) uses an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or State statute or a Federal or State grand jury or trial subpoena; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) obtains a court order for such disclosure under subsection (d) of this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that delayed notice may be given pursuant to section 2705 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on behalf of, and received by means of electronic transmission from (or created by means of computer processing of communications received by means of electronic transmission from), a subscriber or customer of such remote computing service; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service shall disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service (not including the contents of communications covered by subsection (a) or (b) of this section) to a governmental entity only when the governmental entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) obtains a warrant issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent State warrant;</p>

In the case of a State governmental authority, such a court order shall not issue if prohibited by the law of such State. A court issuing an order pursuant to this section, on a motion made promptly by the service provider, may quash or modify such order, if the information or records requested are unusually voluminous in nature or compliance with such order otherwise would cause an undue burden on such provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>No Cause of Action Against a Provider Disclosing Information Under This Chapter</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No cause of action shall lie in any court against any provider of wire or electronic communication service, its officers, employees, agents, or other specified persons for providing information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with the terms of a court order, warrant, subpoena, or certification under this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2704. Backup preservation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Backup Preservation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A governmental entity acting under section 2703(b)(2) may include in its subpoena or court order a requirement that the service provider to whom the request is directed create a backup copy of the contents of the electronic communications sought in order to preserve those communications. Without notifying the subscriber or customer of such subpoena or court order, such service provider shall create such backup copy as soon as practicable consistent with its regular business practices and shall confirm to the governmental entity that such backup copy has been made. Such backup copy shall be created within two business days after receipt by the service provider of the subpoena or court order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall be made by the governmental entity within three days after receipt of such confirmation, unless such notice is delayed pursuant to section 2705(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The service provider shall not destroy such backup copy until the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the delivery of the information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the resolution of any proceedings (including appeals of any proceeding) concerning the government's subpoena or court order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The service provider shall release such backup copy to the requesting governmental entity no sooner than fourteen days after the governmental entity's notice to the subscriber or customer if such service provider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has not received notice from the subscriber or customer that the subscriber or customer has challenged the governmental entity's request; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has not initiated proceedings to challenge the request of the governmental entity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A governmental entity may seek to require the creation of a backup copy under subsection (a)(1) of this section if in its sole discretion such entity determines that there is reason to believe that notification under section 2703 of this title of the existence of the subpoena or court order may result in destruction of or tampering with evidence. This determination is not subject to challenge by the subscriber or customer or service provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Customer Challenges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Within fourteen days after notice by the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer under subsection (a)(2) of this section, such subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash such subpoena or vacate such court order, with copies served upon the governmental entity and with written notice of such challenge to the service provider. A motion to vacate a court order shall be filed in the court which issued such order. A motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed in the appropriate United States district court or State court. Such motion or application shall contain an affidavit or sworn statement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) stating that the applicant is a customer or subscriber to the service from which the contents of electronic communications maintained for him have been sought; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) stating the applicant's reasons for believing that the records sought are not relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this chapter in some other respect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Service shall be made under this section upon a governmental entity by delivering or mailing by registered or certified mail a copy of the papers to the person, office, or department specified in the notice which the customer has received pursuant to this chapter. For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the court finds that the customer has complied with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the court shall order the governmental entity to file a sworn response, which may be filed in camera if the governmental entity includes in its response the reasons which make in camera review appropriate. If the court is unable to determine the motion or application on the basis of the parties&rsquo; initial allegations and response, the court may conduct such additional proceedings as it deems appropriate. All such proceedings shall be completed and the motion or application decided as soon as practicable <!-- PDFPage:504 -->after the filing of the governmental entity's response.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are maintained, or that there is a reason to believe that the law enforcement inquiry is legitimate and that the communications sought are relevant to that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and order such process enforced. If the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are maintained, and that there is not a reason to believe that the communications sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry, or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this chapter, it shall order the process quashed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A court order denying a motion or application under this section shall not be deemed a final order and no interlocutory appeal may be taken therefrom by the customer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;ordinary course of business&rdquo; means only debt collection activities, order fulfillment, request processing, and the transfer of ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;personally identifiable information&rdquo; includes information which identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials or services from a video tape service provider; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the term &ldquo;video tape service provider&rdquo; means any person, engaged in the business, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, of rental, sale, or delivery of prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials, or any person or other entity to whom a disclosure is made under subparagraph (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(2), but only with respect to the information contained in the disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Video Tape Rental and Sale Records</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A video tape service provider who knowingly discloses, to any person, personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider shall be liable to the aggrieved person for the relief provided in subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A video tape service provider may disclose personally identifiable information concerning any consumer&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:507 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to any person with the informed, written consent of the consumer given at the time the disclosure is sought;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to a law enforcement agency pursuant to a warrant issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an equivalent State warrant, a grand jury subpoena, or a court order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to any person if the disclosure is solely of the names and addresses of consumers and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the video tape service provider has provided the consumer with the opportunity, in a clear and conspicuous manner, to prohibit such disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the disclosure does not identify the title, description, or subject matter of any video tapes or other audio visual material; however, the subject matter of such materials may be disclosed if the disclosure is for the exclusive use of marketing goods and services directly to the consumer;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) to any person if the disclosure is incident to the ordinary course of business of the video tape service provider; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Court orders authorizing disclosure under subparagraph (C) shall issue only with prior notice to the consumer and only if the law enforcement agency shows that there is probable cause to believe that the records or other information sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. In the case of a State government authority, such a court order shall not issue if prohibited by the law of such State. A court issuing an order pursuant to this section, on a motion made promptly by the video tape service provider, may quash or modify such order if the information or records requested are unreasonably voluminous in nature or if compliance with such order otherwise would cause an unreasonable burden on such provider.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such other preliminary and equitable relief as the court determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(4) No liability shall result from lawful disclosure permitted by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Personally Identifiable Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Personally identifiable information obtained in any manner other than as provided in this section shall not be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, arbitration, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Destruction of Old Records</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person subject to this section shall destroy personally identifiable information as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the date the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and there are no pending requests or orders for access to such information under subsection (b)(2) or (c)(2) or pursuant to a court order.</p>
