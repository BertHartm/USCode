<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">1948 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on sections 1026(a) and 1514(a) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, sections 596, 981, 1122, 1123, 1138d(a), 1248, 1312, 1313, 1441(a), and 1467(a), of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(a) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;22(h), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, &sect;3, 48 Stat. 1107; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;31, first paragraph, 39 Stat. 382; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;211(b), (c), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, &sect;2, 42 Stat. 1460; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, &sect;&sect;209(h), 216(b), (c), 42 Stat. 1468, 1472; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, &sect;16 (a), 47 Stat. 11; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, &sect;21(a), 47 Stat. 738; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, &sect;8(a), 48 Stat. 134; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, &sect;64(a), 48 Stat. 267; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, &sect;13, 48 Stat. 347; June 3, 1935, ch. 164, &sect;21, 49 Stat. 319; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, &sect;52(a); 50 Stat. 531; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, &sect;514(a), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, &sect;3, 60 Stat. 1064).</p>
<p class="note-body">Each of the 13 sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions either relating to false representations and statements, or overvaluation of security, with respect to one or more of the named banks, agencies, or corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">These were consolidated and the false statement and security overvaluation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The provisions of section 981 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to acceptance of loans or gratuities by examiners, were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 218 [now section 213] of this title. The provisions of said section 981 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, prohibiting land bank and national farm loan association examiners from performing &ldquo;any other service for compensation for any bank or banking or loan association, or for any person connected therewith in any capacity&rdquo; were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 1909 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Eight of the consolidated sections contained identical punishment, each providing for a maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years. Two sections provided for a maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years. One section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years, one section provided for maximum fine of $2,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years, and one section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 1 year.</p>
<p class="note-body">The punishment by maximum fine of $5,000 or maximum imprisonment of 2 years, or both, provided in this consolidated section was adopted as most consistent with the greater number of comparable sections. (See sections 1008 and 1010 of this title.) This is a reasonable reconciliation of the conflicting punishment provisions and adequate for the offenses described.</p>
<p class="note-body">The enumeration of &ldquo;application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement, commitment, or loan&rdquo; and the wording &ldquo;or any change or extension of any of the same, by renewal, deferment of action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of security therefor&rdquo; does not occur in any one of the original sections, but such enumeration and such wording are adequate, and they represent a composite of terms and transactions mentioned in each.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, changes were made in phraseology to secure uniformity of style, and some rephrasing was necessary, but the consolidation was without change of substance except as above indicated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1138d(f) of Title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to conspiracy, was not added to this consolidated section for reasons given in reviser's note under section 493 of this title.</p>
