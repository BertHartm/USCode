<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Use of Indictment or Information</cap-smallcap>. An offense which may be punished by death shall be prosecuted by indictment. An offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or at hard labor shall be prosecuted by indictment or, if indictment is waived, it may be prosecuted by information. Any other offense may be prosecuted by indictment or by information. An information may be filed without leave of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Indictment</cap-smallcap>. An offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or at hard labor may be prosecuted by information if the defendant, after having been advised of the nature of the charge and of the rights of the defendant, waives in open court prosecution by indictment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Nature and Contents.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General</em>. The indictment or the information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall be signed by the attorney for the government. It need not contain a formal commencement, a formal conclusion or any other matter not necessary to such statement. Allegations made in one count may be incorporated by reference in another count. It may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more specified means. The indictment or information shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Criminal Forfeiture</em>. No judgment of forfeiture may be entered in a criminal proceeding unless the indictment or the information shall allege the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Harmless Error</em>. Error in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or information or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to the defendant's prejudice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Surplusage</cap-smallcap>. The court on motion of the defendant may strike surplusage from the indictment or information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Amendment of Information</cap-smallcap>. The court may permit an information to be amended at any time before verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and if substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Bill of Particulars</cap-smallcap>. The court may direct the filing of a bill of particulars. A motion for a bill of particulars may be made before arraignment or within ten days after arraignment or at such later time as the court may permit. A bill of particulars may be amended at any time subject to such conditions as justice requires.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. This rule gives effect to the following provision of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States: &ldquo;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo;. An infamous crime has been defined as a crime punishable by death or by imprisonment in a penitentiary or at hard labor, <em>Ex parte Wilson</em>, 114 U.S. 417, 427; <em>United States v. Moreland</em>, 258 U.S. 433. Any sentence of imprisonment for a term of over one year may be served in a penitentiary, if so directed by the Attorney General, 18 U.S.C. 753f [now 4082, 4083] (Commitment of persons by any court of the United States and the juvenile court of the District of Columbia; place of confinement; transfers). Consequently any offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of over one year is an infamous crime.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Petty offenses and misdemeanors for which no infamous punishment is prescribed may now be prosecuted by information, 18 U.S.C. 541 [see 1] (Felonies and misdemeanors); <em>Duke v. United States</em>, 301 U.S. 492.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. For a discussion of the provision for waiver of indictment, see Note to Rule 7(b), <em>infra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">4. Presentment is not included as an additional type of formal accusation, since presentments as a method of instituting prosecutions are obsolete, at least as concerns the Federal courts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). 1. Opportunity to waive indictment and to consent to prosecution by information will be a substantial aid to defendants, especially those who, because of inability to give bail, are incarcerated pending action of the grand jury, but desire to plead guilty. This rule is particularly important in those districts in which considerable intervals occur between sessions of the grand jury. In many districts where the grand jury meets infrequently a defendant unable to give bail and desiring to plead guilty is compelled to spend many days, and sometimes many weeks, and <!-- PDFPage:35 -->even months, in jail before he can begin the service of his sentence, whatever it may be, awaiting the action of a grand jury. Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 654&ndash;655; Vanderbilt, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 376, 377; Robinson, 27 Jour. of the Am. Judicature Soc. 38, 45; Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 3. The rule contains safeguards against improvident waivers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, in September 1941, recommended that &ldquo;existing law or established procedure be so changed, that a defendant may waive indictment and plead guilty to an information filed by a United States attorney in all cases except capital felonies.&rdquo; <em>Report of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges</em> (1941) 13. In September 1942 the Judicial Conference recommended that provision be made &ldquo;for waiver of indictment and jury trial, so that persons accused of crime may not be held in jail needlessly pending trial.&rdquo; <em>Id</em>. (1942) 8.</p>
<p class="note-body">Attorneys General of the United States have from time to time recommended legislation to permit defendants to waive indictment and to consent to prosecution by information. See <em>Annual Report of the Attorney General of the United States</em> (Mitchell) (1931) 3; <em>Id</em>. (Mitchell) (1932) 6; <em>Id</em>. (Cummings) (1933) 1, (1936) 2, (1937) 11, (1938) 9; <em>Id</em>. (Murphy) (1939) 7.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act [now 18 U.S.C. 5031&ndash;5037], now permits a juvenile charged with an offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment to consent to prosecution by information on a charge of juvenile delinquency, 18 U.S.C. 922 [now 5032, 5033].</p>
<p class="note-body">2. On the constitutionality of this rule, see <em>United States v. Gill</em>, 55 F.2d 399 (D.N.M.), holding that the constitutional guaranty of indictment by grand jury may be waived by defendant. It has also been held that other constitutional guaranties may be waived by the defendant, e. g., <em>Patton v. United States</em>, 281 U.S. 276 (trial by jury); <em>Johnson v. Zerbst</em>, 304 U.S. 458, 465 (right of counsel); <em>Trono v. United States</em>, 199 U.S. 521, 534 (protection against double jeopardy); <em>United States v. Murdock</em>, 284 U.S. 141, 148 (privilege against self-incrimination); <em>Diaz v. United States</em>, 223 U.S. 442, 450 (right of confrontation).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). 1. This rule introduces a simple form of indictment, illustrated by Forms 1 to 11 in the Appendix of Forms. Cf. Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. For discussion of the effect of this rule and a comparison between the present form of indictment and the simple form introduced by this rule, see Vanderbilt, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 376, 377; Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 654, 655; Holtzoff, 3 F.R.D. 445, 448&ndash;449; Holtzoff, 12 Geo. Washington L.R. 119, 123&ndash;126; Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 3.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The provision contained in the fifth sentence that it may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown, or that he committed it by one or more specified means, is intended to eliminate the use of multiple counts for the purpose of alleging the commission of the offense by different means or in different ways. Cf. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 8(e)(2) [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The law at present regards citations to statutes or regulations as not a part of the indictment. A conviction may be sustained on the basis of a statute or regulation other than that cited. <em>Williams v. United States</em>, 168 U.S. 382, 389; <em>United States v. Hutcheson</em>, 312 U.S. 219, 229. The provision of the rule, in view of the many statutes and regulations, is for the benefit of the defendant and is not intended to cause a dismissal of the indictment, but simply to provide a means by which he can be properly informed without danger to the prosecution.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This rule introduces a means of protecting the defendant against immaterial or irrelevant allegations in an indictment or information, which may, however, be prejudicial. The authority of the court to strike such surplusage is to be limited to doing so on defendant's motion, in the light of the rule that the guaranty of indictment by a grand jury implies that an indictment may not be amended, <em>Ex parte Bain</em>, 121 U.S. 1. By making such a motion, the defendant would, however, waive his rights in this respect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). This rule continues the existing law that, unlike an indictment, an information may be amended, <em>Muncy v. United States</em>, 289 F. 780 (C.C.A. 4th).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law on bills of particulars.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-start:amendment-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to the first sentence eliminating the requirement of a showing of cause is designed to encourage a more liberal attitude by the courts toward bills of particulars without taking away the discretion which courts must have in dealing with such motions in individual cases. For an illustration of wise use of this discretion see the opinion by Justice Whittaker written when he was a district judge in <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 16 F.R.D. 372 (W.D.Mo. 1954).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to the second sentence gives discretion to the court to permit late filing of motions for bills of particulars in meritorious cases. Use of late motions for the purpose of delaying trial should not, of course, be permitted. The courts have not been agreed as to their power to accept late motions in the absence of a local rule or a previous order. See <em>United States v. Miller</em>, 217 F.Supp. 760 (E.D.Pa. 1963); <em>United States v. Taylor</em>, 25 F.R.D. 225 (E.D.N.Y. 1960); <em>United States v. Sterling</em>, 122 F.Supp. 81 (E.D.Pa. 1954) (all taking a limited view of the power of the court). But cf. <em>United States v. Brown</em>, 179 F.Supp. 893 (E.D.N.Y. 1959) (exercising discretion to permit an out of time motion).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(2) is new. It is intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title IX, &sect;1963, and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II, &sect;408(a)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The Congress viewed the provisions of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 as reestablishing a limited common law criminal forfeiture. S. Rep. No. 91&ndash;617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 79&ndash;80 (1969). The legislative history of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 indicates a congressional purpose to have similar procedures apply to the forfeiture of profits or interests under that act. H. Rep. No. 91&ndash;1444 (part I), 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 81&ndash;85 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the common law, in a criminal forfeiture proceeding the defendant was apparently entitled to notice, trial, and a special jury finding on the factual issues surrounding the declaration of forfeiture which followed his criminal conviction. Subdivision (c)(2) provides for notice. Changes in rules 31 and 32 provide for a special jury finding and for a judgment authorizing the Attorney General to seize the interest or property forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to rule 7(c)(2) is intended to clarify its meaning. Subdivision (c)(2) was added in 1972, and, as noted in the Advisory Committee Note thereto, was &ldquo;intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title IX, &sect;1963, and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II, &sect;408(a)(2).&rdquo; These provisions reestablished a limited common law criminal forfeiture, necessitating the addition of subdivision (c)(2) and corresponding changes in rules 31 and 32, for at common law the defendant in a criminal forfeiture proceeding was entitled to notice, trial, and a special jury finding on the factual issues surrounding the declaration of forfeiture which followed his criminal conviction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:36 --><p class="note-body">Although there is some doubt as to what forfeitures should be characterized as &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;remedial,&rdquo; see Note, 62 Cornell L.Rev. 768 (1977), subdivision (c)(2) is intended to apply to those forfeitures which are criminal in the sense that they result from a special verdict under rule 31(e) and a judgment under rule 32(b)(2), and not to those resulting from a separate in rem proceeding. Because some confusion in this regard has resulted from the present wording of subdivision (c)(2), <em>United States v. Hall</em>, 521 F.2d 406 (9th Cir. 1975), a clarifying amendment is in order.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
