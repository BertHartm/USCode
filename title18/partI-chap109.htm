<p class="note-body">Section consolidates section 628 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the portion of section 121 of said title relating to resistance of persons authorized to make searches.</p>
<p class="note-body">Punishment provided by section 121 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was $2,000 fine and imprisonment for 1 year. Section 628 of said title was part of Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title XIII, &sect;1, 40 Stat. 231, prescribing fine of not more than $1,000 and imprisonment not exceeding 2 years for resisting service, execution of search warrant, or assaulting an officer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 253 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., enumerated United States marshals, deputies, and assistants, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, and numerous other officers, the killing of whom is denounced as a Federal offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 254 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., denounced the assaulting of such officers and prescribed punishment therefor without regard to nature of duties involved or performed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In other words sections 253 and 254 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were not limited to officers executing search warrants.</p>
<p class="note-body">Officers enumerated in section 253 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were substantially all those who serve or execute search warrants. Therefore, the language and punishment under section 254 of said title constitute basis of this revised section. No change in legislative intent is involved, as the amendments of sections 253 and 254 of said title are the latest enactments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of section 121 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to rescue of property from seizing officer or its destruction to prevent seizure, are incorporated in sections 2232 and 2233 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Said section 121 of present title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for punishment by fine of not more than $2,000 or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both, of persons rescuing, attempting to rescue, or causing to be rescued, &ldquo;any property&rdquo; which has been seized by &ldquo;any person&rdquo; authorized to make searches and seizures.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;53a (Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 740, &sect;201, 49 Stat. 877).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;or any department or agency thereof&rdquo; were inserted to avoid ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive section 6 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception in the case of an invitation or the consent of the occupant, was inserted to make the section complete and remove any doubt as to the application of this section to searches which have uniformly been upheld.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to misdemeanor was omitted in view of definitive section 1 of this title. (See reviser's note under section 212 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof shall be&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage, since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
