<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) (Oct. 29, 1919, ch. 89, &sect;2(b), 41 Stat. 325; June 22, 1932, ch. 271, &sect;2, 47 Stat. 326; May 18, 1934, ch. 301, 48 Stat. 782; May 22, 1934, ch. 333, &sect;2(a), 48 Stat. 794; Aug. 18, 1941, ch. 366, &sect;2(b), 55 Stat. 631).</p>
<p class="note-body">This section consolidates into one section identical definitions contained in sections 408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to slight improvements in style, the word &ldquo;commerce&rdquo; was substituted for &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; in order to avoid the narrower connotation of the word &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; since &ldquo;commerce&rdquo; obviously includes more than &ldquo;transportation.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;Possession&rdquo; was inserted in two places to make the definition more accurate and comprehensive since the places included in the word &ldquo;Possession&rdquo; would normally be within the term defined and a narrower construction should be handled by express statutory exclusion in those crimes which Congress intends to restrict to commerce within the continental United States.</p>
