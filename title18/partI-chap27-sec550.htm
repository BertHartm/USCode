<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 1590 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties (June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, &sect;590, 46 Stat. 750).</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to felony, contained in words &ldquo;such person shall be guilty of a felony&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of felony in section 1 of this title. This, too, was the policy adopted by the codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code. (See S. Rept. 10, pt. I, pp. 12, 13, and 14, 60th Cong., 1st sess.)</p>
<!-- PDFPage:124 --><p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;and upon conviction thereof&rdquo; before &ldquo;shall be punished&rdquo; were also omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>
