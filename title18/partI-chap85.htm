<p class="note-body">Reference to persons aiding, causing or assisting was omitted. Such persons are principals under section 2 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) was rewritten to eliminate ambiguity and uncertainty by expressly making the exceptive language apply to the entire chapter and by permitting State institutions to manufacture goods for the Federal Government and the District of Columbia and vice versa. In such subsections, the words &ldquo;penal and correctional&rdquo; and &ldquo;penal or correctional,&rdquo; preceding &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; and &ldquo;institution,&rdquo; respectively, were omitted as surplusage.</p>
