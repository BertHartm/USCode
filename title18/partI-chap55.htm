<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;&sect;408a, 408c (June 22, 1932, ch. 271, &sect;&sect;1, 3, 47 Stat. 326; May 18, 1934, ch. 301, 48 Stat. 781, 782).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates sections 408a and 408c of title 18 U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference to persons aiding, abetting or causing was omitted as unnecessary because such persons are made principals by section 22 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;upon conviction&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Direction as to confinement &ldquo;in the penitentiary&rdquo; was omitted because of section 4082 of this title which commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &ldquo;for any term of years or for life&rdquo; was substituted for the words &ldquo;for such term of years as the court in its discretion shall determine&rdquo; which appeared in said section 408a of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. This change was made in order to remove all doubt as to whether &ldquo;term of years&rdquo; includes life imprisonment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made in phraseology.</p>
