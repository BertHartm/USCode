<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Summoning Grand Juries.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Generally</em>. The court shall order one or more grand juries to be summoned at such time as the public interest requires. The grand jury shall consist of not less than 16 nor more than 23 members. The court shall direct that a sufficient number of legally qualified persons be summoned to meet this requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Alternate Jurors</em>. The court may direct that alternate jurors may be designated at the time a grand jury is selected. Alternate jurors in the order in which they were designated may thereafter be impanelled as provided in subdivision (g) of this rule. Alternate jurors shall be drawn in the same manner and shall have the same qualifications as the regular jurors, and if impanelled shall be subject to the same challenges, shall take the same oath and shall have the same functions, powers, facilities and privileges as the regular jurors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Objections to Grand Jury and to Grand Jurors.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Challenges</em>. The attorney for the government or a defendant who has been held to answer in the district court may challenge the array of jurors on the ground that the grand jury was not selected, drawn or summoned in accordance with law, and may challenge an individual juror on the ground that the juror is not legally qualified. Challenges shall be made before the administration of the oath to the jurors and shall be tried by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Motion To Dismiss</em>. A motion to dismiss the indictment may be based on objections to the array or on the lack of legal qualification of an individual juror, if not previously determined upon challenge. It shall be made in the manner prescribed in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1867(e) and shall be granted under the conditions prescribed in that statute. An indictment shall not be dismissed on the ground that one or more members of the grand jury were not legally qualified if it appears from the record kept pursuant to subdivision (c) of this rule that 12 or more jurors, after deducting the number not legally qualified, concurred in finding the indictment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Foreperson and Deputy Foreperson</cap-smallcap>. The court shall appoint one of the jurors to be foreperson and another to be deputy foreperson. The foreperson shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations and shall sign all indictments. The foreperson or another juror designated by the foreperson shall keep a record of the number of jurors concurring in the finding of every indictment and shall file the record with the clerk of the court, but the record shall not be made public except on order of the court. During the absence of the foreperson, the deputy foreperson shall act as foreperson.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Who May Be Present</cap-smallcap>. Attorneys for the government, the witness under examination, interpreters when needed and, for the purpose of taking the evidence, a stenographer or operator of a recording device may be present while the grand jury is in session, but no person other than the jurors may be present while the grand jury is deliberating or voting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Recording and Disclosure of Proceedings.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Recording of Proceedings</em>. All proceedings, except when the grand jury is deliberating or voting, shall be recorded stenographically or by an electronic recording device. An unintentional failure of any recording to reproduce all or any portion of a proceeding shall not affect the validity of the prosecution. The recording or reporter's notes or any transcript prepared therefrom shall remain in the custody or control of the attorney for the government unless otherwise ordered by the court in a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>General Rule of Secrecy</em>. A grand juror, an interpreter, a stenographer, an operator of a recording device, a typist who transcribes recorded testimony, an attorney for the government, or any person to whom disclosure is made under paragraph (3)(A)(ii) of this subdivision shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury, except as otherwise provided for in these rules. No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with this rule. A knowing violation of Rule 6 may be punished as a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Exceptions.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Disclosure otherwise prohibited by this rule of matters occurring before the grand jury, other than its deliberations and the vote of any grand juror, may be made to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an attorney for the government for use in the performance of such attorney's duty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such government personnel (including personnel of a state or subdivision of a state) as are deemed necessary by an attorney for the government to assist an attorney for the government in the perform<!-- PDFPage:24 -->ance of such attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any person to whom matters are disclosed under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph shall not utilize that grand jury material for any purpose other than assisting the attorney for the government in the performance of such attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law. An attorney for the government shall promptly provide the district court, before which was impaneled the grand jury whose material has been so disclosed, with the names of the persons to whom such disclosure has been made, and shall certify that the attorney has advised such persons of their obligation of secrecy under this rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Disclosure otherwise prohibited by this rule of matters occurring before the grand jury may also be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) when permitted by a court at the request of the defendant, upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) when the disclosure is made by an attorney for the government to another federal grand jury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) when permitted by a court at the request of an attorney for the government, upon a showing that such matters may disclose a violation of state criminal law, to an appropriate official of a state or subdivision of a state for the purpose of enforcing such law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If the court orders disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury, the disclosure shall be made in such manner, at such time, and under such conditions as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A petition for disclosure pursuant to subdivision (e)(3)(C)(i) shall be filed in the district where the grand jury convened. Unless the hearing is ex parte, which it may be when the petitioner is the government, the petitioner shall serve written notice of the petition upon (i) the attorney for the government, (ii) the parties to the judicial proceeding if disclosure is sought in connection with such a proceeding, and (iii) such other persons as the court may direct. The court shall afford those persons a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) If the judicial proceeding giving rise to the petition is in a federal district court in another district, the court shall transfer the matter to that court unless it can reasonably obtain sufficient knowledge of the proceeding to determine whether disclosure is proper. The court shall order transmitted to the court to which the matter is transferred the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand jury secrecy. The court to which the matter is transferred shall afford the aforementioned persons a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <em>Sealed Indictments</em>. The federal magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial. Thereupon the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person shall disclose the return of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <em>Closed Hearing</em>. Subject to any right to an open hearing in contempt proceedings, the court shall order a hearing on matters affecting a grand jury proceeding to be closed to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <em>Sealed Records</em>. Records, orders and subpoenas relating to grand jury proceedings shall be kept under seal to the extent and for such time as is necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Finding and Return of Indictment</cap-smallcap>. An indictment may be found only upon the concurrence of 12 or more jurors. The indictment shall be returned by the grand jury to a federal magistrate judge in open court. If a complaint or information is pending against the defendant and 12 jurors do not concur in finding an indictment, the foreperson shall so report to a federal magistrate judge in writing forthwith.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Discharge and Excuse</cap-smallcap>. A grand jury shall serve until discharged by the court, but no grand jury may serve more than 18 months unless the court extends the service of the grand jury for a period of six months or less upon a determination that such extension is in the public interest. At any time for cause shown the court may excuse a juror either temporarily or permanently, and in the latter event the court may impanel another person in place of the juror excused.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1944</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. The first sentence of this rule vests in the court full discretion as to the number of grand juries to be summoned and as to the times when they should be convened. This provision supersedes the existing law, which limits the authority of the court to summon more than one grand jury at the same time. At present two grand juries may be convened simultaneously only in a district which has a city or borough of at least 300,000 inhabitants, and three grand juries only in the Southern District of New York, 28 U.S.C. [former] 421 (Grand juries; when, how and by whom summoned; length of service). This statute has been construed, however, as only limiting the authority of the court to summon more than one grand jury for a single place of holding court, and as not circumscribing the power to convene simultaneously several grand juries at different points within the same district, <em>Morris v. United States</em>, 128 F.2d 912 (C.C.A. 5th); <em>United States v. Perlstein</em>, 39 F.Supp. 965 (D.N.J.).</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The provision that the grand jury shall consist of not less than 16 and not more than 23 members continues existing law, 28 U.S.C. 419 [now 18 U.S.C. 3321] (Grand jurors; number when less than required number).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:25 --><p class="note-body">3. The rule does not affect or deal with the method of summoning and selecting grand juries. Existing statutes on the subjects are not superseded. See 28 U.S.C. 411&ndash;426 [now 1861&ndash;1870]. As these provisions of law relate to jurors for both criminal and civil cases, it seemed best not to deal with this subject.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b)(1). Challenges to the array and to individual jurors, although rarely invoked in connection with the selection of grand juries, are nevertheless permitted in the Federal courts and are continued by this rule, <em>United States v. Gale</em>, 109 U.S. 65, 69&ndash;70; <em>Clawson v. United States</em>, 114 U.S. 477; <em>Agnew v. United States</em>, 165 U.S. 36, 44. It is not contemplated, however, that defendants held for action of the grand jury shall receive notice of the time and place of the impaneling of a grand jury, or that defendants in custody shall be brought to court to attend at the selection of the grand jury. Failure to challenge is not a waiver of any objection. The objection may still be interposed by motion under Rule 6(b)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b)(2). 1. The motion provided by this rule takes the place of a plea in abatement, or motion to quash. <em>Crowley v. United States</em>, 194 U.S. 461, 469&ndash;474; <em>United States v. Gale, supra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">2. The second sentence of the rule is a restatement of 18 U.S.C. [former] 554(a) (Indictments and presentments; objection on ground of unqualified juror barred where twelve qualified jurors concurred; record of number concurring), and introduces no change in existing law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). 1. This rule generally is a restatement of existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 554(a) and 28 U.S.C. [former] 420. Failure of the foreman to sign or endorse the indictment is an irregularity and is not fatal, <em>Frisbie v. United States</em>, 157 U.S. 160, 163&ndash;165.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The provision for the appointment of a deputy foreman is new. Its purpose is to facilitate the transaction of business if the foreman is absent. Such a provision is found in the law of at least one State, N.Y. Code Criminal Procedure, sec. 244.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This rule generally continues existing law. See 18 U.S.C. [former] 556 (Indictments and presentments; defects of form); and 5 U.S.C. 310 [now 28 U.S.C. 515(a)] (Conduct of legal proceedings).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). 1. This rule continues the traditional practice of secrecy on the party of members of the grand jury, except when the court permits a disclosure, <em>Schmidt v. United States</em>, 115 F.2d 394 (C.C.A. 6th); <em>United States v. American Medical Association</em>, 26 F.Supp. 429 (D.C.); Cf. <em>Atwell v. United States</em>, 162 F. 97 (C.C.A. 4th); and see 18 U.S.C. [former] 554(a) (Indictments and presentments; objection on ground of unqualified juror barred where twelve qualified jurors concurred; record of number concurring). Government attorneys are entitled to disclosure of grand jury proceedings, other than the deliberations and the votes of the jurors, inasmuch as they may be present in the grand jury room during the presentation of evidence. The rule continues this practice.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on witnesses. The existing practice on this point varies among the districts. The seal of secrecy on witnesses seems an unnecessary hardship and may lead to injustice if a witness is not permitted to make a disclosure to counsel or to an associate.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The last sentence authorizing the court to seal indictments continues present practice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). This rule continues existing law, 18 U.S.C. [former] 554 (Indictments and presentments; by twelve grand jurors). The purpose of the last sentence is to provide means for a prompt release of a defendant if in custody, or exoneration of bail if he is on bail, in the event that the grand jury considers the case of a defendant held for its action and finds no indictment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (g). Under existing law a grand jury serves only during the term for which it is summoned, but the court may extend its period of service for as long as 18 months, 28 U.S.C. [former] 421. During the extended period, however, a grand jury may conduct only investigations commenced during the original term. The rule continues the 18 months&rsquo; maximum for the period of service of a grand jury, but provides for such service as a matter of course, unless the court terminates it at an earlier date. The matter is left in the discretion of the court, as it is under existing law. The expiration of a term of court as a time limitation is elsewhere entirely eliminated (Rule 45(c)) and specific time limitations are substituted therefor. This was previously done by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the civil side of the courts (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 6(c) [28 U.S.C., Appendix]). The elimination of the requirement that at an extended period the grand jury may continue only investigations previously commenced, will obviate such a controversy as was presented in <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 319 U.S. 503.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d).&mdash;The amendment makes it clear that recording devices may be used to take evidence at grand jury sessions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e).&mdash;The amendment makes it clear that the operator of a recording device and a typist who transcribes recorded testimony are bound to the obligation of secrecy.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (f).&mdash;A minor change conforms the language to what doubtless is the practice. The need for a report to the court that no indictment has been found may be present even though the defendant has not been &ldquo;held to answer.&rdquo; If the defendant is in custody or has given bail, some official record should be made of the grand jury action so that the defendant can be released or his bail exonerated.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b)(2) is amended to incorporate by express reference the provisions of the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968. That act provides in part:</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures prescribed by this section shall be the exclusive means by which a person accused of a Federal crime [or] the Attorney General of the United States  may challenge any jury on the ground that such jury was not selected in conformity with the provisions of this title. [28 U.S.C. &sect;1867(c)]</p>
<p class="note-body">Under rule 12(e) the judge shall decide the motion before trial or order it deferred until after verdict. The authority which the judge has to delay his ruling until after verdict gives him an option which can be exercised to prevent the unnecessary delay of a trial in the event that a motion attacking a grand jury is made on the eve of the trial. In addition, rule 12(c) gives the judge authority to fix the time at which pretrial motions must be made. Failure to make a pretrial motion at the appropriate time may constitute a waiver under rule 12(f).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1976 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the proposed amendment to rule 6(f), an indictment may be returned to a federal magistrate. (&ldquo;Federal magistrate&rdquo; is defined in rule 54(c) as including a United States magistrate as defined in 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;631&ndash;639 and a judge of the United States.) This change will foreclose the possibility of noncompliance with the Speedy Trial Act timetable because of the nonavailability of a judge. Upon the effective date of certain provisions of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, the timely return of indictments will become a matter of critical importance; for the year commencing July 1, 1976, indictments must be returned within 60 days of arrest or summons, for the year following within 45 days, and thereafter within 30 days. 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3161(b) and (f), 3163(a). The problem is acute in a one-judge district where, if the judge is holding court in another part of the district, or is otherwise absent, the return of the indictment must await the later reappearance of the judge at the place where the grand jury is sitting.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:26 --><p class="note-body">A corresponding change has been made to that part of subdivision (f) which concerns the reporting of a &ldquo;no bill,&rdquo; and to that part of subdivision (e) which concerns keeping an indictment secret.</p>
<p class="note-body">The change in the third sentence of rule 6(f) is made so as to cover all situations in which by virtue of a pending complaint or information the defendant is in custody or released under some form of conditional release.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1977 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The proposed definition of &ldquo;attorneys for the government&rdquo; in subdivision (e) is designed to facilitate an increasing need, on the part of government attorneys, to make use of outside expertise in complex litigation. The phrase &ldquo;other government personnel&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, employees of administrative agencies and government departments.</p>
<p class="note-body">Present subdivision (e) provides for disclosure &ldquo;to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties.&rdquo; This limitation is designed to further &ldquo;the long established policy that maintains the secrecy of the grand jury in federal courts.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Procter and Gamble Co</em>., 356 U.S. 677 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">As defined in rule 54(c), &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Attorney for the government&rsquo; means the Attorney General, an authorized assistant of the Attorney General, a United States Attorney, an authorized assistant of a United States Attorney and when applicable to cases arising under the laws of Guam .&rdquo; The limited nature of this definition is pointed out in <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings</em>, 309 F.2d 440 (3d Cir. 1962) at 443:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The term attorneys for the government is restrictive in its application.  If it had been intended that the attorneys for the administrative agencies were to have free access to matters occurring before a grand jury, the rule would have so provided.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed amendment reflects the fact that there is often government personnel assisting the Justice Department in grand jury proceedings. In <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation of William H. Pflaumer & Sons, Inc</em>., 53 F.R.D. 464 (E.D.Pa. 1971), the opinion quoted the United States Attorney:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">It is absolutely necessary in grand jury investigations involving analysis of books and records, for the government attorneys to rely upon investigative personnel (from the government agencies) for assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">See also 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;6.05 at 6&ndash;28 (2d ed. Cipes, 1969):</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The rule [6(e)] has presented a problem, however, with respect to attorneys and nonattorneys who are assisting in preparation of a case for the grand jury.  These assistants often cannot properly perform their work without having access to grand jury minutes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although case law is limited, the trend seems to be in the direction of allowing disclosure to government personnel who assist attorneys for the government in situations where their expertise is required. This is subject to the qualification that the matters disclosed be used only for the purposes of the grand jury investigation. The court may inquire as to the good faith of the assisting personnel, to ensure that access to material is not merely a subterfuge to gather evidence unattainable by means other than the grand jury. This approach was taken in <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation of William H. Pflaumer & Sons, Inc</em>., 53 F.R.D. 464 (E.D.Pa. 1971); <em>In re April 1956 Term Grand Jury</em>, 239 F.2d 263 (7th Cir. 1956); <em>United States v. Anzelimo</em>, 319 F.Supp. 1106 (D.C.La. 1970). Another case, <em>Application of Kelly</em>, 19 F.R.D. 269 (S.D.N.Y. 1956), assumed, without deciding, that assistance given the attorney for the government by IRS and FBI agents was authorized.</p>
<p class="note-body">The change at line 27 reflects the fact that under the Bail Reform Act of 1966 some persons will be released without requiring bail. See 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3146, 3148.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the proposed amendment to rule 6(f), an indictment may be returned to a federal magistrate. (&ldquo;Federal magistrate&rdquo; is defined in rule 54(c) as including a United States magistrate as defined in 28 U.S.C. &sect;631&ndash;639 and a judge of the United States.) This change will foreclose the possibility of noncompliance with the Speedy Trial Act timetable because of the nonavailability of a judge. Upon the effective date of certain provisions of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, the timely return of indictments will become a matter of critical importance; for the year commencing July 1, 1976, indictments must be returned within 60 days of arrest or summons, for the year following within 45 days, and thereafter within 30 days. 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3161(b) and (f), 3163(a). The problem is acute in a one-judge district where, if the judge is holding court in another part of the district, or is otherwise absent, the return of the indictment must await the later reappearance of the judge at the place where the grand jury is sitting.</p>
<p class="note-body">A corresponding change has been made to that part of subdivision (f) which concerns the reporting of a &ldquo;no bill,&rdquo; and to that part of subdivision (e) which concerns keeping an indictment secret.</p>
<p class="note-body">The change in the third sentence of rule 6(f) is made so as to cover all situations in which by virtue of a pending complaint or information the defendant is in custody or released under some form of conditional release.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 95&ndash;354; 1977 Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 6(e) currently provides that &ldquo;disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties.&rdquo; Rule 54(c) defines attorneys for the government to mean &ldquo;the Attorney General, an authorized assistant to the Attorney General, a United States attorney, and an authorized assistant of the United States attorney, and when applicable to cases arising under the laws of Guam, means the Attorney General of Guam. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court proposal would change Rule 6(e) by adding the following new language:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">For purposes of this subdivision, &ldquo;attorneys for the government&rdquo; includes those enumerated in Rule 54(c); it also includes such other government personnel as are necessary to assist the attorneys for the government in the performance of their duties.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">It would also make a series of changes in the rule designed to make its provisions consistent with other provisions in the Rules and the Bail Reform Act of 1966.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Advisory Committee note states that the proposed amendment is intended &ldquo;to facilitate an increasing need, on the part of Government attorneys to make use of outside expertise in complex litigation&rdquo;. The note indicated that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Although case law is limited, the trend seems to be in the direction of allowing disclosure to Government personnel who assist attorneys for the Government in situations where their expertise is required. This is subject to the qualification that the matter disclosed be used only for the purposes of the grand jury investigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is past history at this point that the Supreme Court proposal attracted substantial criticism, which seemed to stem more from the lack of precision in defining, and consequent confusion and uncertainty concerning, the intended scope of the proposed change than from a fundamental disagreement with the objective.</p>
<p class="note-body">Attorneys for the Government in the performance of their duties with a grand jury must possess the authority to utilize the services of other government employees. Federal crimes are &ldquo;investigated&rdquo; by the FBI, the IRS, or by Treasury agents and not by government prosecutors or the citizens who sit on grand juries. Federal agents gather and present information relating to criminal behavior to prosecutors who analyze and evaluate it and present it to grand juries. Often the prosecutors need the assistance of the agents in evaluating evidence. Also, if further investigation is required during or after grand jury proceedings, or even <!-- PDFPage:27 -->during the course of criminal trials, the Federal agents must do it. There is no reason for a barrier of secrecy to exist between the facets of the criminal justice system upon which we all depend to enforce the criminal laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">The parameters of the authority of an attorney for the government to disclose grand jury information in the course of performing his own duties is not defined by Rule 6. However, a commonsense interpretation prevails, permitting &ldquo;Representatives of other government agencies actively assisting United States attorneys in a grand jury investigation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. access to grand jury material in the performance of their duties.&rdquo; Yet projected against this current practice, and the weight of case law, is the anomalous language of Rule 6(e) itself, which, in its present state of uncertainty, is spawning some judicial decisions highly restrictive of the use of government experts that require the government to &ldquo;show the necessity (to the Court) for each particular person's aid rather than showing merely a general necessity for assistance, expert or otherwise&rdquo; and that make Rule 6(e) orders subject to interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this state of uncertainty, the Committee believes it is timely to redraft subdivision (e) of Rule 6 to make it clear.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (1) as proposed by the Committee states the general rule that a grand jury, an interpreter, a stenographer, an operator of a recording device, a typist who transcribes recorded testimony, an attorney for the government, or government personnel to whom disclosure is made under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury, except as otherwise provided in these rules. It also expressly provides that a knowing violation of Rule 6 may be punished as a contempt of court. In addition, it carries forward the current provision that no obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with this Rule.</p>
<p class="note-body">Having stated the general rule of nondisclosure, paragraph (2) sets forth exemptions from nondisclosure. Subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) provides that disclosure otherwise prohibited, other than the grand jury deliberations and the vote of any grand juror, may be made to an attorney for the government for use in the performance of his duty and to such personnel as are deemed necessary by an attorney for the government to assist an attorney for the government in the performance of such attorney's duty to enforce Federal criminal law. In order to facilitate resolution of subsequent claims of improper disclosure, subparagraph (B) further provides that the names of government personnel designated to assist the attorney for the government shall be promptly provided to the district court and such personnel shall not utilize grand jury material for any purpose other than assisting the attorney for the government in the performance of such attorney's duty to enforce Federal criminal law. Although not expressly required by the rule, the Committee contemplates that the names of such personnel will generally be furnished to the court before disclosure is made to them. Subparagraph (C) permits disclosure as directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding or, at the request of the defendant, upon a showing that grounds may exist for dismissing the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury. Paragraph (3) carries forward the last sentence of current Rule 6(e) with the technical changes recommended by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Rule as redrafted is designed to accommodate the belief on the one hand that Federal prosecutors should be able, without the time-consuming requirement of prior judicial interposition, to make such disclosures of grand jury information to other government personnel as they deem necessary to facilitate the performance of their duties relating to criminal law enforcement. On the other hand, the Rule seeks to allay the concerns of those who fear that such prosecutorial power will lead to misuse of the grand jury to enforce non-criminal Federal laws by (1) providing a clear prohibition, subject to the penalty of contempt and (2) requiring that a court order under paragraph (C) be obtained to authorize such a disclosure. There is, however, no intent to preclude the use of grand jury-developed evidence for civil law enforcement purposes. On the contrary, there is no reason why such use is improper, assuming that the grand jury was utilized for the legitimate purpose of a criminal investigation. Accordingly, the Committee believes and intends that the basis for a court's refusal to issue an order under paragraph (C) to enable the government to disclose grand jury information in a non-criminal proceeding should be no more restrictive than is the case today under prevailing court decisions. It is contemplated that the judicial hearing in connection with an application for a court order by the government under subparagraph (3)(C)(i) should be <em>ex parte</em> so as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, grand jury secrecy.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Modification of Proposed 1977 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2(a) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;78 provided in part that the amendment proposed by the Supreme Court [in its order of Apr. 26, 1977] to subdivision (e) of rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [subd. (e) of this rule] is approved in a modified form.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(1). Proposed subdivision (e)(1) requires that all proceedings, except when the grand jury is deliberating or voting, be recorded. The existing rule does not require that grand jury proceedings be recorded. The provision in rule 6(d) that &ldquo;a stenographer or operator of a recording device may be present while the grand jury is in session&rdquo; has been taken to mean that recordation is permissive and not mandatory; see <em>United States v. Aloisio</em>, 440 F.2d 705 (7th Cir. 1971), collecting the cases. However, the cases rather frequently state that recordation of the proceedings is the better practice; see <em>United States v. Aloisio</em>, supra; <em>United States v. Cramer</em>, 447 F.2d 210 (2d Cir. 1971), <em>Schlinsky v. United States</em>, 379 F.2d 735 (1st Cir. 1967); and some cases require the district court, after a demand to exercise discretion as to whether the proceedings should be recorded. <em>United States v. Price</em>, 474 F.2d 1223 (9th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Thoresen</em>, 428 F.2d 654 (9th Cir. 1970). Some district courts have adopted a recording requirement. See e.g. <em>United States v. Aloisio</em>, supra; <em>United States v. Gramolini</em>, 301 F.Supp. 39 (D.R.I. 1969). Recording of grand jury proceedings is currently a requirement in a number of states. See, e.g., Cal.Pen.Code &sect;&sect;938&ndash;938.3; Iowa Code Ann. &sect;772.4; Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. &sect;28.460; and Ky.R.Crim.P. &sect;5.16(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The assumption underlying the proposal is that the cost of such recording is justified by the contribution made to the improved administration of criminal justice. See <em>United States v. Gramolini</em>, supra, noting: &ldquo;Nor can it be claimed that the cost of recordation is prohibitive; in an electronic age, the cost of recordation must be categorized as miniscule.&rdquo; For a discussion of the success of electronic recording in Alaska, see Reynolds, Alaska's Ten Years of Electronic Reporting, 56 A.B.A.J. 1080 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Among the benefits to be derived from a recordation requirement are the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Ensuring that the defendant may impeach a prosecution witness on the basis of his prior inconsistent statements before the grand jury. As noted in the opinion of Oakes, J., in <em>United States v. Cramer</em>: &ldquo;First since <em>Dennis v. United States</em>, 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966), a defendant has been entitled to examine the grand jury testimony of witnesses against him. On this point, the Court was unanimous, holding that there was &lsquo;no justification&rsquo; for the District of Columbia Court of Appeals&rsquo; &lsquo;relying upon [the] &ldquo;assumption&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; that &lsquo;no inconsistencies would have come to light.&rsquo; The Court's decision was based on the general proposition that &lsquo;[i]n our adversary system for deter<!-- PDFPage:28 -->mining guilt or innocence, it is rarely justifiable for the prosecution to have exclusive access to a storehouse of relevant facts.&rsquo; In the case at bar the prosecution did have exclusive access to the grand jury testimony of the witness Sager, by virtue of being present, and the defense had none&mdash;to determine whether there were any inconsistencies with, say, his subsequent testimony as to damaging admissions by the defendant and his attorney Richard Thaler. The Government claims, and it is supported by the majority here, that there is no problem since defendants were given the benefit of Sager's subsequent statements including these admissions as Jencks Act materials. But assuming this to be true, it does not cure the basic infirmity that the defense could not know whether the witness testified inconsistently before the grand jury.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Ensuring that the testimony received by the grand jury is trustworthy. In <em>United States v. Cramer</em>, Oakes, J., also observed: &ldquo;The recording of testimony is in a very real sense a circumstantial guaranty of trustworthiness. Without the restraint of being subject to prosecution for perjury, a restraint which is wholly meaningless or nonexistent if the testimony is unrecorded, a witness may make baseless accusations founded on hearsay or false accusations, all resulting in the indictment of a fellow citizen for a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Restraining prosecutorial abuses before the grand jury. As noted in <em>United States v. Gramolini</em>: &ldquo;In no way does recordation inhibit the grand jury's investigation. True, recordation restrains certain prosecutorial practices which might, in its absence be used, but that is no reason not to record. Indeed, a sophisticated prosecutor must acknowledge that there develops between a grand jury and the prosecutor with whom the jury is closeted a rapport&mdash;a dependency relationship&mdash;which can easily be turned into an instrument of influence on grand jury deliberations. Recordation is the most effective restraint upon such potential abuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Supporting the case made by the prosecution at trial. Oakes, J., observed in <em>United States v. Cramer</em>: &ldquo;The benefits of having grand jury testimony recorded do not all inure to the defense. See, e.g., <em>United States v. DeSisto</em>, 329 F.2d 929, 934: (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 979, 84 S.Ct. 1885, 12 L.Ed.2d 747 (1964) (conviction sustained in part on basis of witnesses's prior sworn testimony before grand jury).&rdquo; Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) excludes from the category of hearsay the prior inconsistent testimony of a witness given before a grand jury. <em>United States v. Morgan</em>, 555 F.2d 238 (9th Cir. 1977). See also <em>United States v. Carlson</em>, 547 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1976), admitting under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5) the grand jury testimony of a witness who refused to testify at trial because of threats by the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Commentators have also supported a recording requirement. 8 Moore, Federal Practice par. 6.02[2][d] (2d ed. 1972) states: &ldquo;Fairness to the defendant would seem to compel a change in the practice, particularly in view of the 1970 amendment to 18 USC &sect;3500 making grand jury testimony of government witnesses available at trial for purposes of impeachment. The requirement of a record may also prove salutary in controlling overreaching or improper examination of witnesses by the prosecutor.&rdquo; Similarly, 1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure&mdash;Criminal &sect;103 (1969), states that the present rule &ldquo;ought to be changed, either by amendment or by judicial construction. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance to the defense of access to the transcript of the grand jury proceedings [citing <em>Dennis</em>]. A defendant cannot have that advantage if the proceedings go unrecorded.&rdquo; American Bar Association, Report of the Special Committee on Federal Rules of Procedure, 52 F.R.D. 87, 94&ndash;95 (1971), renews the committee's 1965 recommendation &ldquo;that all accusatorial grand jury proceedings either be transcribed by a reporter or recorded by electronic means.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Under proposed subdivision (e)(1), if the failure to record is unintentional, the failure to record would not invalidate subsequent judicial proceedings. Under present law, the failure to compel production of grand jury testimony where there is no record is not reversible error. See <em>Wyatt v. United States</em>, 388 F.2d 395 (10th Cir. 1968).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision that the recording or reporter's notes or any transcript prepared therefrom are to remain in the custody or control (as where the notes are in the immediate possession of a contract reporter employed by the Department of Justice) of the attorney for the government is in accord with present practice. It is specifically recognized, however, that the court in a particular case may have reason to order otherwise.</p>
<p class="note-body">It must be emphasized that the proposed changes in rule 6(e) deal only with the recording requirement, and in no way expand the circumstances in which disclosure of the grand jury proceedings is permitted or required. &ldquo;Secrecy of grand jury proceedings is not jeopardized by recordation. The making of a record cannot be equated with disclosure of its contents, and disclosure is controlled by other means.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Price</em>, 474 F.2d 1223 (9th Cir. 1973). Specifically, the proposed changes do not provide for copies of the grand jury minutes to defendants as a matter of right, as is the case in some states. See, e.g., Cal.Pen.Code &sect;938.1; Iowa Code Ann. &sect;772.4. The matter of disclosure continues to be governed by other provisions, such as rule 16(a) (recorded statements of the defendant), 18 U.S.C. &sect;3500 (statements of government witnesses), and the unchanged portions of rule 6(e), and the cases interpreting these provisions. See e.g., <em>United States v. Howard</em>, 433 F.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1970), and <em>Beatrice Foods Co. v. United States</em>, 312 F.2d 29 (8th Cir. 1963), concerning the showing which must be made of improper matters occurring before the grand jury before disclosure is required.</p>
<p class="note-body">Likewise, the proposed changes in rule 6(e) are not intended to make any change regarding whether a defendant may challenge a grand jury indictment. The Supreme Court has declined to hold that defendants may challenge indictments on the ground that they are not supported by sufficient or competent evidence. <em>Costello v. United States</em>, 350 U.S. 359 (1956); <em>Lawn v. United States</em>, 355 U.S. 339 (1958); <em>United States v. Blue</em>, 384 U.S. 251 (1966). Nor are the changes intended to permit the defendant to challenge the conduct of the attorney for the government before the grand jury absent a preliminary factual showing of serious misconduct.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(3)(C). The sentence added to subdivision (e)(3)(C) gives express recognition to the fact that if the court orders disclosure, it may determine the circumstances of the disclosure. For example, if the proceedings are electronically recorded, the court would have discretion in an appropriate case to deny defendant the right to a transcript at government expense. While it takes special skills to make a stenographic record understandable, an electronic recording can be understood by merely listening to it, thus avoiding the expense of transcription.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1983 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(3)(C). New subdivision (e)(3)(C)(iii) recognizes that it is permissible for the attorney for the government to make disclosure of matters occurring before one grand jury to another federal grand jury. Even absent a specific provision to that effect, the courts have permitted such disclosure in some circumstances. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co</em>. 310 U.S. 150 (1940); <em>United States v. Garcia</em>, 420 F.2d 309 (2d Cir. 1970). In this kind of situation, &ldquo;[s]ecrecy of grand jury materials should be protected almost as well by the safeguards at the second grand jury proceeding, including the oath of the jurors, as by judicial supervision of the disclosure of such materials.&rdquo; <em>United States v. Malatesta</em>, 583 F.2d 748 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(3)(D). In <em>Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest</em>, 441 U.S. 211 (1979), the Court held on the facts there presented that it was an abuse of discretion for the district judge to order disclosure of grand jury transcripts for use in civil proceedings in another district where that judge had insufficient knowledge of those proceedings to make a determination of the need <!-- PDFPage:29 -->for disclosure. The Court suggested a &ldquo;better practice&rdquo; on those facts, but declared that &ldquo;procedures to deal with the many variations are best left to the rulemaking procedures established by Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of subdivision (e)(3)(D) makes it clear that when disclosure is sought under subdivision (e)(2)(C)(i), the petition is to be filed in the district where the grand jury was convened, whether or not it is the district of the &ldquo;judicial proceeding&rdquo; giving rise to the petition. Courts which have addressed the question have generally taken this view, e.g., <em>Illinois v. Sarbaugh</em>, 522 F.2d 768 (7th Cir. 1977). As stated in <em>Douglas Oil,</em></p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">those who seek grand jury transcripts have little choice other than to file a request with the court that supervised the grand jury, as it is the only court with control over the transcripts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Quite apart from the practical necessity, the policies underlying Rule 6(e) dictate that the grand jury's supervisory court participate in reviewing such requests, as it is in the best position to determine the continuing need for grand jury secrecy. Ideally, the judge who supervised the grand jury should review the request for disclosure, as he will have firsthand knowledge of the grand jury's activities. But even other judges of the district where the grand jury sat may be able to discover facts affecting the need for secrecy more easily than would judges from elsewhere around the country. The records are in the custody of the District Court, and therefore are readily available for references. Moreover, the personnel of that court&mdash;particularly those of the United States Attorney's Office who worked with the grand jury&mdash;are more likely to be informed about the grand jury proceedings than those in a district that had no prior experience with the subject of the request.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence requires the petitioner to serve notice of his petition upon several persons who, by the third sentence, are recognized as entitled to appear and be heard on the matter. The notice requirement ensures that all interested parties, if they wish, may make a timely appearance. Absent such notice, these persons, who then might only learn of the order made in response to the motion after it was entered, have had to resort to the cumbersome and inefficient procedure of a motion to vacate the order. <em>In re Special February 1971 Grand Jury v. Conlisk</em>, 490 F.2d 894 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>
<p class="note-body">Though some authority is to be found that parties to the judicial proceeding giving rise to the motion are not entitled to intervene, in that &ldquo;the order to produce was not directed to&rdquo; them, <em>United States v. American Oil Co</em>., 456 F.2d 1043 (3d Cir. 1972), that position was rejected in <em>Douglas Oil</em>, where it was noted that such persons have standing &ldquo;to object to the disclosure order, as release of the transcripts to their civil adversaries could result in substantial injury to them.&rdquo; As noted in <em>Illinois v. Sarbaugh</em>, supra, while present rule 6(e) &ldquo;omits to state whether any one is entitled to object to disclosure,&rdquo; the rule</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">seems to contemplate a proceeding of some kind, judicial proceedings are not normally <em>ex parte</em>, and persons in the situation of the intervenors [parties to the civil proceeding] are likely to be the only ones to object to an order for disclosure. If they are not allowed to appear, the advantages of an adversary proceeding are lost.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">If the judicial proceeding is a class action, notice to the representative is sufficient.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment also recognizes that the attorney for the government in the district where the grand jury convened also has an interest in the matter and should be allowed to be heard. It may sometimes be the case, as in <em>Douglas Oil</em>, that the prosecutor will have relatively little concern for secrecy, at least as compared with certain parties to the civil proceeding. Nonetheless, it is appropriate to recognize that generally the attorney for the government is entitled to be heard so that he may represent what <em>Douglas Oil</em> characterizes as &ldquo;the public interest in secrecy,&rdquo; including the government's legitimate concern about &ldquo;the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand juries&rdquo; of unduly liberal disclosure.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence leaves it to the court to decide whether any other persons should receive notice and be allowed to intervene. This is appropriate, for the necessity for and feasibility of involving others may vary substantially from case to case. In <em>Douglas Oil</em>, it was noted that the individual who produced before the grand jury the information now sought has an interest in the matter:</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Fear of future retribution or social stigma may act as powerful deterrents to those who would come forward and aid the grand jury in the performance of its duties. Concern as to the future consequences of frank and full testimony is heightened where the witness is an employee of a company under investigation.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Notice to such persons, however is by no means inevitably necessary, and in some cases the information sought may have reached the grand jury from such a variety of sources that it is not practicable to involve these sources in the disclosure proceeding. Similarly, while <em>Douglas Oil</em> notes that rule 6(e) secrecy affords &ldquo;protection of the innocent accused from disclosure of the accusation made against him before the grand jury,&rdquo; it is appropriate to leave to the court whether that interest requires representation directly by the grand jury target at this time. When deemed necessary to protect the identity of such other persons, it would be a permissible alternative for the government or the court directly to give notice to these other persons, and thus the rule does not foreclose such action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The notice requirement in the second sentence is inapplicable if the hearing is to be <em>ex parte</em>. The legislative history of rule 6(e) states: &ldquo;It is contemplated that the judicial hearing in connection with an application for a court order by the government, under subparagraph (3)(C)(i) should be <em>ex parte</em> so as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, grand jury secrecy.&rdquo; S.Rep. No. 95&ndash;354, 1977 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News p. 532. Although such cases are distinguishable from other cases arising under this subdivision because internal regulations limit further disclosure of information disclosed to the government, the rule provides only that the hearing &ldquo;may&rdquo; be <em>ex parte</em> when the petitioner is the government. This allows the court to decide that matter based upon the circumstances of the particular case. For example, an <em>ex parte</em> proceeding is much less likely to be appropriate if the government acts as petitioner as an accommodation to, e.g., a state agency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(3)(E). Under the first sentence in new subdivision (e)(3)(E), the petitioner or any intervenor might seek to have the matter transferred to the federal district court where the judicial proceeding giving rise to the petition is pending. Usually, it will be the petitioner, who is seeking disclosure, who will desire the transfer, but this is not inevitably the case. An intervenor might seek transfer on the ground that the other court, with greater knowledge of the extent of the need, would be less likely to conclude &ldquo;that the material  is needed to avoid a possible injustice&rdquo; (the test under <em>Douglas Oil)</em>. The court may transfer on its own motion, for as noted in <em>Douglas Oil</em>, if transfer is the better course of action it should not be foreclosed &ldquo;merely because the parties have failed to specify the relief to which they are entitled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It must be emphasized that transfer is proper only if the proceeding giving rise to the petition &ldquo;is in federal district court in another district.&rdquo; If, for example, the proceeding is located in another district but is at the state level, a situation encompassed within rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i), <em>In re Special February 1971 Grand Jury v. Conlisk</em>, supra, there is no occasion to transfer. Ultimate resolution of the matter cannot be placed in the hands of the state court, and in such a case the federal court in that place would lack what <em>Douglas Oil</em> recognizes as the benefit to be derived from transfer: &ldquo;first-hand knowledge of the litigation in which the transcripts allegedly are needed.&rdquo; Formal transfer is unnec<!-- PDFPage:30 -->essary in intradistrict cases, even when the grand jury court and judicial proceeding court are not in the same division.</p>
<p class="note-body">As stated in the first sentence, transfer by the court is appropriate &ldquo;unless it can reasonably obtain sufficient knowledge of the proceeding to determine whether disclosure is proper.&rdquo; (As reflected by the &ldquo;whether disclosure is proper&rdquo; language, the amendment makes no effort to define the disclosure standard; that matter is currently governed by <em>Douglas Oil</em> and the authorities cited therein, and is best left to elaboration by future case law.) The amendment expresses a preference for having the disclosure issue decided by the grand jury court. Yet, it must be recognized, as stated in <em>Douglas Oil</em>, that often this will not be possible because</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">the judges of the court having custody of the grand jury transcripts will have no first-hand knowledge of the litigation in which the transcripts allegedly are needed, and no practical means by which such knowledge can be obtained. In such a case, a judge in the district of the grand jury cannot weigh in an informed manner the need for disclosure against the need for maintaining grand jury secrecy.</p>
<p class="note-body">The penultimate sentence provides that upon transfer the transferring court shall order transmitted the material sought to be disclosed and also a written evaluation of the need for continuing grand jury secrecy. Because the transferring court is in the best position to assess the interest in continued grand jury secrecy in the particular instance, it is important that the court which will now have to balance that interest against the need for disclosure receive the benefit of the transferring court's assessment. Transmittal of the material sought to be disclosed will not only facilitate timely disclosure if it is thereafter ordered, but will also assist the other court in deciding how great the need for disclosure actually is. For example, with that material at hand the other court will be able to determine if there is any inconsistency between certain grand jury testimony and testimony received in the other judicial proceeding. The rule recognizes, however, that there may be instances in which transfer of everything sought to be disclosed is not feasible. See, e.g., <em>In re 1975&ndash;2 Grand Jury Investigation</em>, 566 F.2d 1293 (5th Cir. 1978) (court ordered transmittal of &ldquo;an inventory of the grand jury subpoenas, transcripts, and documents,&rdquo; as the materials in question were &ldquo;exceedingly voluminous, filling no less than 55 large file boxes and one metal filing cabinet&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence makes it clear that in a case in which the matter is transferred to another court, that court should permit the various interested parties specified in the rule to be heard. Even if those persons were previously heard before the court which ordered the transfer, this will not suffice. The order of transfer did not decide the ultimate issue of &ldquo;whether a particularized need for disclosure outweighs the interest in continued grand jury secrecy,&rdquo; <em>Douglas Oil</em>, supra, which is what now remains to be resolved by the court to which transfer was made. Cf. <em>In re 1975&ndash;2 Grand Jury Investigation</em>, supra, holding that a transfer order is not appealable because it does not determine the ultimate question of disclosure, and thus &ldquo;[n]o one has yet been aggrieved and no one will become aggrieved until [the court to which the matter was transferred] acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(5). This addition to rule 6 would make it clear that certain hearings which would reveal matters which have previously occurred before a grand jury or are likely to occur before a grand jury with respect to a pending or ongoing investigation must be conducted in camera in whole or in part in order to prevent public disclosure of such secret information. One such hearing is that conducted under subdivision (e)(3)(D), for it will at least sometimes be necessary to consider and assess some of the &ldquo;matters occurring before the grand jury&rdquo; in order to decide the disclosure issue. Two other kinds of hearings at which information about a particular grand jury investigation might need to be discussed are those at which the question is whether to grant a grand jury witness immunity or whether to order a grand jury witness to comply fully with the terms of a subpoena directed to him.</p>
<p class="note-body">A recent GAO study established that there is considerable variety in the practice as to whether such hearings are closed or open, and that open hearings often seriously jeopardize grand jury secrecy:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">For judges to decide these matters, the witness&rsquo; relationship to the case under investigation must be discussed. Accordingly, the identities of witnesses and targets, the nature of expected testimony, and the extent to which the witness is cooperating are often revealed during preindictment proceedings. Because the matters discussed can compromise the purposes of grand jury secrecy, some judges close the preindictment proceedings to the public and the press; others do not. When the proceeding is open, information that may otherwise be kept secret under rule 6(e) becomes available to the public and the press .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Open preindictment proceedings are a major source of information which can compromise the purposes of grand jury secrecy. In 25 cases we were able to establish links between open proceedings and later newspaper articles containing information about the identities of witnesses and targets and the nature of grand jury investigations.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Comptroller General, More Guidance and Supervision Needed over Federal Grand Jury Proceedings 8&ndash;9 (Oct. 16, 1980).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of rule 6(e)(5) do not violate any constitutional right of the public or media to attend such pretrial hearings. There is no Sixth Amendment right in the public to attend pretrial proceedings, <em>Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale</em>, 443 U.S. 368 (1979), and <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia</em>, 448 U.S. 555, (1980), only recognizes a First Amendment &ldquo;right to attend criminal trials.&rdquo; <em>Richmond Newspapers</em> was based largely upon the &ldquo;unbroken, uncontradicted history&rdquo; of public trials, while in <em>Gannett</em> it was noted &ldquo;there exists no persuasive evidence that at common law members of the public had any right to attend pretrial proceedings.&rdquo; Moreover, even assuming some public right to attend certain pretrial proceedings, see <em>United States v. Criden</em>, 675 F.2d 550 (3d Cir. 1982), that right is not absolute; it must give way, as stated in <em>Richmond Newspapers</em>, to &ldquo;an overriding interest&rdquo; in a particular case in favor of a closed proceeding. By permitting closure only &ldquo;to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury,&rdquo; rule 6(e)(5) recognizes the longstanding interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. Counsel or others allowed to be present at the closed hearing may be put under a protective order by the court.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (e)(5) is expressly made &ldquo;subject to any right to an open hearing in contempt proceedings.&rdquo; This will accommodate any First Amendment right which might be deemed applicable in that context because of the proceedings&rsquo; similarities to a criminal trial, cf. <em>United States v. Criden</em>, supra, and also any Fifth or Sixth Amendment right of the contemnor. The latter right clearly exists as to a criminal contempt proceeding, <em>In re Oliver</em>, 333 U.S. 257 (1948), and some authority is to be found recognizing such a right in civil contempt proceedings as well. <em>In re Rosahn</em>, 671 F.2d 690 (2d Cir. 1982). This right of the contemnor must be requested by him and, in any event, does not require that the entire contempt proceedings, including recitation of the substance of the questions he has refused to answer, be public. <em>Levine v. United States</em>, 362 U.S. 610 (1960).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(6). Subdivision (e)(6) provides that records, orders and subpoenas relating to grand jury proceedings shall be kept under seal to the extent and for so long as is necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury. By permitting such documents as grand jury subpoenas and immunity orders to be kept under seal, this provision addresses a serious problem of grand jury secrecy and expressly authorizes a procedure now in use in many but not all districts. As reported in Comptroller General, More Guid<!-- PDFPage:31 -->ance and Supervision Needed over Federal Grand Jury Proceedings 10, 14 (Oct. 16, 1980):</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">In 262 cases, documents presented at open preindictment proceedings and filed in public files revealed details of grand jury investigations. These documents are, of course, available to anyone who wants them, including targets of investigations. [There are] two documents commonly found in public files which usually reveal the identities of witnesses and targets. The first document is a Department of Justice authorization to a U.S. attorney to apply to the court for a grant of immunity for a witness. The second document is the court's order granting the witness immunity from prosecution and compelling him to testify and produce requested information. </p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Subpoenas are the fundamental documents used during a grand jury's investigation because through subpoenas, grand juries can require witnesses to testify and produce documentary evidence for their consideration. Subpoenas can identify witnesses, potential targets, and the nature of an investigation. Rule 6(e) does not provide specific guidance on whether a grand jury's subpoena should be kept secret. Additionally, case law has not consistently stated whether the subpoenas are protected by rule 6(e).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">District courts still have different opinions about whether grand jury subpoenas should be kept secret. Out of 40 Federal District Courts we contacted, 36 consider these documents to be secret. However, 4 districts do make them available to the public.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (g). In its present form, subdivision 6(g) permits a grand jury to serve no more than 18 months after its members have been sworn, and absolutely no exceptions are permitted. (By comparison, under the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title I, 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;3331&ndash;3334, special grand juries may be extended beyond their basic terms of 18 months if their business has not been completed.) The purpose of the amendment is to permit some degree of flexibility as to the discharge of grand juries where the public interest would be served by an extension.</p>
<p class="note-body">As noted in <em>United States v. Fein</em>, 504 F.2d 1170 (2d Cir. 1974), upholding the dismissal of an indictment returned 9 days after the expiration of the 18&ndash;month period but during an attempted extension, under the present inflexible rule &ldquo;it may well be that criminal proceedings which would be in the public interest will be frustrated and that those who might be found guilty will escape trial and conviction.&rdquo; The present inflexible rule can produce several undesirable consequences, especially when complex fraud, organized crime, tax or antitrust cases are under investigation: (i) wastage of a significant amount of time and resources by the necessity of presenting the case once again to a successor grand jury simply because the matter could not be concluded before the term of the first grand jury expired; (ii) precipitous action to conclude the investigation before the expiration date of the grand jury; and (iii) potential defendants may be kept under investigation for a longer time because of the necessity to present the matter again to another grand jury.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to subdivision 6(g) permits extension of a regular grand jury only &ldquo;upon a determination that such extension is in the public interest.&rdquo; This permits some flexibility, but reflects the fact that extension of regular grand juries beyond 18 months is to be the exception and not the norm. The intention of the amendment is to make it possible for a grand jury to have sufficient extra time to wind up an investigation when, for example, such extension becomes necessary because of the unusual nature of the case or unforeseen developments.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because terms of court have been abolished, 28 U.S.C. &sect;138, the second sentence of subdivision 6(g) has been deleted.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1985 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(3)(A)(ii). Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) currently provides that an attorney for the government may disclose grand jury information, without prior judicial approval, to other government personnel whose assistance the attorney for the government deems necessary in conducting the grand jury investigation. Courts have differed over whether employees of state and local governments are &ldquo;government personnel&rdquo; within the meaning of the rule. Compare <em>In re Miami Federal Grand Jury No. 79&ndash;9</em>, 478 F.Supp. 490 (S.D.Fla. 1979), and <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings</em>, 445 F.Supp. 349 (D.R.I. 1978) (state and local personnel not included); with <em>In re 1979 Grand Jury Proceedings</em>, 479 F.Supp. 93 (E.D.N.Y. 1979) (state and local personnel included). The amendment clarifies the rule to include state and local personnel.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is clearly desirable that federal and state authorities cooperate, as they often do, in organized crime and racketeering investigations, in public corruption and major fraud cases, and in various other situations where federal and state criminal jurisdictions overlap. Because of such cooperation, government attorneys in complex grand jury investigations frequently find it necessary to enlist the help of a team of government agents. While the agents are usually federal personnel, it is not uncommon in certain types of investigations that federal prosecutors wish to obtain the assistance of state law enforcement personnel, which could be uniquely beneficial. The amendment permits disclosure to those personnel in the circumstances stated.</p>
<p class="note-body">It must be emphasized that the disclosure permitted is limited. The disclosure under this subdivision is permissible only in connection with the attorney for the government's &ldquo;duty to enforce federal criminal law&rdquo; and only to those personnel &ldquo;deemed necessary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to assist&rdquo; in the performance of that duty. Under subdivision (e)(3)(B), the material disclosed may not be used for any other purpose, and the names of persons to whom disclosure is made must be promptly provided to the court.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(3)(B). The amendment to subdivision (e)(3)(B) imposes upon the attorney for the government the responsibility to certify to the district court that he has advised those persons to whom disclosure was made under subdivision (e)(3)(A)(ii) of their obligation of secrecy under Rule 6. Especially with the amendment of subdivision (e)(3)(A)(ii) to include personnel of a state or subdivision of a state, who otherwise would likely be unaware of this obligation of secrecy, the giving of such advice is an important step in ensuring against inadvertent breach of grand jury secrecy. But because not all federal government personnel will otherwise know of this obligation, the giving of the advice and certification thereof is required as to <em>all</em> persons receiving disclosure under subdivision (e)(3)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e)(3)(C). It sometimes happens that during a federal grand jury investigation evidence will be developed tending to show a violation of state law. When this occurs, it is very frequently the case that this evidence cannot be communicated to the appropriate state officials for further investigation. For one thing, any state officials who might seek this information must show particularized need. <em>Illinois v. Abbott & Associates</em>, 103 S.Ct. 1356 (1983). For another, and more significant, it is often the case that the information relates to a state crime outside the context of any pending or even contemplated state judicial proceeding, so that the &ldquo;preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding&rdquo; requirement of subdivision (e)(3)(C)(i) cannot be met.</p>
<p class="note-body">This inability lawfully to disclose evidence of a state criminal violation&mdash;evidence legitimately obtained by the grand jury&mdash;constitutes an unreasonable barrier to the effective enforcement of our two-tiered system of criminal laws. It would be removed by new subdivision (e)(3)(C)(iv), which would allow a court to permit disclosure to a state or local official for the purpose of enforcing state law when an attorney for the government so requests and makes the requisite showing.</p>
<p class="note-body">The federal court has been given control over any disclosure which is authorized, for subdivision (e)(3)(C) <!-- PDFPage:32 -->presently states that &ldquo;the disclosure shall be made in such manner, at such time, and under such conditions as the court may direct.&rdquo; The Committee is advised that it will be the policy of the Department of Justice under this amendment to seek such disclosure only upon approval of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division. There is no intention, by virtue of this amendment, to have federal grand juries act as an arm of the state.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1987 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">New subdivision (a)(2) gives express recognition to a practice now followed in some district courts, namely, that of designating alternate grand jurors at the time the grand jury is selected. (A person so designated does not attend court and is not paid the jury attendance fees and expenses authorized by 28 U.S.C. &sect;1871 unless subsequently impanelled pursuant to Rule 6(g).) Because such designation may be a more efficient procedure than election of additional grand jurors later as need arises under subdivision (g), the amendment makes it clear that it is a permissible step in the grand jury selection process.</p>
<p class="note-body">This amendment is not intended to work any change in subdivision (g). In particular, the fact that one or more alternate jurors either have or have not been previously designated does not limit the district court's discretion under subdivision (g) to decide whether, if a juror is excused temporarily or permanently, another person should replace him to assure the continuity of the grand jury and its ability to obtain a quorum in order to complete its business.</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendments [subdivisions (c) and (f)] are technical. No substantive change is intended.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Use of Indictment or Information</cap-smallcap>. An offense which may be punished by death shall be prosecuted by indictment. An offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or at hard labor shall be prosecuted by indictment or, if indictment is waived, it may be prosecuted by information. Any other offense may be prosecuted by indictment or by information. An information may be filed without leave of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Indictment</cap-smallcap>. An offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or at hard labor may be prosecuted by information if the defendant, after having been advised of the nature of the charge and of the rights of the defendant, waives in open court prosecution by indictment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Nature and Contents.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>In General</em>. The indictment or the information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall be signed by the attorney for the government. It need not contain a formal commencement, a formal conclusion or any other matter not necessary to such statement. Allegations made in one count may be incorporated by reference in another count. It may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more specified means. The indictment or information shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Criminal Forfeiture</em>. No judgment of forfeiture may be entered in a criminal proceeding unless the indictment or the information shall allege the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Harmless Error</em>. Error in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or information or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to the defendant's prejudice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Surplusage</cap-smallcap>. The court on motion of the defendant may strike surplusage from the indictment or information.</p>

<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). 1. This rule gives effect to the following provision of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States: &ldquo;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury &rdquo;. An infamous crime has been defined as a crime punishable by death or by imprisonment in a penitentiary or at hard labor, <em>Ex parte Wilson</em>, 114 U.S. 417, 427; <em>United States v. Moreland</em>, 258 U.S. 433. Any sentence of imprisonment for a term of over one year may be served in a penitentiary, if so directed by the Attorney General, 18 U.S.C. 753f [now 4082, 4083] (Commitment of persons by any court of the United States and the juvenile court of the District of Columbia; place of confinement; transfers). Consequently any offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of over one year is an infamous crime.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Petty offenses and misdemeanors for which no infamous punishment is prescribed may now be prosecuted by information, 18 U.S.C. 541 [see 1] (Felonies and misdemeanors); <em>Duke v. United States</em>, 301 U.S. 492.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. For a discussion of the provision for waiver of indictment, see Note to Rule 7(b), <em>infra.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">4. Presentment is not included as an additional type of formal accusation, since presentments as a method of instituting prosecutions are obsolete, at least as concerns the Federal courts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). 1. Opportunity to waive indictment and to consent to prosecution by information will be a substantial aid to defendants, especially those who, because of inability to give bail, are incarcerated pending action of the grand jury, but desire to plead guilty. This rule is particularly important in those districts in which considerable intervals occur between sessions of the grand jury. In many districts where the grand jury meets infrequently a defendant unable to give bail and desiring to plead guilty is compelled to spend many days, and sometimes many weeks, and even months, in jail before he can begin the service of his sentence, whatever it may be, awaiting the action of a grand jury. Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 654&ndash;655; Vanderbilt, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 376, 377; Robinson, 27 Jour. of the Am. Judicature Soc. 38, 45; Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 3. The rule contains safeguards against improvident waivers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, in September 1941, recommended that &ldquo;existing law or established procedure be so changed, that a defendant may waive indictment and plead guilty to an information filed by a United States attorney in all cases except capital felonies.&rdquo; <em>Report of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges</em> (1941) 13. In September 1942 the Judicial Conference recommended that provision be made &ldquo;for waiver of indictment and jury trial, so that persons accused of crime may not be held in jail needlessly pending trial.&rdquo; <em>Id</em>. (1942) 8.</p>
<p class="note-body">Attorneys General of the United States have from time to time recommended legislation to permit defendants to waive indictment and to consent to prosecution by information. See <em>Annual Report of the Attorney General of the United States</em> (Mitchell) (1931) 3; <em>Id</em>. (Mitchell) (1932) 6; <em>Id</em>. (Cummings) (1933) 1, (1936) 2, (1937) 11, (1938) 9; <em>Id</em>. (Murphy) (1939) 7.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act [now 18 U.S.C. 5031&ndash;5037], now permits a juvenile charged with an offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment to consent to prosecution by information on a charge of juvenile delinquency, 18 U.S.C. 922 [now 5032, 5033].</p>
<p class="note-body">2. On the constitutionality of this rule, see <em>United States v. Gill</em>, 55 F.2d 399 (D.N.M.), holding that the constitutional guaranty of indictment by grand jury may be waived by defendant. It has also been held that other constitutional guaranties may be waived by the defendant, e. g., <em>Patton v. United States</em>, 281 U.S. 276 (trial by jury); <em>Johnson v. Zerbst</em>, 304 U.S. 458, 465 (right of counsel); <em>Trono v. United States</em>, 199 U.S. 521, 534 (protection against double jeopardy); <em>United States v. Murdock</em>, 284 U.S. 141, 148 (privilege against self-incrimination); <em>Diaz v. United States</em>, 223 U.S. 442, 450 (right of confrontation).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). 1. This rule introduces a simple form of indictment, illustrated by Forms 1 to 11 in the Appendix of Forms. Cf. Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C., Appendix]. For discussion of the effect of this rule and a comparison between the present form of indictment and the simple form introduced by this rule, see Vanderbilt, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 376, 377; Homer Cummings, 29 A.B.A.Jour. 654, 655; Holtzoff, 3 F.R.D. 445, 448&ndash;449; Holtzoff, 12 Geo. Washington L.R. 119, 123&ndash;126; Medalie, 4 Lawyers Guild R. (3)1, 3.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The provision contained in the fifth sentence that it may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown, or that he committed it by one or more specified means, is intended to eliminate the use of multiple counts for the purpose of alleging the commission of the offense by different means or in different ways. Cf. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 8(e)(2) [28 U.S.C., Appendix].</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The law at present regards citations to statutes or regulations as not a part of the indictment. A conviction may be sustained on the basis of a statute or regulation other than that cited. <em>Williams v. United States</em>, 168 U.S. 382, 389; <em>United States v. Hutcheson</em>, 312 U.S. 219, 229. The provision of the rule, in view of the many statutes and regulations, is for the benefit of the defendant and is not intended to cause a dismissal of the indictment, but simply to provide a means by which he can be properly informed without danger to the prosecution.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This rule introduces a means of protecting the defendant against immaterial or irrelevant allegations in an indictment or information, which may, however, be prejudicial. The authority of the court to strike such surplusage is to be limited to doing so on defendant's motion, in the light of the rule that the guaranty of indictment by a grand jury implies that an indictment may not be amended, <em>Ex parte Bain</em>, 121 U.S. 1. By making such a motion, the defendant would, however, waive his rights in this respect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (e). This rule continues the existing law that, unlike an indictment, an information may be amended, <em>Muncy v. United States</em>, 289 F. 780 (C.C.A. 4th).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (f). This rule is substantially a restatement of existing law on bills of particulars.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1966 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to the first sentence eliminating the requirement of a showing of cause is designed to encourage a more liberal attitude by the courts toward bills of particulars without taking away the discretion which courts must have in dealing with such motions in individual cases. For an illustration of wise use of this discretion see the opinion by Justice Whittaker written when he was a district judge in <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 16 F.R.D. 372 (W.D.Mo. 1954).</p>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to the second sentence gives discretion to the court to permit late filing of motions for bills of particulars in meritorious cases. Use of late motions for the purpose of delaying trial should not, of course, be permitted. The courts have not been agreed as to their power to accept late motions in the absence of a local rule or a previous order. See <em>United States v. Miller</em>, 217 F.Supp. 760 (E.D.Pa. 1963); <em>United States v. Taylor</em>, 25 F.R.D. 225 (E.D.N.Y. 1960); <em>United States v. Sterling</em>, 122 F.Supp. 81 (E.D.Pa. 1954) (all taking a limited view of the power of the court). But cf. <em>United States v. Brown</em>, 179 F.Supp. 893 (E.D.N.Y. 1959) (exercising discretion to permit an out of time motion).</p>

<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c)(2) is new. It is intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title IX, &sect;1963, and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II, &sect;408(a)(2).</p>

The legislative history of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 indicates a congressional purpose to have similar procedures apply to the forfeiture of profits or interests under that act. H. Rep. No. 91&ndash;1444 (part I), 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 81&ndash;85 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the common law, in a criminal forfeiture proceeding the defendant was apparently entitled to notice, trial, and a special jury finding on the factual issues surrounding the declaration of forfeiture which followed his criminal conviction. Subdivision (c)(2) provides for notice. Changes in rules 31 and 32 provide for a special jury finding and for a judgment authorizing the Attorney General to seize the interest or property forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The amendment to rule 7(c)(2) is intended to clarify its meaning. Subdivision (c)(2) was added in 1972, and, as noted in the Advisory Committee Note thereto, was &ldquo;intended to provide procedural implementation of the recently enacted criminal forfeiture provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Title IX, &sect;1963, and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II, &sect;408(a)(2).&rdquo; These provisions reestablished a limited common law criminal forfeiture, necessitating the addition of subdivision (c)(2) and corresponding changes in rules 31 and 32, for at common law the defendant in a criminal forfeiture proceeding was entitled to notice, trial, and a special jury finding on the factual issues surrounding the declaration of forfeiture which followed his criminal conviction.</p>
<p class="note-body">Although there is some doubt as to what forfeitures should be characterized as &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;remedial,&rdquo; see Note, 62 Cornell L.Rev. 768 (1977), subdivision (c)(2) is intended to apply to those forfeitures which are criminal in the sense that they result from a special verdict under rule 31(e) and a judgment under rule 32(b)(2), and not to those resulting from a separate in rem proceeding. Because some confusion in this regard has resulted from the present wording of subdivision (c)(2), <em>United States v. Hall</em>, 521 F.2d 406 (9th Cir. 1975), a clarifying amendment is in order.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>. Upon the request of the attorney for the government the court shall issue a warrant for each defendant named in an information supported by a showing of probable cause under oath as is required by Rule 4(a), or in an indictment. Upon the request of the attorney for the government a summons instead of a warrant shall issue. If no request is made, the court may issue either a warrant or a summons in its discretion. More than one warrant or summons may issue for the same defendant. The clerk shall deliver the warrant or summons to the marshal or other person authorized by law to execute or serve it. If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, a warrant shall issue. When a defendant arrested with a warrant <!-- PDFPage:35 -->or given a summons appears initially before a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with the applicable subdivisions of Rule 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Form.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Warrant</em>. The form of the warrant shall be as provided in Rule 4(c)(1) except that it shall be signed by the clerk, it shall describe the offense charged in the indictment or information and it shall command that the defendant be arrested and brought before the nearest available magistrate judge. The amount of bail may be fixed by the court and endorsed on the warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Summons</em>. The summons shall be in the same form as the warrant except that it shall summon the defendant to appear before a magistrate judge at a stated time and place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Execution or Service; and Return.</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Execution or Service</em>. The warrant shall be executed or the summons served as provided in Rule 4(d)(1), (2) and (3). A summons to a corporation shall be served by delivering a copy to an officer or to a managing or general agent or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and, if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the corporation's last known address within the district or at its principal place of business elsewhere in the United States. The officer executing the warrant shall bring the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, in the event that a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &sect;3041.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Return</em>. The officer executing a warrant shall make return thereof to the magistrate judge or other officer before whom the defendant is brought. At the request of the attorney for the government any unexecuted warrant shall be returned and cancelled. On or before the return day the person to whom a summons was delivered for service shall make return thereof. At the request of the attorney for the government made at any time while the indictment or information is pending, a warrant returned unexecuted and not cancelled or a summons returned unserved or a duplicate thereof may be delivered by the clerk to the marshal or other authorized person for execution or service.</p>

<p class="note-body">2. The provision of Rule 9(a) that a warrant may be issued on the basis of an information only if the latter is supported by oath is necessitated by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. See <em>Albrecht v. United States</em>, 273 U.S. 1, 5.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1972 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (b) is amended to make clear that the person arrested shall be brought before a United States magistrate if the information or indictment charges a &ldquo;minor offense&rdquo; triable by the United States magistrate.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (c) is amended to reflect the office of United States magistrate.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (d) is new. It provides for a remand to the United States magistrate of cases in which the person is charged with a &ldquo;minor offense.&rdquo; The magistrate can then proceed in accordance with rule 5 to try the case if the right to trial before a judge of the district court is waived.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1974 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Rule 9 is revised to give high priority to the issuance of a summons unless a &ldquo;valid reason&rdquo; is given for the issuance of an arrest warrant. See a comparable provision in rule 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under the rule, a summons will issue by the clerk unless the attorney for the government presents a valid reason for the issuance of an arrest warrant. Under the old rule, it has been argued that the court must issue an arrest warrant if one is desired by the attorney for the government. See authorities listed in Frankel, Bench Warrants Upon the Prosecutor's Demand: A View From the Bench, 71 Colum.L.Rev. 403, 410 n. 25 (1971). For an expression of the view that this is undesirable policy, see Frankel, <em>supra</em>, pp. 410&ndash;415.</p>
<p class="note-body">A summons may issue if there is an information supported by oath. The indictment itself is sufficient to establish the existence of probable cause. See C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;151 (1969); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice &nbsp;9.02[2] at p. 9&ndash;4 (2d ed.) Cipes (1969); <em>Giordenello v. United States</em>, 357 U.S. 480, 78 S.Ct. 1245, 2 L.Ed. 2d 1503 (1958). This is not necessarily true in the case of an information. See C. Wright, <em>supra</em>, &sect;151; 8 J. Moore, <em>supra</em>, &nbsp;9.02. If the government requests a warrant rather than a summons, good practice would obviously require the judge to satisfy himself that there is probable cause. This may appear from the information or from an affidavit filed with the information. Also a defendant can, at a proper time, challenge an information issued without probable cause.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 94&ndash;247; 1975 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">A. Amendments Proposed by the Supreme Court. Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is closely related to Rule 4. Rule 9 deals with arrest procedures after an information has been filed or an indictment returned. The present rule gives the prosecutor the authority to decide whether a summons or a warrant shall issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Supreme Court's amendments to Rule 9 parallel its amendments to Rule 4. The basic change made in Rule 4 is also made in Rule 9.</p>
<p class="note-body">B. Committee Action. For the reasons set forth above in connection with Rule 4, the Committee endorses and accepts the basic change in Rule 9. The Committee made changes in Rule 9 similar to the changes it made in Rule 4.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1979 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subdivision (a) is amended to make explicit the fact that a warrant may issue upon the basis of an information only if the information or an affidavit filed with <!-- PDFPage:36 -->the information shows probable cause for the arrest. This has generally been assumed to be the state of the law even though not specifically set out in rule 9; see C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal &sect;151 (1969); 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice par. 9.02[2] (2d ed. 1976).</p>
<p class="note-body">In <em>Gerstein v. Pugh</em>, 420 U.S. 103 (1975), the Supreme Court rejected the contention &ldquo;that the prosecutor's decision to file an information is itself a determination of probable cause that furnishes sufficient reason to detain a defendant pending trial,&rdquo; commenting:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Although a conscientious decision that the evidence warrants prosecution affords a measure of protection against unfounded detention, we do not think prosecutorial judgment standing alone meets the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, we think the Court's previous decisions compel disapproval of [such] procedure. In <em>Albrecht v. United States</em>, 273 U.S. 1, 5, 47 S.Ct. 250, 251, 71 L.Ed. 505 (1927), the Court held that an arrest warrant issued solely upon a United States Attorney's information was invalid because the accompanying affidavits were defective. Although the Court's opinion did not explicitly state that the prosecutor's official oath could not furnish probable cause, that conclusion was implicit in the judgment that the arrest was illegal under the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p class="note-body">No change is made in the rule with respect to warrants issuing upon indictments. In <em>Gerstein</em>, the Court indicated it was not disturbing the prior rule that &ldquo;an indictment, &lsquo;fair upon its face,&rsquo; and returned by a &lsquo;properly constituted grand jury&rsquo; conclusively determines the existence of probable cause and requires issuance of an arrest warrant without further inquiry.&rdquo; See <em>Ex parte United States</em>, 287 U.S. 241, 250 (1932).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision to the effect that a summons shall issue &ldquo;by direction of the court&rdquo; has been eliminated because it conflicts with the first sentence of the rule, which states that a warrant &ldquo;shall&rdquo; issue when requested by the attorney for the government, if properly supported. However, an addition has been made providing that if the attorney for the government does not make a request for either a warrant or summons, then the court may in its discretion issue either one. Other stylistic changes ensure greater consistency with comparable provisions in rule 4.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1982 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (a). The amendment of subdivision (a), by reference to Rule 5, clarifies what is to be done once the defendant is brought before the magistrate. This means, among other things, that no preliminary hearing is to be held in a Rule 9 case, as Rule 5(c) provides that no such hearing is to be had &ldquo;if the defendant is indicted or if an information against the defendant is filed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (b). The amendment of subdivision (b) conforms Rule 9 to the comparable provisions in Rule 4(c)(1) and (2).</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (c). The amendment of subdivision (c) conforms Rule 9 to the comparable provisions in Rules 4(d)(4) and 5(a) concerning return of the warrant.</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Note to Subdivision</em> (d). This subdivision, incorrect in its present form in light of the recent amendment of 18 U.S.C. &sect;3401(a), has been abrogated as unnecessary in light of the change to subdivision (a).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules&mdash;1993 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Rule is amended to conform to the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 [P.L. 101&ndash;650, Title III, Section 321] which provides that each United States magistrate appointed under section 631 of title 28, United States Code, shall be known as a United States magistrate judge.</p>
