<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on section 1591 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties (June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, &sect;591, 46 Stat. 750; Aug. 5, 1935, ch. 438, title III, &sect;304(a), 49 Stat. 527).</p>
<p class="note-body">The reference in the first paragraph to persons aiding, contained in the phrase &ldquo;or aids,&rdquo; was omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &ldquo;upon conviction&rdquo; before &ldquo;be fined&rdquo; were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Enumeration of persons at beginning of section and provision preserving forfeitures where authorized by law were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fourth paragraph was added to the revised section to make clear the intent of Congress that forfeiture is an additional consequence independent of the criminal punishment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The final paragraph was added to conform with section 1709 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in phraseology were also made.</p>
